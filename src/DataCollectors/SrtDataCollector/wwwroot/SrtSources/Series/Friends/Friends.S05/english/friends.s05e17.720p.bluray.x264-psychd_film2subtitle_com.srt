1
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:06,171
- Good! You guys are all here.
- Hey, what's up?

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,967
Well, I have a job interview
at Ralph Lauren tomorrow.

3
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,011
- Oh!
- Congratulations!

4
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:15,055
Oh, boy.
That guy's underwear sucks!

5
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,726
- What?
- Well, I got this pair marked "XS."

6
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:21,895
Let me tell you, there was no room
for excess anything in there.

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,941
Anyway, I'm gonna be the coordinator
of the women's collection.

8
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,611
I'll work right under the director.
It's the perfect job for me.

9
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,156
Wow. Well, if you nail the interview,
you'll get it.

10
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,450
- Yeah.
- Want to work on your interview skills?

11
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:38,078
- Okay!
- Okay! Let's start with the handshake.

12
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:40,748
- Hi.
- Hi.

13
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,000
Very good handshake.
Good wrist action.

14
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,668
- Thank you.
- Let me try.

15
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,378
Okay.

16
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,673
Oh, my God!
What did I ever do to you?

17
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,258
Did I squeeze too hard?

18
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:55,137
Let's just say
I'm glad I'm not Chandler.

19
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:50,651
That's right, Ross. I can see you
in your new apartment. You see me.

20
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,613
Same as yesterday,
same as the day before.

21
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,615
Is he doing his "shark attack" bit yet?

22
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,493
No. Oh, wait! There he goes.

23
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,425
Very funny, Ross.

24
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:19,138
Very lifelike and funny. Okay.

25
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,976
Oh, no, no, no.
I wasn't waving at you, lady.

26
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,772
Whoa, maybe I was. Hey!

27
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,234
Monica, this hot girl in Ross' building
is flirting with me.

28
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,654
Get in there, man.
Flirt back. Mix it up!

29
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,490
Yeah, I'm down with that.

30
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,327
Okay, here it goes.

31
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,164
How...

32
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,915
...you...

33
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,418
...doing?

34
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,257
It worked! She's waving me over.
I'll be right over.

35
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,759
Let's see,
she's on the third floor...

36
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,303
Wow.

37
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,598
- She is pretty, huh?
- Tell me about it, huh?

38
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,807
Oh, no, no.

39
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,350
No, no! I'm not with her.

40
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,728
Oh, that's just Monica.

41
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,521
Blah!

42
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,457
Hey, Joey!

43
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,918
Great stuff, huh?

44
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,546
- This is your place?
- Yeah, of course it is. Oh, come on in.

45
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:39,051
Ooh, ohh. Uh, go by the window.
You can pretend to be surfing.

46
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,764
But I counted.
You're not supposed to live here.

47
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,307
Oh, man!

48
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,772
- Unh!
- What happened?

49
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,068
I ended up at Ross' place.
I must have miscounted or something.

50
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,529
Damn! She's not there anymore.

51
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,950
Oh, look, Ross is doing
his "watching TV" bit.

52
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,455
No, Joe, I think he's just watching TV.

53
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,677
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.

54
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,429
Okay, now I really have to go.

55
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,641
It's so unfair that
our date has to get cut short...

56
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,602
...just because some guy
shot at a store clerk.

57
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,731
- I know, but it's my job.
- Then maybe I could come too?

58
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,902
Suspect has
just emerged naked from the sewer.

59
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,654
All right, you go.

60
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,076
- Bye-bye.
- Okay. Bye.

61
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,873
- Oh, God!
- What?

62
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,126
Oh, I just miss him so much!

63
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,630
Wow.

64
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,674
For just a week,
you guys are close, huh?

65
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,261
Yeah, it's weird.
I can't help it, though. He's so sweet.

66
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,805
He's like this little puppy dog, you know?

67
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:11,018
But like a really tough one
who shoots bad guys.

68
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,938
Ugh, I love the beginning parts
of relationships, you know?

69
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,357
You can't keep your hands
off each other.

70
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,526
- I know. It is the best. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

71
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,363
God, how long did that last
for you and Chandler?

72
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,908
What? It's still going on.

73
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,995
Come on, seriously.
When did it end?

74
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:34,541
I am serious. We're all over
each other all the time.

75
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,211
Okay, you know where you are
better than I do. I was just curious.

76
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,547
Why don't you just calm down,
Phoebe, all right?

77
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:46,803
Get all your facts before you tell
everybody you're the only hot couple.

78
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,639
God, I woke the beast. Um...

79
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,686
I was wrong obviously.
I just misspoke. It's okay.

80
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,229
Well, it is okay. I mean...

81
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,733
As long as you know Chandler and I
are also hot and fiery.

82
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,401
I mean, just as hot as you.

83
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,819
I mean, our flame...

84
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,322
Whoo! It is on fire!

85
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,617
Monica, here's your broom back.

86
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,746
You are so cute.

87
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,047
- Oh, hey! How'd the interview go?
- Ugh!

88
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:26,176
Horrible! I did the stupidest,
most embarrassing thing.

89
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:30,305
Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex
with his wife then fall off your chair?

90
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,141
- No.
- So, what happened?

91
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,770
Ugh, it was horrible!
And the interview part went so well.

92
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,399
You know, like, I even made him laugh.
He said something about a boat...

93
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:46,696
...and I was like, "Well, yeah,
if you've got enough life jackets."

94
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,410
Trust me. It was actually very funny.

95
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:56,331
Anyway, so we were
saying goodbye and, uh... Ugh.

96
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,543
- What happened?
- All right, we were shaking hands...

97
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,255
...and he kind of leaned in toward me.
Maybe he was going to open the door.

98
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,634
But I totally misread him and I, uh...

99
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,601
You kissed him?

100
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,979
I didn't know what else to do!

101
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,189
Well, you could have tried...

102
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,983
...not kissing him.

103
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,818
Thanks, Chandler.

104
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,112
Hey, Rach,
a guy from Ralph Lauren called.

105
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,738
You got a second interview.

106
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,408
- I can't believe it! I got a second interview.
- Yes!

107
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,619
That kiss isn't looking like
such a mistake now, is it?

108
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,789
Wait a minute, wait. You don't think
that's why he wants me back?

109
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,833
Yeah!

110
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,835
No?

111
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,171
Kiss? What are you talking about?

112
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,215
Ugh, I accidentally kissed him
in the interview...

113
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,217
...and now he wants me back of course...

114
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:53,388
...because, "Let's bring back
the girl who kisses everybody"!

115
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,183
Come on, Rach.

116
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,811
What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl
that'll just sleep with him?

117
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,397
He wants you back
because you're right for the job.

118
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:06,443
Maybe. I don't know. Oh, God!
How could I be so stupid?

119
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,153
Oh, Rachel, look, don't say that.

120
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,697
I think you just need a hug
from Joey. Heh.

121
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,408
Come on. Come on, ha-ha-ha.

122
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,077
She's back! Hot girl's back!

123
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:19,789
Aw, well, I'm not totally back yet.
But I appreciate it.

124
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:23,376
No, in Ross' building. She's back!
She's back!

125
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,670
Okay, wait there. I'll be over in a second.

126
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,340
One, two, three. Got it!

127
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,763
I gotta check out this hot girl.

128
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,474
There she is!

129
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,776
Damn it! Did you move?

130
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,861
Yes.

131
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,323
I lived with you for a while.
Then I found this place.

132
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,036
I'm Ross.

133
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,797
Yes?

134
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,551
Uh...

135
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,178
Do you happen to have
a hot girl in there?

136
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,307
No, I'm all alone.

137
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,309
Yeah. Sorry about that.

138
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,527
Oh. Hey, little girl.

139
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:35,240
Is your mommy or sister or babysitter
by any chance, a hot girl?

140
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,536
- Daddy!
- Later, girl! Aah.

141
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,750
Oh, man!

142
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,255
Hot girl?

143
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,800
Hot girl!

144
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,890
- Hi, Rachel. Come on in.
- Hi. Okay.

145
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,476
- Ahem.
- It's nice to see you again.

146
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,145
Thank you.

147
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,522
Oh, Rachel, uh...

148
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,318
- What?
- Just, uh...

149
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,069
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, let me...

150
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,279
Whoa, eh, oh!

151
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,741
All right. Okay, I see what's going on here.
Now, listen, look...

152
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,201
...I am sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression.

153
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:24,539
But I am not some hussy who will
just sleep around to get ahead.

154
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,749
- Now... Eh, eh!
- Well...

155
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,376
Even though I kissed you,
that does not give you...

156
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:33,423
...the right to demand sex from me!
I do not want this job that bad.

157
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,175
Good day, sir.

158
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,600
Ugh, you are not gonna believe...

159
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,519
...what that sleazeball
from Ralph Lauren did to me.

160
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:54,027
Okay, that's amazing.
How did you know that?

161
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,279
You got ink on your lip.

162
00:10:56,447 --> 00:11:01,409
Oh.

163
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,584
What do you say, maybe,
sometime I hold your gun?

164
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,753
I don't know.
We're not supposed to do that.

165
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,171
What could happen? I mean...

166
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,343
Yeah. I'm gonna say no.

167
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,222
Do you want to see a movie
after dinner tonight?

168
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,349
Oh, we can't. We already have plans.

169
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,267
What are you doing?

170
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:30,897
Um, well, same thing we did all day.
Just hang out at Gary's apartment.

171
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,109
He is so amazing.
We never left the bedroom.

172
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,279
But have fun at the movie.

173
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,575
Uh, ha, ha.
Well, we're not seeing a movie.

174
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,370
You're not? Why did you ask us
if we wanted to go?

175
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:49,374
Oh, um, because I just wanted
to know what you were doing...

176
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,711
...so you wouldn't walk in
on me and Chandler...

177
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,255
...while we were doing it all night.

178
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,509
- Will you excuse me just a second? Okay.
- Yeah.

179
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,681
Chandler? Can I see you for a second?

180
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,766
- Uh, yeah.
- Okay, heh.

181
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,563
- We have got to beat them!
- Why?

182
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,358
Because Gary and Phoebe think
they're a hotter couple than we are.

183
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,694
- Oh! So?
- So?

184
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,282
So we've gotta go have a lot of sex
and prove them wrong!

185
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,744
You have got to stop this
competitive thing. It's crazy.

186
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,495
Just to impress Gary and Phoebe...

187
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,415
...you want me to go upstairs
and have sex over and over...

188
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,668
...and I'm saying no to this why?
Get your coat!

189
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,848
- Hey.
- Hi.

190
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,308
Excuse me.

191
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,398
You should check this out.
Tell the other tenants.

192
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,818
Apparently, he's running around
looking for some kind of hot girl.

193
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,655
Who isn't?

194
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,414
I don't think we've met. I'm Ross.

195
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,835
I know. You're the guy who
wouldn't chip in for the handyman.

196
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,922
Never mind.

197
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:23,426
No, I actually thought it was unfair
the way everyone reacted.

198
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,637
I mean, you had just moved in.

199
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,306
I had just moved in!

200
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,266
Thank you!

201
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,019
Listen, um...

202
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,854
- Jen.
- Jen.

203
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,065
I know this may sound a little:

204
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,239
But, uh, would you want to grab
a cup of coffee sometime?

205
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,116
Sure, that would be nice.

206
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,868
- Um...
- Oh.

207
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,622
My number's on there.
Give me a call.

208
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,916
I will give you a call. Heh.

209
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,960
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

210
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,259
I forgot my paper.

211
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,474
- That was amazing.
- Ugh.

212
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:15,520
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna
hear about this at dinner.

213
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,314
That was amazing.

214
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,526
We are the hottest, huh?

215
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,320
No one is hotter than we are.

216
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,031
- We're the best.
- No, you're the best.

217
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,241
Aw.

218
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,452
- No, you're the best.
- No, you're the best.

219
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,663
I am the best.

220
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,625
Hey, guys.

221
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,210
What you been doing?

222
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,760
Hey, Joey, isn't that the girl
who waved at you the other day?

223
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,680
I don't know,
but I can see through your sheet.

224
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,311
Yeah. Yeah, that's her.
But you know what? It doesn't matter.

225
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,354
- I'm never gonna meet her anyways.
- Why?

226
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,648
Because it's impossible
to find her apartment!

227
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:04,527
She lives in some hot-girl
parallel universe or something.

228
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,030
What are you talking about?

229
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,533
She lives on the 2nd floor,
7th apartment from the left.

230
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:14,662
No, no, no, she lives on the 3rd floor,
8th apartment from the left.

231
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,082
No. Those first two windows,
that's the lobby.

232
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,753
That other window is the stairway.
You've been counting wrong.

233
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,131
I did not know that!
Thank you, Monica.

234
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,217
I almost lost another girl
because of counting!

235
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,388
So, uh, you ready?

236
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,182
- Yeah, I'll just get my coat.
- Okay.

237
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,894
- Could you get that?
- Sure.

238
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,780
- Joey...?
- Aah! No! No!

239
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:59,499
Uh, first, I would like to say thank you
for agreeing to see me again.

240
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,000
That's, uh, quite all right.

241
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:05,505
But I feel obligated to tell you
that this meeting is being videotaped.

242
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,718
Okay. Um.

243
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:15,431
Well, first, I would like to start
by apologizing for kissing you...

244
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,809
...and, uh, for yelling at you.

245
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,686
Fair enough.

246
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:23,564
Now, you're probably going to hire
one of the people who, uh...

247
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:27,110
Who did... Who did not, um, ahem...

248
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,654
...yell at you and storm out.

249
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,657
And I think that's a big mistake.
And here's why.

250
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:37,370
I made a huge fool of myself,
and I came back. That shows courage.

251
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:42,041
When I thought you wanted sex
in exchange for this job, I said no.

252
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,793
That shows integrity.

253
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,754
And I was not afraid
to stand up for myself...

254
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,215
...and that shows courage.

255
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,801
Okay, ahem.

256
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,929
Now, I know that I've
already said courage...

257
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,557
...but you've got to have courage.

258
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,101
And, um, finally...

259
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,563
...when I thought you were making
sexual advances in the workplace...

260
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,065
...I said no, and I was not litigious.

261
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,276
So there you go. You got courage...

262
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:12,113
...you got integrity,
you got courage again...

263
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,033
...and not litigious.

264
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,411
Look, Mr...

265
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,788
- Zelner.
- Zelner!

266
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,248
I knew that!

267
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,375
Oh, I knew that.

268
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,004
I really, really want this job.

269
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:32,258
And I think I would be really good at it.

270
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,971
You know what?

271
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,142
I may regret this, but, uh...

272
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,228
...I'm gonna give you a shot.
- Oh, you are?

273
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,855
- Mm-hm.
- Really?

274
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,484
Oh, thank you. Oh, God!

275
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,528
Would it be inappropriate
if I gave you a hug?

276
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,863
- Yes.
- Okay.

277
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,200
Well, how about a handshake? Ha-ha-ha.

278
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,993
Aah! Oh, God! I'm sorry!

279
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,665
Oh, God, I did not mean to touch that!
I mean, you!

280
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,001
There! Uh, there. Um...

281
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,128
Okay, so, thank you.

282
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,090
I'm gonna leave. Thank you very much.
Thank you so much.

283
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,925
Hey, I'll see you Monday.

284
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,224
- Are you tired?
- You better believe he's tired...

285
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,059
...after the day we had!

286
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,062
If you know what I mean.
Do you know what I mean?

287
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,482
Honey? The tortilla chips
know what you mean.

288
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,277
So, uh, Chandler,
do you like that badge I got you?

289
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,488
Oh, yeah, it's so cool.

290
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:40,368
Now, I gotta go.
Officer Bing's got a 10-100.

291
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,330
That's pee-pee.

292
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,336
Phoebe, you have a twig in your hair.

293
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,089
Oh, ha, ha. Um...

294
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,217
We kind of took a detour
on our way over here.

295
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:00,054
We were strolling through the park
and no one was around, so...

296
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,640
- You didn't.
- We did!

297
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:07,520
Ha, ha. We violated section 12,
paragraph 7 of the criminal code.

298
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,733
- The park, huh?
- Ha, ha.

299
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,195
- Public place.
Uh-huh.

300
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,574
I hear you.
Can you excuse me for a second?

301
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,209
Hi, Chandler.

302
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,712
Monica, this is the men's room.

303
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,423
Isn't it?

304
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,010
Yes, it is.

305
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,763
But see, I've always found
the men's bathroom very sexual.

306
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,641
- Haven't you?
- No.

307
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,769
And if I did, I don't think
we'd be going out.

308
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,439
This is getting ridiculous.

309
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,233
- Come on, we can't let them win!
- Uh...

310
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:58,946
We've proved that we are hot, okay?
So why are you obsessed about this?

311
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,950
Phoebe and Gary are in that "can't keep
their hands off each other" phase!

312
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,578
- So?
- So.

313
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:09,832
It makes me really sad that
we're not really there anymore.

314
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,877
Oh, is that what
this has all been about?

315
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,673
Wasn't it a lot more exciting
when we were, you know...

316
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,176
...all over each other all the time?

317
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,804
Yeah, that was great.
That was really great.

318
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:27,350
But to tell you the truth,
I'm more excited about where we are now.

319
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,685
- Really?
- Yeah.

320
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,897
I've never been in a relationship
that's lasted this long before.

321
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,651
To get past the beginning and
still want to be around each other?

322
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,945
I think that's pretty incredible.

323
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,948
And the fact that
this is happening with you...

324
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,492
...I think that's pretty exciting.

325
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,123
That's so sweet.

326
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,169
I know that I was acting
a little crazy...

327
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,631
...but I feel the same way.
- Mm?

328
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,304
You know what I just realized?

329
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,640
You just freaked out
about our relationship.

330
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,725
- Pfft, I did not.
- Yes, you did!

331
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,394
Admit it. You freaked out!

332
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,105
I freaked out a little.

333
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:17,024
A little?
You freaked out bigtime, okay?

334
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,277
And I fixed it!
We have switched places.

335
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:24,031
I am the relationship king,
and you are the crazy, irrational screwup!

336
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,955
And now we're back.

337
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,968
I cannot believe Ross is buying this.
