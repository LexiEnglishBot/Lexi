1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,732
- Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
- Incredible!

2
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:07,565
I met the director this time
and you'll never believe who it was.

3
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:09,935
- Who?
- All right. I'll give you one hint.

4
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:11,942
Warren Beatty.

5
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,449
Yeah, there's just one thing
that might be kind of a problem.

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,213
See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.

7
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,282
'Cause he was just so darn cute.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,922
No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for
this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.

9
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:31,960
Well, hey. You're an actor,
I say you just suck it up and do it.

10
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:37,501
Or you just do it.

11
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,799
I did do it, I'm a professional.

12
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:45,811
Besides my first girlfriend was Lisa Dibertis,
so I am no stranger to the mustache.

13
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,877
Then what's the problem?

14
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,913
See after the scene,
Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says

15
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,082
'good actor, bad kisser'.

16
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:57,914
Can you believe that,
me not a good kisser,

17
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:02,192
that's like, like Mother
Theresa, not a good mother.

18
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,964
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks.
What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.

19
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:17,875
The one with Barry
And Mindy's Wedding

20
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:01,781
Hey, what did your agent say?

21
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:06,919
Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem,
Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday.

22
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,887
Man, I gotta figure out
what I'm doing wrong.

23
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:13,160
Oh, okay, one of you girls
come over here and kiss me.

24
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,093
- What, forget it!
- Yeah, right.

25
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,869
Come on, I need your help here.

26
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,698
All right. I'll do it, I kissed
him before I can do it again.

27
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,976
You see this, this is a friend.

28
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,308
Uh-huh, let's go.

29
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,746
Oh, wait I have gum.

30
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:29,914
Okay.

31
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,922
Good, very good, firm but tender.

32
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:42,954
I'd recommend you to a friend.

33
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,263
Then I don't know what it is.
What's the problem?

34
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,865
Joey, you know, maybe your
just not used to kissing men,

35
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,865
maybe you just tensed up a little,

36
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,565
maybe that's what you need to work on.

37
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,805
Yeah, that makes sense.

38
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,047
Over my dead body!

39
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,988
And I'll be using his
dead body as a shield.

40
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,224
Come on out, honey!
I'm telling you look good!

41
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,154
Tell her she looks good,
tell her she looks good.

42
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,300
Oh my God,

43
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,734
you look so good!

44
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,516
I can not believe I have to walk
down the aisle in front of 200 people

45
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,717
looking like something you
drink when your nauseous.

46
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:47,049
So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this
thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.

47
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,386
Because I promised Mindy I would.

48
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,894
Yeah, well you promised
Barry, you'd marry him.

49
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,196
Look you guys, I have to
go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor.

50
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,663
And besides you know what I just need

51
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,171
to be in a room again with these
people and feel good about myself.

52
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:15,917
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes
they had on last night. Someone get a little action?

53
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:19,215
- I may have.
- Woo-hoo, stuud!

54
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,118
- What's she look like?
- Well, we haven't exactly met,

55
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,523
we just stayed up all night
talking on the internet.

56
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,522
Woo-hoo, geeek!

57
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,397
I like this girl, okay,
I seriously like this girl,

58
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,363
you now how sometimes I tend get
a little defended and quipy...

59
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,508
- Get out!
- Nooo!

60
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:41,870
Well she totally called me on it, okay.
She said, 'cut it out, get real',

61
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:43,639
and I did.

62
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,116
Wow! What's that like?

63
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,150
It's like this,

64
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,755
me, no jokes.

65
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,123
All right, stop it,
you're freaking me out.

66
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,858
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way.

67
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:04,232
- All right, I'll see you guys later.
- Bye, Richard.

68
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,429
Bye sweetie,

69
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,934
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

70
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,543
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy,

71
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,151
I wonder what our
wedding's gonna be like.

72
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,686
What are you talking
about? What wedding?

73
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,484
Come on, like you
never talk about that.

74
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,958
Nooo! Never!

75
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,060
I mean, we're living in the moment.

76
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:36,500
God, it is so nice for once to not have to
get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'

77
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,061
- Afraid to ask him?
- Could not be more terrified.

78
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,874
Well, I think you should seriously
consider the marriage thing,

79
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,073
give Rachel another chance to
dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.

80
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:55,019
I was laughing at this
quip leno made last night.

81
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:59,024
I was not laughing at your dress,
I love you.

82
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,590
Where's Benny?

83
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,229
There he is!

84
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,297
Where's Benny,

85
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,066
there he is.

86
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,999
Awww! You know that's probably
why babies learn to talk,

87
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,937
so they can tell grown
ups to cut it out.

88
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,949
Hey, you know I got a question for ya.
Just a little thing, no pressure.

89
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:25,843
Okay.

90
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:31,284
Did you ever, uh, like,
think about the future?

91
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:32,750
Sure I do.

92
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,018
Yeah, am I in it?

93
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,464
Honey, you are it.

94
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,329
Oh God, you are about
to get sooo lucky.

95
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,169
Keep talkin'.

96
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:53,375
Well, uh, sometimes I think
about selling my practice,

97
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,349
we could move to France,

98
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,976
make French toast.

99
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:05,489
Okay, so, uh, we're in France,

100
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:07,519
we're making the toast.

101
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,122
Do you see a little
bassinet in the corner?

102
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,028
Like a hound?

103
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,871
Not a basset, a bassinet.

104
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,705
You really need the bassinet?

105
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,676
Well, I just think the baby
would keep falling off the dog.

106
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,813
Do you, uh, do you,
do you not see kids in our future.

107
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:37,216
Oh, hey, I love children,

108
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,213
I have children.

109
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,623
I just don't want to be 70

110
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:45,059
when our kids go off to college,
and our lives can finally start.

111
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:53,136
Look I want you, now.

112
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:55,835
That's Great.

113
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,743
You know we don't need
to talk about this now.

114
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,740
Really, I mean this is, is so
way, way, way, in the future,

115
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,611
I'm talkin' hovercrafts and
apes taking over the planet.

116
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,824
Come on, Chandler,
I want this part soo much.

117
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,455
Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.

118
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,622
Joey, no means no!

119
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,598
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.

120
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,137
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute

121
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,482
And you, uh, you,

122
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,443
- you I could eat with a spoon
- Get away from me I said no!

123
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,283
- Richard buzzed. He's waiting
downstairs. - Oh, Richard's here.

124
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,356
I should run down say bye to him

125
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,997
Bye.

126
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,871
So how's your date with
your cyberchick going.

127
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,467
Ooh, hey, what is all that?

128
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,175
Oh, it's a website, it's the,
uh, the Guggenheim museum.

129
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,606
See, she likes art,

130
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,110
and I like funny words.

131
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,683
What does she mean by HH?

132
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,213
It means we're holding hands.

133
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,557
Are you the cutest?

134
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,350
I'm afraid I might just be.

135
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:28,260
You know, what I think is so great
that you are totally into this person

136
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,903
and yet for all you know she could be
like 90 years old, or have two heads,

137
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:34,703
or. It could be a guy.

138
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,373
Okay, it's not a guy,
all right, I know her.

139
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,441
It could be like a big giant guy.

140
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:48,748
Man, I got this close to him
and Monica kneed me in the back.

141
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:51,150
What's going on?

142
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,887
We were just wondering if
Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.

143
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,394
Oh, well. Just ask her
how long she's gonna live.

144
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,053
Women live longer than men.

145
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,500
How do you not fall down more?

146
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,406
Okay, ask her 'What is her current
method of birth control? '

147
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:10,767
All right.

148
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,481
"My husband is sleeping
with his secretary."

149
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:19,815
She's married!

150
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:22,715
Well at least we know she's a woman.

151
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,315
I can't believe she's married.

152
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,359
Aw, man I'm sorry.

153
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,397
This must be very tough for ya, huh.

154
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:43,206
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that
says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings

155
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,667
because when pigeons
eat rice it kills them.

156
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,436
Oh, that's why you never
see pigeons at sushi bars.

157
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,377
- See, we're having fun.
- Oh, absolutely.

158
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,819
Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that
thing that we're not going to be thinking about.

159
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:58,681
Neither am I.

160
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,091
Hi, there. Are you all right?

161
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:06,892
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the
window that I crawled out of at my wedding,

162
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,500
and God, I just started thinking that I
shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't,

163
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,031
people are going to be looking at me and
judging me and, and thinking about the last time.

164
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,765
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay,
all right. It's a wedding

165
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,911
generally people focus on the bride.

166
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:21,742
God I know, you're right.

167
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,472
All rightie, everybody
look at me. Good.

168
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:28,744
All right, its time. Bridesmaids and
ushers let's see two lines, thank you.

169
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,582
Okay, I'll see you after the thing.

170
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,292
- Okay, good luck
- Thank you

171
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,787
Okay, Okay.

172
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,365
Why the hell didn't you tell me!

173
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:52,874
I'm sorry. What was
I supposed to do?

174
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,478
Stand up and shout 'Hey,
Rachel, your butt is showing!

175
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,779
Yeah, better than you
embarrass and I will go.

176
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,785
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating.

177
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,456
I think the only thing
that tops that was, was,

178
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,955
was when I was in the eight grade and I had to
sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school.

179
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,685
I think I got about two lines into
it before I ran and freaked out.

180
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,625
Oh my God, my entire life
is flashing before my eyes.

181
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,799
Rach, hey look, I remember
that, it wasn't so bad.

182
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:19,198
Oh Ross, would you stop,
you got me, I'm dating you.

183
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,301
Rachel!

184
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,276
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.

185
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,774
It's so wonderful to
see you again, my dear,

186
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,708
in fact I hardly
expected to see so much.

187
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,014
You told me you didn't see anything.

188
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,515
I tell ya a lot things!

189
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:40,451
Well it's wonderful to have
you up and about, again, dear.

190
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,790
Stay well.

191
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:47,496
Okay, now that is the third time someone
has said something like that to me today.

192
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,732
Rach! Rach!

193
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,002
- Oh my God, I'm married!
- I know.

194
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,570
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry
Hunter hyphen Farber.

195
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,775
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.

196
00:12:59,078 --> 00:12:59,510
Min.

197
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,503
Oh Rach, you're still here,

198
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,110
at our wedding, they were packing
up the chopped liver about now.

199
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,180
Yeah, I love that story.

200
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,388
Um, I got a question for you guys.

201
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,988
Why do people keep is saying
that is good to see me up and about?

202
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:18,055
Well uh, after you ran
out on your wedding,

203
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:22,358
Barry's parents told people
that you were sort of... insane.

204
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:24,595
Insane!

205
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,703
...from the syphilis.

206
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:27,639
What?!

207
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,206
Yeah, what are they gonna say
you didn't love me anymore. Come on.

208
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:37,181
Your choice was that, syphilis?

209
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:42,186
Hey, sweetie, at least they put
you Tutsi show under prospective.

210
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,517
Angela? Joey Tribiani.

211
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,920
Listen, what are ya doing tonight?

212
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,165
I know your seeing that guy, I was
thinking maybe you could bring him...

213
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,859
Hello? Hello?

214
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,483
Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like
the tenth bing-bong message she sent.

215
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,849
- She wants to know what's wrong?
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

216
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,487
You're married that's what's wrong.

217
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,223
- Oh, my.
- What?

218
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,158
She wants to meet you in person.

219
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,224
Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted
to meet her in person too

220
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,797
okay, but she's married,
she has a husband.

221
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:32,593
What if the husband person is the
wrong guy, and you are the right guy.

222
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,133
I mean you don't get chances
like this all the time,

223
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,673
if you don't meet her now,
you're gonna be kicking yourself

224
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,403
when your 80, which is hard to do,
and that's how you break a hip.

225
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,383
I don't know.

226
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:50,354
Listen, those bingbongs
are the woman who loves you.

227
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,755
Okay, I'll do it!

228
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,517
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great!

229
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:59,663
Go, man, go put on your shoes, and,
and march out there and meet her!

230
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:03,299
Oh, wait, no, no you have
to take a shower, 'cause, eww.

231
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:06,231
No, you know what you have
to answer her, answer her first.

232
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,939
No, no, you know what make
some coffee 'cause its too much.

233
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,477
Okay, one more, please. Come on,
I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.

234
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,206
Okay, last chance.

235
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,915
Again, I'm sorry.

236
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:35,031
You know what, maybe I
don't need to have children.

237
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,735
You know maybe I just think I
do because that is what society

238
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,397
and by that I mean my mom,

239
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,734
has always convinced me that I...

240
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:49,873
I do,

241
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,817
I have to have children,
I'm sorry. I just do.

242
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,254
Yo! Can I have your attention, please,

243
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,519
Best Man, making a toast here.

244
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:01,851
Thank you.

245
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:06,697
I remember when Barry got home
from his first date with Rachel...

246
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:10,767
What?!

247
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,736
What, you hired the same band
I can't use the same speech.

248
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,837
Thank you, thank you very much.

249
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:21,301
Anyway, I wish you both
a wonderful life together.

250
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,515
And Rachel...

251
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,817
- What.
- No, no, no now in all seriousness,

252
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,013
its not a lot of women would've had
the guts to come back here tonight

253
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,218
and even fewer, who would do it
with their asses hanging out!

254
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,593
Uh, I like to, uh, to
add something to that...

255
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,064
Why are you adding, why are you adding,
why are you adding, why are you adding?

256
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:51,174
Most of you don't know me,
I'm Rachel's boyfriend.

257
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:52,173
Oh dear God.

258
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:54,440
Ross,

259
00:16:55,014 --> 00:17:00,975
uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take
a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight.

260
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,183
And, uh, for the record

261
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,190
she did not run out on Barry
because she had syphilis.

262
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,595
What are you doing I'm serious.

263
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,766
Uh, the reason she walked out on, on
Barry is simply that she didn't love him

264
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,274
which incidentally worked
out pretty well for me

265
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:47,222
Rachel, took a lot of courage, doesn't
has the syphilis and wild with me.

266
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:49,757
Cheers!

267
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,466
- See you in the parking lot.
- No, Rach!

268
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,669
And once again she is out of here.

269
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,778
Okay who had 9:45? Um?

270
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,322
Ya, know what Barr,
I'm not gonna leave.

271
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,459
I probably should, but I'm not,

272
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:26,264
see 'cause I promised myself that I would
make it through at least *one* of your weddings.

273
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,675
See now, tonight, all
I really wanted was

274
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:38,145
to make it though this evening with
a little bit of grace and dignity.

275
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:42,642
Well, I guess we can all
agree that's not gonna happen.

276
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:51,558
There's nothing really
left to say except...

277
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:03,670
"Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl.

278
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:12,940
With yellow feathers, feathers in her
hair, and a dress cut down to there.

279
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,042
She would..."

280
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,313
- Marenge,
- "...marenge, thank you honey,

281
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,254
and do the cha-cha.

282
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,458
And while she like to be a star,
Tony always tended bar.

283
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,722
At the, wait, wait, everybody..."

284
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,357
Okay, I'll do it.

285
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:55,521
You'll do what?

286
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,591
If kids is what I takes to be
with you then kids it is.

287
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:00,829
Oh my God!

288
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,827
If I have to I'll, I'll do all again,

289
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,137
I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing,

290
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,230
I'll go to the P.T.A. Meetings,

291
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,173
I'll coach the soccer team.

292
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,339
- Really?
- Yeah, if I have to.

293
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:15,939
Monica,

294
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,344
I don't wanna lose you,

295
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:25,748
so if I have to do it all
over again, then I will.

296
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,859
You're the most wonderful man.

297
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:40,269
And if you hadn't of said
'if I have to' like seventeen times,

298
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,967
then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'

299
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:46,873
But you're not.

300
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:50,910
Oh my God,

301
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,914
I can't believe what
I'm getting ready to say.

302
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,448
I wanna have a baby,

303
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,723
but I don't wanna have one with someone
who doesn't really wanna have one.

304
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:11,865
God.

305
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:18,941
I love you.

306
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,407
I know you do.

307
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:29,646
Me too.

308
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:38,394
So what now?

309
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,226
I guess we just

310
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,025
keep dancing.

311
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:01,852
Where is she, Where is she?

312
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,955
Oh, hey, I have a
question, where is she?

313
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,052
Chandler, relax,
Chandler, she'll be here.

314
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:12,620
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.

315
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,461
Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.

316
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:20,368
Chandler, you gotta stop staring
at the door. It's like a watched pot,

317
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,832
you know if you keep looking at it
then the door is to, never gonna boil.

318
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:28,010
I think what you have
to do is try not to...

319
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,250
Oh my God!

320
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,759
OH... MY... GAWD!

321
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:56,438
OH... MY... GOD!

322
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,442
All right I've been feeling
incredibly guilty about this

323
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:13,147
because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a
good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes.

324
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:21,359
Wow, you are a good friend,

325
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,528
'course the audition was this
morning, and I didn't get it.

326
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,471
But that was a hell of a kiss.

327
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:30,798
Rachel is a very lucky girl.
