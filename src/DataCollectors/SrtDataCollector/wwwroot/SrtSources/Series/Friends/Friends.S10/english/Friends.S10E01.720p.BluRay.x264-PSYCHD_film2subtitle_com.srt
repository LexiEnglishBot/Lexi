1
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:08,674
Oh.

2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:14,263
The way you crushed Mike at Ping-Pong
was such a turn-on. You wanna?

3
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,558
You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.

4
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,811
- I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
- You're on.

5
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,647
- Hey.
- What's up?

6
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:27,901
Well, Mike's taking a shower, which,
by the way, there's no law against.

7
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,447
And, um, then we're gonna grab
some food. So if you want...

8
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,450
- Finally.
- Is that Ross?

9
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:37,953
Yeah. You can hear everything
through these stupid walls.

10
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,914
- Sounds like he's with someone.
- He could be alone.

11
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:44,543
This morning I heard him do pushups
and then talk to his triceps.

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,212
Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right.

13
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,340
Yeah, I hear someone else in there with him.

14
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,262
Oh.

15
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,890
- Dr. Geller!
- God, you're amazing.

16
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,892
I didn't even have to ask you
to call me that.

17
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:06,315
- Oh, my God, that's Charlie!
- She's cheating on Joey with Ross!

18
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:10,861
Oh, that tart! Floozy! Giant!

19
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,616
- I'm not sure about this.
- Yeah, you're right.

20
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,201
This is none of our business.

21
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:20,662
I'm not sure it's the best way
to hear everything. Get me a glass!

22
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:25,417
No, I'm not gonna do this, okay?
I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.

23
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,420
Ha, ha. I love Barbados.

24
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,512
- I can't believe I'm kissing you.
- Ha, ha.

25
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,056
- I'm kissing Rachel!
- Ha, ha.

26
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,767
- I know. I'm her. Ha, ha.
- Oh!

27
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,771
Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!

28
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,773
- What?
- Get over here!

29
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,487
- Oh.
- Whoa!

30
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,615
Oh, my God! I love how thin these walls are!

31
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,876
Thank you.

32
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:03,473
Hey, before, you said that nothing could
happen between us. What changed?

33
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,351
- Well, I only said that because of Ross.
- Mm.

34
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,396
- And then I saw him kissing Charlie.
- What?

35
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,565
Ross and Charlie?

36
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:15,944
Wow! She's really making her way
through the group, huh?

37
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,407
- Ah, who am I to talk? Ha, ha.
- Yeah.

38
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,287
I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?

39
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,540
How about the dinosaur twins
in the other room?

40
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,461
- No one is manning that wall!
- I'm on it!

41
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,174
- Anything?
- I think I hear curtains closing.

42
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,427
We've got shoes being kicked off
over here.

43
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,889
Bedsprings! Unmistakable!

44
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,684
- You realize that's your brother.
- Not until you said it. Somebody switch!

45
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,189
Wow! Wait a minute.

46
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,150
Ross and Charlie. Joey and Rachel.

47
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,946
Phoebe and Mike. We're the only ones
leaving with the person we came with!

48
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:03,033
That's not true. I came with Monica,
I'm leaving with Weird Al.

49
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,245
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes.

50
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,414
- Tomorrow I'm going to the salon.
- Okay, Buckwheat.

51
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,712
You gotta hear this, it's great!
It's like free porn.

52
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,971
Um...

53
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:28,100
- Is everything okay?
- It's just... I don't think I can do this.

54
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,644
Oh, is it because of what might
be on the bed?

55
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,189
- I saw that report, with the infrared...
- No! No.

56
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,525
No, uh...

57
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:41,113
Look, I need to talk to Joey.
I mean, you guys just broke up.

58
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:45,158
Before anything more happens between us,
I need to know he's okay with it.

59
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:49,538
- I, uh, completely understand.
- All right, I'm gonna go find him.

60
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,627
I just need a second before I can,
you know...

61
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,469
Grandma, Grandma, Grandma.

62
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,312
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Okay!

63
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,857
That's the door. He's gone.

64
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,027
And she's turning on the TV...

65
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:24,990
...and watching Miss Congeniality.

66
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:29,661
Honey? If you know it through a wall,
you know it too well.

67
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,921
Hey, what are you guys doing?

68
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:47,054
Oh, we're just... We're sad to go,
so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel.

69
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,930
I love you...

70
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:54,561
...Paradise Hotel Golf Resort and Spa.

71
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,858
Yeah. We had a great time, thank you.

72
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,030
Bye.

73
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,826
Okay. Um, hey, have you guys
seen Joey anywhere?

74
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,038
He's probably in his room
with his current girlfriend, Charlie.

75
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,874
That's the situation as we know it.

76
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,171
If you see him, could you tell him
I'm looking for him?

77
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,590
- You got it.
- Thanks.

78
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,261
Thank you.

79
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,352
Other wall, people! Other wall!

80
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,901
- Rach, you there?
- Oh, my God, that's Ross!

81
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,195
- What are we gonna do?
- Okay, just be calm.

82
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,531
For all he knows,
we're just hanging out.

83
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,117
All right? So just be nonchalant.

84
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,042
- That's not nonchalant!
- No idea what it means.

85
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,337
Okay, just hide.

86
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,008
- Rach?
- Coming! Try under the bed.

87
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,431
There's no room under the bed...

88
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:18,186
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

89
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,321
- Hey. Do you know where Joey is?
- Hi.

90
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,866
I really don't.

91
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,122
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah. Sure.

92
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,584
I don't believe this.

93
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,921
- Have you guys been...?
- Shh! This is the listening side of the wall.

94
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,513
Then she told me
that she and Joey had broken up...

95
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,849
...and part of the reason
was she had feelings for me.

96
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,809
Uh-huh, right. Yeah.

97
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,062
You know I've wanted to ask Charlie out
since the day I met her.

98
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,774
Oh, I know, I know.
That's been really hard for you.

99
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,444
Anyway, one thing led to another, and...

100
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,363
...oh, before you know it, we were kissing.

101
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,866
How angry do you think Joey's gonna be?

102
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,870
That is hard to say, Ross.
That is hard to say.

103
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,165
I gotta find him.
He's gotta be here someplace.

104
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,875
You would think.

105
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,423
Joey?

106
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:32,093
- Is he gone?
- How are you doing this?

107
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,638
Psst!

108
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,348
What? Hey!

109
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,935
What are you...? What is this?
Have you been listening this entire time?

110
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,937
Yeah!

111
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,147
Now, what is this?

112
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,526
What is this? Well, let's see.
We kissed for 10 minutes...

113
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:52,113
...and now we're talking to our friends
about it, so I guess this is sixth grade.

114
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,742
No, no. Have you thought about
how complicated this could get?

115
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,161
- What about Ross?
- Well, he's with Charlie now.

116
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,915
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you
before anything really happens with her.

117
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,919
And as his friend, I mean, don't you think
he deserves the same from you?

118
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,925
You're a pain in my ass, Geller.

119
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,555
Look, we appreciate all the advice...

120
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,224
...but this is between Joey and me.
We can handle it.

121
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,811
We'll go. Will you do one thing for us,
the people that care about you?

122
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,938
- Sure.
- Enunciate.

123
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,357
Get out!

124
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,365
Are they right?

125
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:40,412
Probably, yeah. I mean, maybe we should...

126
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,455
...hold off until we talk to Ross.

127
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,502
Yeah. Yeah. We can wait.
We don't have to do anything tonight.

128
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,296
Yeah, I think that would be best.

129
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,216
So, I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off.

130
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,553
- Although...
- I like "although."

131
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,556
- Uh...
- I mean, you know...

132
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:03,101
Ross and I haven't dated in, like...

133
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,061
...six years.

134
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,105
Six years?

135
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:11,026
Wow. That's almost as long as high school.

136
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,783
Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.

137
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,493
Absolutely.

138
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,246
- He's not thinking about you.
- No.

139
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,583
I'm thinking about you.

140
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,835
Yeah.

141
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:34,966
- Let's forget about Ross.
- It's forgotten.

142
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,762
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

143
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,097
Seriously, what is it?

144
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:46,019
Nothing. It's really... It's nothing.
Come here. Come here.

145
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,147
What's wrong?

146
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,776
Ah. Sorry, I just, um...

147
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,653
I can't seem to get Ross out of my head.

148
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,408
Well, maybe I can help.

149
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,417
Your lips are so soft. Do that again.

150
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,256
- Yeah, we need to talk to Ross. Yeah.
- Yeah.

151
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,139
- Hey. You guys ready to go?
- Hey.

152
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,184
Not quite. Monica's at the salon,
and I'm finishing packing.

153
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,729
Dude, you're not taking your Bible?

154
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,440
You're not supposed to take that.

155
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,527
Besides, it's a New Testament.
What are you gonna do with it?

156
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,612
Learn about Jesus.

157
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,742
- Hey!
- So did you talk to Joey?

158
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,288
Uh, no. I couldn't find him.
I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.

159
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:51,251
Okay. Sounds like a good idea,
Dr. Geller.

160
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,878
Stop it.

161
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,589
Ph.D.

162
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,051
You're filthy.

163
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,137
Hey. Have you guys seen Monica?

164
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,389
Uh, actually, I think she went to the salon.

165
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,933
Oh, yeah.
Oh, she went to the salon, all right.

166
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,561
Check it out!

167
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,356
Whose day just got better?

168
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,109
Chandler!

169
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,988
Hey! Aah.

170
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,450
- What do you think?
- I think...

171
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:26,327
- I think I can see your scalp.
- Ha, ha.

172
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,413
Don't you just love it?

173
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,875
Yeah. Yeah, you got shellfish
in your head.

174
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,546
It's, uh, something. You go, girlfriend.

175
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,341
- You never said that in your life.
- Not once.

176
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,634
I thought so.

177
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,553
Oh, and listen to this.

178
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:52,020
What do you know?
It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.

179
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,200
Ooh.

180
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:10,079
Wow, it's, uh, kind of weird that I'm
sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.

181
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:14,083
Yeah. It's almost as if Air Barbados
doesn't care about your social life.

182
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,420
Does someone mind switching
and sitting with Charlie?

183
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,591
Oh, I mean, I... Dude, I spent
the whole conference with Charlie.

184
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,259
- I understand.
- No, I'll do it.

185
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:28,515
Wish I could switch. I really don't want
to sit with Allen lverson over there.

186
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,774
Um, once we're in the air
and the captain turns off the seat belt sign...

187
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:41,027
...you feel free to roam about my cabin.

188
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:46,574
And you should be careful
when checking your overhead bins.

189
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:50,119
- Because items may shift during...
- Oh, you're not good at this.

190
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,043
- Do you have to go home tonight?
- No, I think I could come over.

191
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,587
- It's Saturday, right?
- Oh.

192
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,130
What?

193
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,968
- Um, I can't do anything tonight.
- Why not?

194
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,513
- I have a date.
- Wh...?

195
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:14,227
- You have a date? With who?
- Oh, it's my girlfriend.

196
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,189
- You have a girlfriend?
- Yeah.

197
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,234
Well, when you and I broke up,
I started seeing someone.

198
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,987
- Well, for how long?
- Three months.

199
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,822
Three months?

200
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,408
Okay.

201
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:33,454
This is none of my business, but, um,
how long are you gonna keep seeing her?

202
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,833
I'll tell her that it's over
tonight at dinner. I promise.

203
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,586
Oh, okay, good. You do that.

204
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:45,008
When you get home, maybe there'll be
a special delivery package waiting for you.

205
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,137
Maybe I'll sign for it, tear it open.

206
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:55,184
- Pull out the packing material...
- We'll have sex. Let's leave it there.

207
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,361
All right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey.
I think this is the right time.

208
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,781
He's in a good mood after
the flight attendant says "duty-free."

209
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,367
Okay. Good luck.

210
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,416
Ross is coming over. I think now
would be a good time to talk to him.

211
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,794
Oh, I guess so. I'm just... I'm really nervous.

212
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,380
Well, keep in mind
that by the time you're done...

213
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,132
...they'll probably be serving dinner.

214
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,134
Ooh.

215
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,262
Still nervous?

216
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,474
I'm gonna get the lasagna.

217
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,809
- Hey, Rach, uh...
- Yeah?

218
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:40,480
- Do you mind if I sit here for a sec?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

219
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,607
Good luck.

220
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,113
- Hey. Ha.
- Hey.

221
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,658
So I, um...

222
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,369
I kind of need to talk to you about Charlie.

223
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:58,539
- Yeah?
- Last night, after you guys broke up...

224
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:02,377
- So sorry to hear about that, by the way.
- Hmm, yeah.

225
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:07,799
Well, Charlie and I were talking, and...

226
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,635
Well...

227
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,304
- You kissed.
- Wh...?

228
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,141
What? Ha, ha.

229
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,311
What? Ha, ha.
What would give you that idea?

230
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,189
- I saw you.
- Yeah, we kissed.

231
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:28,569
But nothing else.
Nothing else happened, okay?

232
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,864
- Ross, Ross, Ross. It's okay.
- What?

233
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,575
It's okay. You know, look...

234
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,870
...I totally understand, all right? You guys...

235
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:42,834
...make way more sense than her
and I ever did, you know? And...

236
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,212
- I want you to be happy.
- Are you serious?

237
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,922
Yeah.

238
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:53,928
- Now I have something...
- I am speechless.

239
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:59,934
I mean, the fact that you would put
my happiness first like that, I mean...

240
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,978
You're an incredible friend,
do you know that?

241
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,440
- Oh, well, look, before you go...
- No, I mean it.

242
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:12,321
I mean, you're so loyal, man.
And selfless and generous.

243
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,949
I am those things, yeah.

244
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:21,914
I've known Chandler longer, so I think
of him as my best friend. But now...

245
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,626
...I may have to rethink some stuff.

246
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,336
Dude!

247
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,841
Hey, if there is ever anything
I can do for you...

248
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,887
I can't think of anything. Ha, ha.

249
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,683
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

250
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,230
- So hi.
- Hi.

251
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:50,735
- So, you, uh, talked to Joey?
- Oh, yeah. We had a really good talk.

252
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,403
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

253
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,907
- Oh. So everything's okay? Oh.
- Oh, no, it's great.

254
00:17:56,075 --> 00:18:01,579
- It's great. He's an amazing guy.
- Oh, well, obviously, I think so too.

255
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,874
Well, I'm so excited about this.

256
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,212
Really? Ha, ha. Excited?

257
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:14,926
What, are you kidding? I have had
some very dirty dreams about this.

258
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,306
Excuse me.

259
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,523
You didn't tell him, did you?

260
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,943
I couldn't. He was saying all these
really nice things about me.

261
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,403
I didn't want him to get mad
and take them back.

262
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,864
- I'm gonna edge out Chandler!
- Oh, God.

263
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,451
Fine. Forget it. When we go back
to New York, I will tell him.

264
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,453
Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.

265
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,725
- Hi, Mike's place.
- Hey, it's Mike.

266
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:05,977
Ooh, that was fast.

267
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,645
Oh, uh, no, she's not here yet.

268
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,191
You know, I'm just gonna take off
and break up with her over the phone.

269
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,945
You can't do that. Oh, come on, Mike,
strap on a pair.

270
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:22,743
Why don't you tell her that we got back
together. Women appreciate honesty.

271
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:28,166
We also appreciate gentle spanking
once in a while, just FYI.

272
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:33,963
One more thing. There might be a picture
of Precious on my coffee table.

273
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,507
Her name's Precious?

274
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,927
Is she a pure breed, or did you
pick her up at the pound? Ha, ha.

275
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,389
I just want to give you a heads-up.

276
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,974
Okay. And if she gets upset...

277
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,268
...just scratch her tummy
and give her a liver snap.

278
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,488
Hi. I'm Precious. Who are you?

279
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,159
- I'm... I'm Phoebe.
- Phoebe?

280
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:07,371
Mike's ex-girlfriend, Phoebe?
The love of his life? That Phoebe?

281
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:16,380
Oh, I can't wait for everyone
at work to see these!

282
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,507
Ow!

283
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,427
- You go back to work tomorrow night?
- Yeah.

284
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,596
So if you want people to see them...

285
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,766
...you're not having them taken out,
say, at the break of dawn?

286
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:31,020
Well, if I had them taken out,
then I wouldn't be able to do this.

287
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,273
Mm.

288
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,359
Aah! Aah!

289
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,987
You like that, right?

290
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,289
- What are you singing?
- It's "Bolero" from 10.

291
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,376
It's "Ride of the Valkyries"
from Apocalypse Now.

292
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:58,381
Here's the thing. The cornrows were
a solution to your frizzy-hair problem.

293
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:02,176
Now that we're home, you don't have
that problem. If you think about it...

294
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,178
I hate them.

295
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:09,058
- What? You said you liked them.
- Did I? Let's refresh.

296
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,395
I believe what I said was
that I could see your scalp.

297
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,565
Well, fine. So you don't like them.
Everybody else does.

298
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:20,027
Again, let's journey back.

299
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:24,991
As I recall, Rachel said she had never
noticed the shape of your skull before.

300
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:29,704
And Joey? Well, Joey didn't realize
there was anything different.

301
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:34,125
You know what? I don't care.
I like it, and I'm gonna keep it.

302
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:37,670
You're just jealous
because your hair can't do this.

303
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,172
Ow!

304
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,259
- Get yourself in the tooth?
- And the eye.

305
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:58,482
Hi! There she is! Hi, Emma.
Oh, my God, I missed you.

306
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,736
Oh, Emma, I missed you so much. Hi.

307
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,739
Did you have a good time
with Grandma Green? Huh?

308
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:08,993
Did she give you a bottle of
antidepressants again to use as a rattle?

309
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,873
That was one time, Ross,
and they were only, like, five milligrams.

310
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,377
Ooh, hey, Emma, Daddy has some
presents for you, okay?

311
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,379
I want you to wait right here.

312
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,298
- Come here, sweetie.
- Oh.

313
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,843
Ross, um, actually,
there's something that, uh...

314
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,762
...I really need to talk to you about.

315
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,597
Okay, shoot.

316
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,683
Okay. Um, all right, here's the deal.

317
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,603
Ah! Oh, no!

318
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:41,567
- What is it?
- Oh, major shampoo explosion!

319
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:47,239
- Uh, look, Ross, this really isn't easy.
- Oh, it's all over everything!

320
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,161
Why? Why me?

321
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:56,123
Because you took 300 bottles of shampoo?

322
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,919
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You were saying?

323
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,379
Well, yeah, uh...

324
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:05,508
- Look, it's about me and...
- Oh, not another one!

325
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:11,722
Oh, my God... Oh, and this is moisturizer!
It's even harder to clean!

326
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,977
Why? Why do bad things happen
to good people?

327
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:23,484
- Wow. Clearly this is not a good time.
- Uh, you think?

328
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,323
Okay. Bye.

329
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,743
All right, so Mike's on his way over.

330
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,956
You thought you were meeting here,
he thought at the restaurant, so...

331
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:41,419
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.
The point is, I'm gonna take off.

332
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:46,507
Wait. I'm not letting you leave until
you tell me what's going on. I mean...

333
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,135
...are you guys getting back together
or something?

334
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,221
All right.

335
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,059
Susie... Can I call you Susie?

336
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,603
My name is Precious.

337
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,523
I can't say that.

338
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,944
Um, Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you.

339
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:11,365
Mike and I are back together.
And, um, unfortunately...

340
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:15,244
...that effectively ends
your relationship with him.

341
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:22,084
He's very sorry about that, and wishes you
the best of luck in all your endeavors.

342
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,755
I just can't believe this. Why?

343
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,008
- Well, I don't...
- Why would he do this?

344
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,927
- What's wrong with me?
- There's nothing wrong with you.

345
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,180
What the hell am I supposed to do now?

346
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:37,600
Damn it, woman! Pull yourself together!

347
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,853
Have some pride, for the love of God!

348
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:48,360
Okay, not a fan of the tough love.

349
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,406
I just can't believe that Mike
didn't give me any warning.

350
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:57,620
He didn't know. He wasn't planning on
coming to Barbados and proposing to me.

351
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:02,458
He proposed to you?
This is the worst birthday ever!

352
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,257
Look, Precious...

353
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:16,305
Mike's not worth this.
You're an attractive, intelligent woman...

354
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,974
...and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang.

355
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,187
He proposed to me
while he was still seeing you.

356
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:26,106
He was gonna break up with you
on your birthday?

357
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:31,070
I don't like to kiss and tell,
but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.

358
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,532
Oh, my God, you know, maybe you're right.
Maybe I don't need him.

359
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,701
I deserve to be treated with respect.

360
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:43,999
Screw you, Mike. You're a coward
and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell!

361
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,340
You're welcome.

362
00:25:56,471 --> 00:26:00,516
Honey? You've been in there
for a long time. Is everything okay?

363
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,601
Not really.

364
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,897
I have a problem.

365
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,609
Really? What happened?

366
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:16,323
Well, I was dancing around
and singing "No Woman, No Cry"...

367
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,452
...and, um, I got stuck.

368
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:24,456
- You can't move at all?
- Oh, I can move. Ha, ha.

369
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,507
If I untangle you, will you please
get rid of the cornrows?

370
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,676
I guess so.

371
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,974
- Some of these look a little frayed.
- Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.

372
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,396
- Hey.
- Hi.

373
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:51,108
- So? Did you, uh, tell Ross?
- Well, I tried...

374
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,819
...but then he had
a shampoo-related emergency.

375
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,698
- So I guess now it's your turn again.
- No, no, no, no.

376
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:01,368
I think it's better if you tell him.
You know, it's easier for a woman.

377
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,622
That way, you know, if he gets mad,
all you have to do is go:

378
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,498
"I didn't mean it.

379
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,545
I'm so sorry."

380
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,133
Yeah, because that's what we do.

381
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:20,220
All right, all right, okay. Um, how about this?
How about this? Tomorrow...

382
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,805
Mm-hm?

383
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,476
Tomorrow we'll both go
and we'll tell him together.

384
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,353
Okay, that sounds fair.

385
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:30,314
- That just means, once again, we can't...
- I know.

386
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:34,360
That's okay. I mean, we can
control ourselves. We're not animals.

387
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:38,572
- No! Pfft. Of course, we can wait.
- Yeah.

388
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,575
All right, so I guess
that means good night then.

389
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,078
Yep. Good night.

390
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,704
Oh.

391
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:56,215
Good night.

392
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,473
- Good night.
- Stop saying good night.

393
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,683
Okay.

394
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:29,289
I'm so sorry.

395
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,298
Look what I found in the drawer.

396
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,429
And you said I'd never wear this.

397
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:47,933
Now that I untangled you,
how about you do a little something for me?

398
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:51,937
- Sure. What did you have in mind?
- I think you know.

399
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:57,276
- Really? I don't... I don't really feel like it.
- This is what I want to do.

400
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,820
Okay.

401
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,281
I just don't get why you like it so much.

402
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:07,745
She's an FBI agent posing
as a beauty contestant!
