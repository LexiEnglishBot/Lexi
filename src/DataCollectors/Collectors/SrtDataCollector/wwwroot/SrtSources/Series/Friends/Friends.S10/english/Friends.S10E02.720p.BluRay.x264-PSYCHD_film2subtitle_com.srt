1
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,598
Uh, okay, Ross.

2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,436
I realize that you didn't expect
to walk in and see that, but, uh...

3
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:24,148
- Let me explain, okay?
- We weren't doing anything!

4
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,649
Rach, he just saw us.

5
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,444
Shh.

6
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:33,824
Uh, but what you saw,
that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.

7
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,661
- That's a lie! We also kissed in Barbados.
- Dude, chill!

8
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,957
Okay, we also kissed in Barbados...

9
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,960
...but we didn't plan it.
The only reason that happened...

10
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,004
...was because I saw you kiss Charlie.

11
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:51,467
Yeah, you started it!
I have got to chill.

12
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:57,765
Look, we probably should have talked to
you about this before it ever happened.

13
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:01,393
- But...
- Oh, we feel so terrible about this, Ross.

14
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,813
Yeah. But it did happen.

15
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,815
So...

16
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:22,706
Ross?

17
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,962
Can we just close the door?

18
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,086
Ross, say something.

19
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,754
Anything.

20
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,383
So you two are?

21
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,969
Yeah.

22
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,139
And have you had?

23
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:23,350
- No. No, no, no.
- No. No.

24
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,853
But if I hadn't walked in here,
would you?

25
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,980
Probably...
No. No.

26
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,318
Ross, this is not how we wanted you
to find out about this.

27
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,445
You have every right
to go nuts.

28
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,865
I'm not going nuts.
Do you see me going nuts?

29
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,992
No, but you know what I mean.

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,201
Hey, hey, hey.

31
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,999
If you two are happy...

32
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,377
...then I'm happy for you.

33
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,380
I'm fine.

34
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,842
- Really?
- Absolutely.

35
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,386
I'm fine.

36
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,305
Totally fine.

37
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,933
Heh. I don't know why it's coming out
all loud and squeaky...

38
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,143
...because, really...

39
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,395
...I'm fine.

40
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,650
I'm not saying
I wasn't a little surprised...

41
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,695
...heh, to see you guys kissing.

42
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,322
I mean, at first I was like:

43
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,996
But now that I've had time
to absorb it...

44
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,916
Loving this.

45
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:34,171
- Ross...
- It's all working out.

46
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,966
Me and Charlie.
And you two.

47
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,261
- You know what we should do?
- Calm ourselves?

48
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,347
No.

49
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,641
We should all have dinner.

50
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,976
Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night.
I'll cook!

51
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:51,772
Wow. Uh, look, don't you think
that would be a little weird?

52
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,107
Weird? What? What's weird? Huh?

53
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:57,361
The only thing weird would be
if someone didn't like Mexican food...

54
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,571
...because I'm making fajitas!

55
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,289
I do like fajitas.

56
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,503
God, this adoption stuff
is so overwhelming.

57
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:18,215
There's inter-country adoption,
dependency adoption.

58
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:22,302
There's so many ways to go, and this is,
like, the biggest decision of our lives.

59
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,096
There's a hair in my coffee.

60
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,724
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

61
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,936
Have you seen Frank Jr?
He's meeting me here with the triplets.

62
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,188
It's funny,
every time you say "triplets"...

63
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,816
...I think of three hot,
blond 19-year-olds.

64
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,402
Oh, that's sweet.

65
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,570
Drink your hair.

66
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,864
Hey, what's all this stuff?

67
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,701
Oh, they're brochures
from different adoption agencies.

68
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,287
Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute.

69
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,289
Get this one.

70
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,833
That's not really how it works.

71
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,794
- Oh, how does it work?
- I don't know!

72
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,007
If you're having a hard time,
you should talk to my friends...

73
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:03,176
...Bill and Colleen. They adopted
a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.

74
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,178
- Thanks, that would be great.
- Sure.

75
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,763
Hey, honey,
wouldn't that be great?

76
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,229
All right, all right.
Remember what we talked about.

77
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,648
When we're in a public place,
there are certain rules.

78
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,610
That's not what we talked about!

79
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,863
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi.

80
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,366
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

81
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,994
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi. Hey, how you doing?

82
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:33,081
Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten
so big. Which one is which again?

83
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,209
Oh, well, uh, uh,
that's, uh, Frank Jr. Jr...

84
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:39,338
...pulling the tampons out
of the lady's purse.

85
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:43,800
And, uh, that's, uh, Chandler
climbing on Chandler.

86
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,263
And, uh, that's Leslie
throwing bagels at him.

87
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,059
"Willing to adopt triplets?" No.

88
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:59,066
Oh, can I just say, I know we're doing
this for Ross and that's cool.

89
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:02,736
But if it was up to me, this is not what
we'd be doing on our first date.

90
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,280
Well, what would we be doing?

91
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,366
I'd take you out
for a romantic night.

92
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:12,579
Some champagne, fancy dinner,
feel you up on the carriage ride home.

93
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,207
Feel me up?

94
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,209
In a carriage.

95
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,004
- Hey, Charlie!
- Hi.

96
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,964
- Hi.
- Hey. Hmm.

97
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,383
So...

98
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,051
...dreading this?
- Oh, you bet.

99
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,761
- Mm.
Mm-hm.

100
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,347
So did you, uh,
bring a little something for Ross?

101
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:34,142
Actually, uh, it's some stuff you left
at my apartment.

102
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,062
Oh, well, thanks.

103
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,731
And you can just give me
my stuff whenever you want.

104
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,651
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.
Heh, heh.

105
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:50,117
Ah, I thought I heard voices.
What? Ha, ha.

106
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,035
Hi, Charlie. Mwah.

107
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,746
- Hey, Joey. Ha.
- Hey.

108
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:59,000
And, uh, oh, you're gonna have
to introduce me to your new girlfriend.

109
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,758
I'm just kidding. I know Rachel.
I know... Uh...

110
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,719
Come. Please come in.
Come in.

111
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,097
Okay.
Uh, well, we brought you some wine.

112
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,934
Oh. Ah. That is so thoughtful.

113
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,311
She's a keeper. Ha.

114
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,566
- And what did you bring me, huh?
- Uh, actually, that's, uh...

115
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,776
Underwear, a toothbrush...

116
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,070
...and a Van Halen CD.

117
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,865
I can use all these things!

118
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,577
Gosh, Ross, you know,
you seem a little, um...

119
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,121
What? Fine? Because I am, huh?

120
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,623
Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't...?
You see?

121
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,917
Who else is fine?

122
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,878
- Ha, ha.
- Come on.

123
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,173
Listen. Why don't you, uh, try to relax.
Maybe have a drink.

124
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,216
You know what,
that is a very good idea.

125
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,011
I'm gonna go make
a pitcher of margaritas.

126
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,310
Oh, God.

127
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,270
So adorable.

128
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,398
Look at them,
sleeping there like angels.

129
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:07,152
- Yeah, I really cherish these moments...
- Mm.

130
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,988
...because, uh, before you know it,
they're gonna be awake again.

131
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,534
Well, they may be a handful...

132
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,703
...but they're so cute.
- Yeah.

133
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,582
Oh, God, last time I babysat them,
they did the funniest thing. Ha, ha.

134
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,877
I haven't slept in four years.

135
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,923
That's a long time.

136
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,383
You just don't know
how hard it is, Phoebe.

137
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,385
There's just so many of them.

138
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,221
You know, two I could handle.

139
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,932
Two's great.
You just hold one in each hand.

140
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,477
What do I do when the third one runs
at me with his bike helmet on?

141
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,480
I got no more hands
to protect my area.

142
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,650
There's three of them, Phoebe.
Three.

143
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,901
Yeah, I know, Frank.

144
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,363
I counted them when they
were coming out of my area.

145
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,742
Sometimes, I think that, uh...

146
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:00,539
Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it.
It's too horrible. No.

147
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,375
What?

148
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,877
No, no, I can't.

149
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,465
Oh, my God, Frank.
Are you thinking of leaving?

150
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,802
Because I didn't have those triplets
so you could run out on them.

151
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,847
Oh, no, I would never do that.
No. I just...

152
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:22,143
...was thinking that, you know,
maybe you could take one.

153
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,979
What?

154
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:28,567
You can't separate them, that's terrible!
Which one?

155
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,990
Thank you so much for seeing us.

156
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,158
Phoebe has told us great things
about you guys.

157
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,202
Oh, please, we're happy to help.

158
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,997
We went through the same thing
when we were adopting.

159
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:46,293
So a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees
and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?

160
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,968
I mean, you have a lovely home.

161
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,387
We appreciate anything
you can tell us.

162
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:01,016
Well, actually,
I think this might help.

163
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,267
It's pretty much...

164
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,269
...all the information you need.
- Oh, my God.

165
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,647
Everything is broken into categories,
then cross-referenced.

166
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,650
Then color-coded to correspond
with the forms in the back.

167
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,901
Thank you.

168
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,446
I think I just had a tiny orgasm.

169
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,037
I know the process is frustrating,
but it's so worth it.

170
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,290
Adopting Owen was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

171
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,751
That's great. Can I see the book?

172
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,005
You want me to wash
my hands first, don't you?

173
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:35,258
Please. It's just so pretty and white.

174
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,553
Bathroom is down the hall to your left.

175
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,348
I would have told him to do it too.

176
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,599
Can I adopt you?

177
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,104
- Hey, you must be Owen.
- Yeah.

178
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,815
I'm Chandler.
Hey, I was in the Scouts too.

179
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,527
- You were?
- In fact, my father was a den mother.

180
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:58,281
- Huh?
- You know how to use a compass?

181
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,033
I have a badge in it.

182
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,452
- You do? That's fantastic.
- You want to see it?

183
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,996
I'd love to, but I gotta get back
to your parents.

184
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,457
They're telling us
about how they adopted you.

185
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,250
What?

186
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,841
What?!

187
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,428
I'm adopted?

188
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,807
I got nothing.

189
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,942
Well, that first batch of
margaritas was not so great...

190
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,570
...but this second batch is good.

191
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,534
Well, maybe the next batch,
we could all get some.

192
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,078
Oh, God, this is fun, isn't it?

193
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,539
You know, just the four of us.

194
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,874
Just hanging. Ha.

195
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,668
Dude, are you okay?

196
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,753
And when are the fajitas
gonna be ready?

197
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,299
I'm fine, okay? I'm great.

198
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,428
I'm just...
I'm just proud of us.

199
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:05,056
You know?
There's no weirdness, no tension.

200
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,267
No awareness.

201
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,354
We make a great foursome.
We should do more stuff together.

202
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,232
You know, oh, let's take a trip!

203
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,445
Okay, where do you think we can go?

204
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,614
My fajitas!

205
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,078
Look, Charlie,
I just want you to know...

206
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:31,374
...Ross is just having a little trouble
adjusting to the thought of Joey and me.

207
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,209
He normally doesn't drink like this.

208
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:37,255
Oh, you know what, this is nothing.
My father is a raging alcoholic.

209
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,678
Oh, I'm sorry, have I made
this evening uncomfortable?

210
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:50,185
Fajitas! Be careful!
Very hot plate! Very hot!

211
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,395
Ross, you don't
even have oven mitts on.

212
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,735
That is gonna hurt tomorrow.

213
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,239
Okay, well, this is crazy.

214
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,910
We can't seriously be talking about me
taking one of your kids, can we?

215
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,703
Oh, no, of course we're not.

216
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,497
- That's insane.
- I know.

217
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,165
Alice would never go for it.

218
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,585
She's pretty tired too.
I think we could get her on board.

219
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:21,549
Well, just for argument's sake,
you know, hypothetically...

220
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,885
...which one
would you be willing to give up?

221
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,845
Huh.

222
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,347
Frank Jr. Jr?

223
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,225
You'd be getting a really good one.

224
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:33,186
I mean, you know,
he's really funny.

225
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,981
Like, the other day,
he made up this joke:

226
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,401
What's green and says,
"Hey, I'm a frog"?

227
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,154
A talking frog.

228
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,994
Oh, no, you can't have him,
he's too funny. Ha, ha.

229
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,497
Well, all right, that's fine.
What about, um, Leslie?

230
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,458
Oh, no, no, not Leslie. No.

231
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:59,504
She's the only one that knows how
to burp the alphabet.

232
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,423
All right, so that leaves Chandler.

233
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,802
Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler.
No, no. She's my little genius.

234
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,470
I got big hopes for her.

235
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:12,267
She's gonna be a doctor
or a realtor.

236
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,897
Wow, Frank. Ha.
I think we just ran out of kids.

237
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,150
Oh, I think you're right.

238
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:28,783
Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think
I can give one of them up.

239
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,704
I mean, you know, they drive me crazy,
but they're my babies.

240
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,501
I'm sorry, Frank,
I didn't realize things were so bad.

241
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,921
You know, I'll help out more.
I can babysit anytime you want.

242
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,756
You name the day and I'll be there.

243
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,301
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, that's not good.

244
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,179
But I can move some stuff around
and I'll be there.

245
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,807
You and Alice just take
the whole day together.

246
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,018
Tsk. You'd do that for us?

247
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,478
Are you kidding?
That's what sisters are for.

248
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,773
Tsk. Oh.

249
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,987
Oh, look at them.

250
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,782
Oh. I love you so much.

251
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,494
Oh, crap, don't wake up!
Don't wake up!

252
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,542
- Where are Bill and Colleen?
- Kitchen, getting something to eat.

253
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,795
- Can you believe how nice they are?
- We have to leave.

254
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,300
Why?
What did you do in the bathroom?

255
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,386
I didn't get to the bathroom.
I bumped into Owen on the way.

256
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:33,264
He didn't know he was adopted.
There's a slight chance...

257
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,766
...I may have told him.

258
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:38,436
Oh, my God, where's my purse?
No, I can replace everything in there.

259
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,606
- Get that binder and let's go!
- Hi. Ha.

260
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,733
Some little snacks for everybody.

261
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,277
You don't have to eat the sour worms.
Those are for Owen.

262
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,030
I'll get him in a second.

263
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,533
Uh, by the way, you should know,
we haven't told him he's adopted yet.

264
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,411
But kids are so intuitive.

265
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,914
Don't you think, on some level,
he already knows?

266
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,459
- I'm adopted?
- See? Intuitive.

267
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,045
What? Where did you hear that?

268
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,338
He told me.

269
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:10,510
And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.

270
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,721
Which, technically,
now you should give back.

271
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,643
You told him he's adopted?

272
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,562
I'm sorry. You should have
a sign out there or something.

273
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,857
Or at least whisper it to people
when they come in the door.

274
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,859
"Owen doesn't know he's adopted...

275
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,569
...and he also thinks Santa is real."

276
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,488
He isn't?

277
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,033
We have to get out of here, baby.

278
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,665
Everyone, I would like
to make a toast...

279
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,793
...to Rachel and Joey.

280
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,798
And to love.

281
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,885
Ah, love!

282
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,762
Mm.

283
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,306
L-O-V-E. Love.

284
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,600
I is for "life."

285
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,353
And what is life without love?

286
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,939
Oh, my God, are we supposed
to answer?

287
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,737
O is for:

288
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,823
"Oh, wow!"

289
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,371
The V is for this...

290
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,542
...very surprising turn of events...

291
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:28,421
...which I am still fine with,
by the way.

292
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,300
E...

293
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,888
...is for how...

294
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:41,017
...extremely normal I find it...

295
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,311
...that you two...

296
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,772
...are together.

297
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:51,486
And that one day
you might get married...

298
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,657
...and have children of your own.

299
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,831
- Dude, are you okay?
- Totally.

300
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,210
Ross, you don't seem okay.

301
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,545
I'm sorry, it must be
the pressure of entertaining.

302
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,096
I think everyone would
feel better if we had some flan.

303
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,891
Wait, Ross. Ross, I, um...
I have to take off.

304
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,893
- No!
- I'm sorry.

305
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,729
I have an early class in the morning.

306
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,316
But this has been lovely.

307
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:35,154
Wasn't it? And you thought it
would be awkward with Joey.

308
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,657
And that you never
really liked Rachel.

309
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:43,079
You are on fire!
I'll call you in the morning, okay?

310
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,914
- Okay.
- All right.

311
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,128
Rachel, what Ross just said,
that's just...

312
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,506
Oh, that's okay.
Girls tend not to like me.

313
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,424
Fine.

314
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,305
Okay. I guess it's just flan for three.

315
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,141
Hey.

316
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,351
Hey, that rhymes.

317
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,690
You know what, Ross,
I think, uh, we're gonna take off too.

318
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:15,820
Oh, oh. Heh.
Of course. God, I'm so stupid.

319
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,530
You guys are a couple now.

320
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,158
I mean, you probably
just want to be alone.

321
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,995
- No, it's just getting late...
- It's fine. It's totally fine.

322
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,123
I've got plenty of margaritas.
It's all good.

323
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,132
I don't even know what that's for.

324
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,222
You know what?

325
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,517
I think I'm gonna stay here
and make sure he's okay.

326
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,103
- That's probably a good idea.
- I'll see you in the morning.

327
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,856
Uh-huh. Okay.
- All right.

328
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,858
Yeah, you know, Joey, I...

329
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,486
I don't think he's ever
gonna be okay with this.

330
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:00,156
- It doesn't look good, does it?
- Mm-mm.

331
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,302
Morning.

332
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,347
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

333
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:28,309
- Did you stay here all night?
- Yeah.

334
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,939
So you took off my pants and shoes?

335
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,815
No. No, no.

336
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:39,028
You actually did that when you
were dancing to the Chicago soundtrack.

337
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,367
Ahem. Look, uh, Ross...

338
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,995
...about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't
have to worry about that...

339
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,373
...because nothing's gonna happen.

340
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,791
What do you mean?

341
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,253
She and I said from the beginning...

342
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,339
...we weren't gonna do anything
unless you were okay with it.

343
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,882
And clearly...

344
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,802
What are you talking about? I'm fine.

345
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,931
It's okay, Ross.
You know, I totally understand.

346
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,058
Of course you're not fine. You're...

347
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,604
You're Ross and Rachel.

348
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,109
Yeah, except we're not.

349
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,446
I mean, we haven't been
a couple in, like...

350
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,617
...six years.

351
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,955
My God, is that right?

352
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,748
Has it been that long?

353
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,127
That's what I hear, yeah.

354
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,424
This is crazy.
I mean, six years...

355
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,885
...and because of me,
you guys aren't gonna be together?

356
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,222
Can I ask you something?

357
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,849
Really...

358
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:53,185
...what is this thing
with you and Rachel?

359
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:59,108
Come on, you know me. Ha, ha.
You know...

360
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,402
Joey.

361
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,328
I'm crazy about her.

362
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,210
And she feels the same way?

363
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,256
I think so.

364
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,344
Well, then...

365
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,721
...maybe it's time
we all moved on.

366
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,891
Yeah, but, Ross, I mean,
you're not okay with it, so...

367
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,144
No, but I want to be.

368
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,146
And hey:

369
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,023
I will be.

370
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,820
Besides, I'm with Charlie, right?

371
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:47,490
Oh, my God,
I'm still with Charlie, aren't I?

372
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,242
- She didn't see the dance, did she?
- No, no, no.

373
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:55,081
No, that was, uh...
That was just for me.

374
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,586
Hey, you, uh?

375
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,546
You sure about this?

376
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,424
Yeah, I'm sure.

377
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,178
And...

378
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,014
...we're okay?

379
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,152
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

380
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,488
Um, we just want to give
you a heads up.

381
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,615
Bill and Colleen hate us.

382
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,159
Owen didn't know he's adopted
and Monica told him.

383
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,494
What?

384
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,871
Still, he had to find out sometime.

385
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:40,251
How would you like it if someone told
the triplets that you gave birth to them?

386
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,133
I'm gonna go tell Emma
she was an accident.
