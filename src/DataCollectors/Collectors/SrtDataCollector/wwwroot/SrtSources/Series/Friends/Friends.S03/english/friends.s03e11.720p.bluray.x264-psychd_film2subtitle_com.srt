1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,795
Okay, pick a card, any card.

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:07,548
All right, now memorize it.

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,009
Show it to everybody.

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,218
- Got it?
Mm-hm.

5
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,470
All right. Give it back to me.

6
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:19,977
Five of hearts.

7
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,771
- Real magic does exist.
- Oh, wow.

8
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:25,315
Wow. Joey, how do you do it?

9
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,942
I can't tell you that. No.

10
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,781
Uh, somebody's at the door
on the ceiling.

11
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:36,702
Heh. No, that's our unbelievably loud
upstairs neighbor.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,538
He took up the carpets,
and now you can hear everything.

13
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:43,208
Well, why don't you go up there
and ask him to just step lightly, please?

14
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,254
I have, like five times,
but the guy is so charming...

15
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,382
...that I go up there to yell,
and I end up apologizing to him.

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,510
Oh, that is silly.

17
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,846
I'll go up there.
I'll tell him to keep it down.

18
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,931
- All right, be my guest.
- Good luck.

19
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,600
All right, all right, all right.

20
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,186
If you really wanna know how I did it,
I'll show you.

21
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,731
When you handed me back the card,
what you didn't see was...

22
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,068
...I looked at it so fast,
it was invisible to the naked eye.

23
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,238
I just did it.

24
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,990
Just did it again.

25
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,661
Here, I'll slow it down
so you guys can see it. Ready?

26
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:25,167
- Oh.
- I got it now. Okay.

27
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,966
I was at my friend's downstairs...

28
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,260
...and we hear every single thing
that you do.

29
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,852
Oh. Ha, ha. Thank you.

30
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,946
Hey.

31
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,242
Anybody got a length of rope
about 6 feet long with a noose at the end?

32
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,369
- Honey, what's the matter?
- I just saw Janice.

33
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,662
Aw.

34
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,582
She was at Rockefeller Center,
skating with her husband.

35
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,959
She looked so happy.

36
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,713
I almost feel bad
for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.

37
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,217
I remember the first time
I saw that girl Katherine after we broke up.

38
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,387
She was walking with her friend Donna,
just laughing and talking.

39
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,014
God, it killed me.

40
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:06,476
Yes, but you ended up having sex
with both of them that afternoon.

41
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,606
Sorry, I just...
Any excuse to tell that story.

42
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,195
Hey, Chandler, there's a party tomorrow.
You'll feel better then.

43
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,865
Oh. You know what? I'm gonna be okay.
You don't have to throw a party for me.

44
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,201
It's Joey's birthday.

45
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,163
Oh, well, then if anybody
should have a party, it should be him.

46
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:31,210
Shh. I cannot believe she's still up there.

47
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,764
Okay, well,
he totally screwed up the punch line.

48
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,098
You know, it's supposed to be:

49
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,944
- How's that coffee coming, dear?
- Yeah. Right away, Mr. Kaplan.

50
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,655
I'm not supposed to drink coffee.
It makes me gassy.

51
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,158
I know.

52
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,870
I'll bet you're thinking,
"What's an intelligent girl...

53
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,748
...who wants to be in fashion
doing making coffee?"

54
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,418
- Ah? Ah? Ha, ha.
- Oh, ha, ha. You got me. Heh.

55
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,754
Don't think I haven't noticed
your potential.

56
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:20,175
Well, I've got a project for you
that's a lot more related to fashion.

57
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,928
- How does that sound?
- Oh. That sounds great.

58
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,265
- Come on over here, sweetheart.
- Thank you so much, Mr. Kaplan.

59
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:30,811
I need these hangers separated ASAP.

60
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,314
You're welcome.

61
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,737
Oh, God, I hate my job.
I hate it. I hate my job.

62
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,572
I know, honey. I'm sorry.

63
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,118
Oh. I wanna quit,
but then I think I should stick it out.

64
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,577
Then I think...

65
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,872
...why would such a person stay
in such a demeaning job...

66
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,585
...just because it's remotely related
to the field they're interested in?

67
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,922
Gee, I don't know, Rach.

68
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,926
Order up. I got a Yentl soup, James Beans,
and a Howdy, hold the Doody.

69
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,762
Oh. Honey, come on, I'm sorry. I didn't...

70
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,306
I don't mind paying my dues.

71
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,891
It's just, how much am I gonna learn
about fashion...

72
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,644
...by walking Myra,
the arthritic seamstress...

73
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,354
...to the bathroom?

74
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,735
Hi. Is my misery amusing to you?

75
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,779
I'm sorry, I was just, uh... Ha, ha.

76
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,073
It's not funny. This is actually my job.

77
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,783
Oh, believe me, I've been there.

78
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:30,329
I had to sort mannequin heads
at Mannequins Plus.

79
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,875
Oh. Well, then, so I'm just gonna go back
to talking to my friend here.

80
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,086
You can go back
to enjoying your little hamburger.

81
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,758
- Uh, just one other thing.
- Ahem. Yes?

82
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,509
I work at Bloomingdale's...

83
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,929
...and I might know of a job possibility,
if you're interested.

84
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,267
Do you want my pickle?

85
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,609
Hey, guys.

86
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,902
- Hey, Gunther.
- Hi.

87
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,696
You're going out on a date
with the noisy guy upstairs?

88
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,367
- Well, he's very charming.
- I know, he's too charming.

89
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,953
But if you go out, it's gonna make it
so much harder for me to hate him.

90
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,956
Well, you're just going to have to try.

91
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,126
All right. Joey?
Where are the Jell-O shots?

92
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,296
I don't know.
Chandler's supposed to be passing them...

93
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,509
- Chandler.
- Hello-dee-lo.

94
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,261
Well, somebody's feeling better.

95
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,765
- Stick out your tongue.
- Take off your shirt.

96
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,396
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my God.

97
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,190
How many of these did you have?
These are pure vodka.

98
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,943
Yeah, Jell-O just like Mom used to make.

99
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,364
The most unbelievable thing
happened to me today.

100
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,698
- Hi.
- Hi.

101
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,910
I'm having lunch at Monica's
and this guy starts talking to me...

102
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,246
...and he works for a buyer
at Bloomingdale's...

103
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,749
...and there's an opening in his department.
So I gave him my phone number...

104
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,919
...and he's gonna call me this weekend
to see if he can get me an interview.

105
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,255
- Wow. Ha, ha.
- I know.

106
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,757
What, so this guy's helping you
for no apparent reason?

107
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,259
Uh-huh.

108
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,595
And he's a total stranger?

109
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,015
Yeah. His name is, um, Mark something.

110
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:17,894
Ah. Sounds like Mark Something
wants to have some sex.

111
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,939
What?

112
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:25,110
I'm just saying, why else would he just
swoop in out of nowhere for no reason?

113
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,070
To be nice?

114
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:31,074
Hey, Joey, are men ever nice
to strange women for no reason?

115
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,742
- No, only for sex.
- Thank you.

116
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:39,040
So did you tell Mark Something
about me?

117
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:43,503
I didn't have to, because I was wearing
my "I Heart Ross" sandwich board...

118
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,838
...and ringing my bell.

119
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,381
Ah. Uh-huh.

120
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,802
Joey! Happy birthday!

121
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,762
Hey!

122
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,726
Okay, how many of that girl
are you seeing?

123
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,190
How hammered are you? Huh?
These are Joey's sisters.

124
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,816
Hi, Joey's sisters.

125
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,526
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

126
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,236
What are we drinking over here?

127
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,615
Oh, well, I have a vodka
and cranberry juice.

128
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:12,866
No kidding?

129
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,745
That's the exact same drink I made myself
right after I shot my husband.

130
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,040
Wow.

131
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,584
Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.

132
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,004
What are you doing?

133
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,798
I'm taking my ex-girlfriend
off my speed dialer.

134
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,175
Aw.

135
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,427
No, no, no, it's a good thing.

136
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:36,598
Why must we dial so speedily anyway?
Why must we rush through life?

137
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:41,269
Why can't we savor the precious moments?
Those are some huge breasts you have.

138
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,855
- Hi.
- Hi.

139
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:49,194
Yeah, heh. So, um, I heard about
this Mark guy that Rachel met today.

140
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,113
- Oh, yeah, isn't that great?
- Oh, yeah.

141
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,158
So, uh, yeah, pretty good.
He sounds like a nice, good guy.

142
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,495
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy.

143
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,456
I mean, you know what?
When he left, I actually used the phrase...

144
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,625
..."homina, homina, homina."

145
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,546
That's excellent.

146
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,552
So he's just a nice guy.

147
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:17,973
You really think this Mark doesn't want
anything in exchange for helping you?

148
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,017
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers
with him.

149
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,978
But, you know, that's true of any job.

150
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,066
Uh-oh.

151
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,276
How you feeling?

152
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,570
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore...

153
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,114
...because I drank it.

154
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,744
Where'd you get to? We lost you
after you opened up all the presents.

155
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:44,332
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room,
and not alone.

156
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,542
Woo-hoo.

157
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,751
- Really?
- Aah.

158
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,546
No "woo-hooing." No "woo-hooing."

159
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,631
Why, what happened?

160
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,720
I fooled around with Joey's sister.

161
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,600
- Well, that's not the worst part.
- What is the worst part?

162
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,810
I can't remember which sister.

163
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,689
You see what men do?
Don't tell me men are nice.

164
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,566
This is men.

165
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,487
Are you insane?

166
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,616
Joey's gonna kill you.
He's actually going to kill you dead.

167
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,909
Okay. You don't think I thought of that?

168
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,705
- How can you not know which one?
- I mean, that's unbelievable.

169
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,874
- I mean, was it Gina?
- Which one is Gina?

170
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,209
The dark, big hair,
with the airplane earrings.

171
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,420
No, no, no, that's not Gina, that's Dina.

172
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,673
See? You can't tell
which is which either. Blah.

173
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,845
We didn't fool around with any of them.
Blah. Blah.

174
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,809
Veronica. Look, it's gotta be Veronica.
The girl in the red skirt.

175
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,354
I definitely stuck my tongue
down her throat.

176
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,523
That was me.

177
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,404
Oh. When I've been drinking,
sometimes I tend to get overly friendly.

178
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,239
- And I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

179
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,867
- That's all right.
- That's okay.

180
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,665
Can I talk to you for a second?

181
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,418
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey.

182
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,505
Come on.

183
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:18,259
Why can't we talk in here,
with witnesses?

184
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,721
- I just got off the phone with my sister.
- Uh, which one?

185
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,390
- Mary Angela.
- Mary Angela.

186
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,643
- Yeah.
- Now, which one is she again?

187
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,312
Ask Chandler.
He's the one who fooled around with her.

188
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:33,024
She told me you said
you could really fall for her.

189
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:37,278
Now, is that true, or are you just
getting over Janice by groping my sister?

190
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,450
It's gotta be the first one.

191
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,619
Really?

192
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,579
That's great.

193
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,375
You and my sister, sitting in a tree.

194
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,670
Yep, I'm in a tree.

195
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,383
Did he call? Did Mark call?

196
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,844
No, honey, I'm sorry.
But the weekend's not over yet.

197
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,100
Oh, my God. Is that Phoebe?

198
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,519
- Guess they're back from their date.
- Ah.

199
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:15,650
Music. Very nice.

200
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,320
Uh-huh. Oh.

201
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,951
Oh, my God.

202
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,414
So how are you?

203
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,585
- I am good. I finished my book.
- Oh, yeah? What's it about?

204
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,712
I don't remember.
Do you wanna take a walk?

205
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,380
Yeah, I do.

206
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,135
"Dear Mary Angela:

207
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,012
Hi, how's it going?

208
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,639
This is the hardest letter
I've ever had to write."

209
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:50,351
What the hell's the matter with you?
How do you think Joey's gonna react...

210
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,229
...when he finds out
you blew off his sister with a letter?

211
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:56,691
That's the part where you tell him
that I moved to France...

212
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,985
...when actually I'll be in Cuba.

213
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,030
All right, look, look,
you've got to do this yourself, okay?

214
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,365
In person. At least you know her name.

215
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,243
You just go to the house
and you ask for Mary Angela, okay?

216
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,537
When whichever one she is
comes to the door...

217
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,831
...take her for a walk,
you let her down easy.

218
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,082
Okay.

219
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,878
What if Mary Angela comes to the door
and I ask for Mary Angela?

220
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,672
Where in Cuba?

221
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,229
Joey, what...? What are you doing here?

222
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,439
Waiting for my grandma
to finish my laundry.

223
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,732
What about you?

224
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,860
Uh, I'm here to see Mary Angela.

225
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,447
You are so the man. Come on.

226
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,034
Now, look, listen. Listen.

227
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,204
You gotta be cool, because my grandma
doesn't know about you two.

228
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,914
You do not wanna tick her off.

229
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:57,377
She was, like, the sixth person
to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.

230
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,045
Yeah.

231
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,296
Where's Mary Angela?

232
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,842
- She's right in there.
- Okay.

233
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,054
Hey, Chandler.

234
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,687
I can't believe Mark didn't call.
It's Sunday night and he didn't call.

235
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,897
Bummer.

236
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:21,484
Yeah, right. Look at you.
You're practically giddy.

237
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,195
No, I'm genuinely sorry
the Mark thing didn't work out.

238
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:28,616
Look, Rach,
I want only good things for you.

239
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,119
Wait a minute.
Why don't you just call Mark?

240
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,124
Who says you have to sit here
and wait for him?

241
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,001
You've got to make stuff happen.

242
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,796
Yeah, but you don't
wanna seem too pushy.

243
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,340
Honey, it's not pushy.
He gave her his home number.

244
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:48,094
Wha...? He gave you his home number,
as in, like, to his home?

245
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:52,140
Yeah. And you don't mind if I call,
because you only want good things for me.

246
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:56,144
That's right, good things.
That is what I said.

247
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:03,109
Ahem. Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green.

248
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:09,365
Ha, ha. Oh, no. Don't you apologize.

249
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,617
Yeah, I'll hold.

250
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,577
He left my number at work.

251
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,289
He was gonna get it, but he was helping
his niece with her report on the pioneers.

252
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,959
- Aw.
- That is so made up.

253
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:24,297
Yeah. Oh, my God. Tomorrow?
That's... No, it's perfect.

254
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:28,384
Oh, God. Thank you so much.
Great. Bye.

255
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,011
Oh! I got the interview.

256
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,930
- Oh, yay!
- There you go.

257
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,224
He even offered to meet me for lunch
and prep me for it.

258
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,143
- Oh, that is amazing.
- Yeah.

259
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,605
Well, if I know Mark, and I think I do...

260
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,734
...I'd expect nothing less.
- I gotta figure out what I'm gonna wear.

261
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,321
High collar and baggy pants say,
"I'm a pro."

262
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,449
Yeah, right. Okay, I'll see you guys later.

263
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,659
- Woo-hoo!
- Okay.

264
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,911
You go get them.

265
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,164
What did I do to you?
Did I hurt you in some way?

266
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,335
- What?
- "Why don't you call him?"

267
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,837
Well, thank you very much.
Now he's gonna prep her.

268
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:10,218
You know, prep her, as in what you do
before you surgically remove the boyfriend.

269
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,636
Are you crazy?

270
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:15,264
Oh, am I? Am I? Am I out of my mind?
Am I losing my senses?

271
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,311
This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend
out for a meal.

272
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,522
Ross, you know, this isn't even about you.

273
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,441
This is about Rachel
and something happening for her.

274
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,360
- Uh-huh.
- Even if you're right.

275
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,697
What if he wants to sleep with her?
Does that mean he gets to?

276
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,824
- No, but...
- I mean, don't you trust her?

277
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,242
Well, yeah...

278
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,953
Then get over yourself. Grow up.

279
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,251
You grow up.

280
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,682
This tiramisu is excellent.

281
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,144
- Did you make it, Mary Angela?
- No, I did.

282
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,063
Well, it's yummy.

283
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,943
So, uh, Mary Angela, do you like it?

284
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,362
Of course. It's her favorite.

285
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,408
So, um, hmm...

286
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,369
Mary Angela,
what's your second favorite?

287
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,163
More of Grandma's tiramisu.

288
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,124
Oh, would you just please...

289
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,711
...give me your recipe,
because this is great.

290
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,588
It's top-notch.

291
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,883
- That dies with me.
- So will I.

292
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,720
Excuse yourself and go to the bathroom.

293
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,514
Oh, no, I was just squinting.
That doesn't mean anything.

294
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,224
Just do it.

295
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,149
Will you excuse me? I have to, um...

296
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,953
Hey...

297
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,539
Finally. I thought we'd never be alone.

298
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,999
Can I just tell you something?

299
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,752
I have not stopped thinking about you
since the party.

300
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,046
Mm. Mm.

301
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,966
Look, I may have jumped the gun here.
Whoa.

302
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,802
Uh... Ahem.

303
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,804
I just got out of a relationship.

304
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,933
And I'm not really in a...
In a commitment kind of place.

305
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,184
So? Me neither.

306
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,687
God, Mary Angela was right.
You do have the softest lips.

307
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,397
Aah.

308
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:32,318
- You're not Mary Angela?
- No. I'm Mary Therese.

309
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,821
This is so bad.

310
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,824
If you're not Mary Angela, then who is?

311
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,742
I am.

312
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,995
Oh, it's so bad.

313
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:46,833
- Joey!
- No Joey. No Joey. No Joey.

314
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,168
- Joey.
- What's going on?

315
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,338
You're it. Now run and hide.

316
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,674
It's no big deal.

317
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,386
Chandler was just kissing me
because he thought I was Mary Angela.

318
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,722
What? How could you do that?
How could you think she was Mary Angela?

319
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,851
I wasn't sure
which one Mary Angela was.

320
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,728
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

321
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,982
I was really drunk,
and you guys all look really similar.

322
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,233
I say punch him, Joey.

323
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,068
- Yeah, punch him.
- Yeah, kick him.

324
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,528
We should all calm down...

325
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,906
...because, you know,
your brother's not gonna punch me.

326
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,992
Are you?

327
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,952
Well, that is usually what I would do.

328
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,496
But I never thought
you'd be on the receiving end.

329
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,331
How could you do this?

330
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,876
Joey, if you wanna punch me, go ahead.
I deserve it.

331
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:34,422
But I just want you to know that I would
never soberly hurt you or your family.

332
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,507
You're my best friend.

333
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,427
And I would never do anything
like this ever again.

334
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,430
So what?

335
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,516
- I say punch him. Punch him.
- Yeah, punch him.

336
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:49,353
- Come on, punch him.
- No. No. I'm not gonna punch Chandler.

337
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,814
- I'll do it.
- No, you won't.

338
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,026
Look, he knows he did a terrible thing,
and I believe him.

339
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,904
He's sorry.
But you got one more apology to make.

340
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,740
All right?
You gotta apologize to Mary Angela.

341
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,784
- Okay. Absolutely. You got it.
- All right.

342
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,463
- Cookie, now you can punch him.
- What?

343
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:24,972
- Hey.
- Hi.

344
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,265
What are you doing here?

345
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,185
You know,
this building's on my paper route, so...

346
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,020
- Oh. Hi.
- Hi.

347
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,230
How did it go?

348
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,066
Oh, well, the woman I interviewed with
was pretty tough...

349
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,235
...but, you know,
thank God Mark coached me.

350
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,446
Once I started talking about the fall line,
she got all happy.

351
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,491
- I'm so proud of you.
- Me too.

352
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,576
Listen, I'm, uh...

353
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:51,082
I'm sorry I've been so crazy
and jealous and...

354
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,584
It's just, I like you a lot, so...

355
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,794
I know.

356
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,003
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

357
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,213
- Rachel.
- Yeah?

358
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,631
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi, Mark.

359
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,134
I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you.
You got it. You got the job.

360
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,678
- What?
- Oh! I did?

361
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:04,929
Yes.

362
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,305
- Aah!
- Oh, my God!

363
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,016
- Congratulations...
- Oh! Wow.

364
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,523
- So, Phoebe.
- Hmm?

365
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,816
How was your date?

366
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,026
Oh, well, you know. Ha, ha.

367
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,654
Yeah, I do know.

368
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,239
Ick. You were eavesdropping?

369
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:27,285
Eavesdropping?
Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.

370
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,496
Oh, I'm sorry.

371
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:35,960
But I really like this guy,
and I think he really happens to like me.

372
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,169
- Aw.
- Yay.

373
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,845
Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo stick
and he really likes it.

374
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,600
Maybe the pogo stick likes it too.

375
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,188
All right, that's it.
He cannot do this to Phoebe.

376
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:59,608
This guy's gonna get the butt-kicking
of a lifetime.

377
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,278
But is he a big guy?

378
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,571
We'll all go. Come on.

379
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,449
- Thanks, you guys. Thank you.
- Don't worry.

380
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:10,161
God. I hope they kick his ass.

381
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,829
Honey, I'm sorry.

382
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,664
You know, if it's any consolation...

383
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,667
...he really did sound
like he was having more fun with you.
