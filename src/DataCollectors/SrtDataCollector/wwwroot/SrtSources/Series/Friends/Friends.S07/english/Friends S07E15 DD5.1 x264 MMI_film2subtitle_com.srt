1
00:00:01,356 --> 00:00:02,709
Thanks for coming by.

2
00:00:02,991 --> 00:00:07,024
We wanted to bounce some ideas off
of you about the wedding ceremony.

3
00:00:08,037 --> 00:00:10,884
- What's the matter? Are you okay?
- It's just...

4
00:00:11,203 --> 00:00:13,670
Monica said, "wedding."

5
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:17,140
We thought one of you
could read something.

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,706
I would love to read a poem.

7
00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:25,674
Do you think you could
get through a poem?

8
00:00:26,406 --> 00:00:28,518
A short one.

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,108
Okay, so Ross will
be doing the reading.

10
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,215
Okay, yeah, I guess I can do that too.

11
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:39,137
Too?

12
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:43,240
I kind of have something else
planned for you guys.

13
00:00:43,942 --> 00:00:46,230
- Do you mind telling us what it is?
- Sorry.

14
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:49,742
I'm kind of keeping this one
on the q. T.

15
00:00:52,117 --> 00:00:54,715
Whatever it is,
I hope it involves winking.

16
00:00:57,198 --> 00:00:58,478
- Hey.
- Hey.

17
00:00:58,798 --> 00:01:00,815
I talked to one of the DOOL writers...

18
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:03,145
- What is DOOL?
- Days of Our Lives.

19
00:01:05,304 --> 00:01:09,017
You're not gonna believe it. My
character is coming out of his coma!

20
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,249
- That's wonderful.
- Wow, Joey.

21
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:15,207
And not only that,
I'm getting a new brain!

22
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:20,330
So great things are happening at work
and in your personal life.

23
00:01:21,586 --> 00:01:23,045
You're getting a new brain?

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,993
They're killing off
one of the characters on the show...

25
00:01:26,248 --> 00:01:29,166
...and her brain is being transplanted
into my body.

26
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,523
What? A brain transplant?

27
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:37,688
Yes, it's a highly
controversial procedure.

28
00:01:38,529 --> 00:01:40,818
It's ridiculous.

29
00:01:41,522 --> 00:01:44,713
It's ridiculous that you haven't
had sex in three and a half months.

30
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:53,864
It's winter.
There are fewer people on the street.

31
00:01:57,595 --> 00:01:58,805
Who are they killing off?

32
00:01:59,022 --> 00:02:01,418
Cecilia Monroe.
She plays Jessica Lockhart.

33
00:02:01,702 --> 00:02:03,160
No!

34
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,124
She's my favorite character on DOOL.

35
00:02:07,964 --> 00:02:08,972
Nice.

36
00:02:10,503 --> 00:02:14,014
She is so good at throwing drinks
in people's faces.

37
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:16,928
I don't think I've ever seen
her finish a beverage.

38
00:02:17,252 --> 00:02:19,790
The way she slaps people.
Wouldn't you love to do that?

39
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:21,565
Don't do it.

40
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:26,088
- Cecilia Monroe, what a great actress.
- Tell me about it.

41
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:28,137
And she's been on the show forever.

42
00:02:28,387 --> 00:02:30,960
It's gonna be really hard
to fill her shoes.

43
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,656
Help me out here.

44
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:37,391
When you come out
of the brain transplant...

45
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:40,525
...you are going to be her?

46
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:43,689
Yes, but in Drake Ramoray's body.

47
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:51,379
Why is this so hard for you to get?
I thought you were a scientist.

48
00:02:52,636 --> 00:02:56,835
The One With Joey's New Brain

49
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,648
Rach, so that guy there...

50
00:03:33,934 --> 00:03:34,966
...straight or gay?

51
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,089
Well, I'd have to say gay.

52
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:41,831
Yeah? Why?

53
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,551
Mainly because he's kissing
that other guy.

54
00:03:45,903 --> 00:03:49,449
Oh, no, not that guy there.
That guy right there.

55
00:03:51,226 --> 00:03:54,180
Oh, yeah, he's too cute
to be straight.

56
00:03:55,643 --> 00:03:57,660
Knockers will help us
figure it out.

57
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:05,098
All right, straight.

58
00:04:05,942 --> 00:04:07,674
And not subtle.

59
00:04:10,744 --> 00:04:12,653
He left his cell phone.

60
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:15,463
We could hand it to Gunther
to put it in lost and found.

61
00:04:15,753 --> 00:04:19,359
Or we could use it to call China,
see how those guys are doing.

62
00:04:20,102 --> 00:04:23,198
What if he calls his own cell phone
and I answer...

63
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:26,880
...and we start talking
and we fell in love?

64
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,242
Wouldn't that be a great story?

65
00:04:29,532 --> 00:04:32,307
Kind of like a fairy tale
for the digital age.

66
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:35,166
That does sound great.
I'm gonna get the phone.

67
00:04:35,516 --> 00:04:38,777
What? Wait.
Why do you get the story?

68
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,662
I haven't been
out on a date in so long.

69
00:04:41,987 --> 00:04:44,383
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.

70
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,219
That wasn't a date. That was friends
getting together and having sex.

71
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:51,588
Okay. Great. I get the phone.

72
00:04:51,902 --> 00:04:54,962
No way. You just broke up with Tag
a week ago.

73
00:04:55,277 --> 00:05:00,484
Yeah, and until now, I didn't think
I would love again.

74
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,785
- Nice try.
- Wait.

75
00:05:03,105 --> 00:05:06,094
How do we fairly decide
who gets the phone?

76
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,142
I don't know.

77
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:17,574
Maybe we could...

78
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:19,938
Aha! Too slow!

79
00:05:22,275 --> 00:05:24,944
Aha! Too cocky.

80
00:05:29,338 --> 00:05:31,699
I'm dating him.
There's nothing you can do.

81
00:05:31,947 --> 00:05:32,919
Yes, there is.

82
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:36,424
What are you going to do, kill him?
Like you did Charles?

83
00:05:36,749 --> 00:05:39,074
That was an accident.

84
00:05:39,846 --> 00:05:42,099
And so were you.

85
00:05:43,672 --> 00:05:46,068
Well, at least I'm not a murderer.

86
00:05:47,534 --> 00:05:50,310
Oh, my baby.

87
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,123
Cut!

88
00:06:00,372 --> 00:06:04,891
That was a great scene. That slap
looked so real. How do you do that?

89
00:06:05,173 --> 00:06:08,779
- Oh, just years of experience.
- Can I get some ice here?!

90
00:06:10,531 --> 00:06:13,272
I just wanted to say how wonderful
I think you are.

91
00:06:13,697 --> 00:06:16,129
You're not the fan who's dying,
are you?

92
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:19,642
I'm supposed to meet
and hug a fan who's dying.

93
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:22,773
But that's not suppose
to be until later.

94
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:25,976
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
We did a scene together yesterday.

95
00:06:26,258 --> 00:06:29,591
- I'm the guy in the coma.
- Oh, that was a real person?

96
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:35,714
Since I'm getting your brain
when you leave the show...

97
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:37,801
...I was wondering if...

98
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:41,526
- I'm leaving the show?
- Why? Did you hear something?

99
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,252
Who told you that?

100
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:50,008
- One of the writers.
- Which writer? Was it bald or was it tall?

101
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:54,089
You know, it doesn't matter,
because it is not true.

102
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:55,437
Okay.

103
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:59,367
And if it were true, how dare you come
to me and ask me for tips...

104
00:06:59,658 --> 00:07:02,290
...about a character I've played
for 20 years!

105
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:10,327
Miss Monroe...
Oh, there you go.

106
00:07:22,272 --> 00:07:26,400
No, Phoebe, you cannot get the phone
that way. That's not fair.

107
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:27,866
Okay, look, I have an idea.

108
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:31,865
Why don't we see what kind of numbers
he has on his speed dial...

109
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:37,230
...and then whoever has more in common
with him gets the phone.

110
00:07:37,615 --> 00:07:42,515
Or we can decide by whoever's name
is closer to the word "phone."

111
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,214
I don't think so.

112
00:07:48,157 --> 00:07:52,985
Fine. But I bet you'd be singing a different
tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.

113
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:58,026
First name on the speed dial is "Mom."

114
00:07:58,282 --> 00:08:01,580
Oh. I lost my mom to suicide.

115
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:06,102
No way. You can't use that to get the
cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.

116
00:08:06,283 --> 00:08:08,857
Did I use that already
today? I'm sorry.

117
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:12,473
Well, now, see,
this isn't telling us anything.

118
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,043
- "Joe. Carlos. Yoga. Ben..."
- Wait. I do yoga. That's one for me.

119
00:08:19,261 --> 00:08:22,108
Oh, all right. Oh, so close.
If only it said, "yogurt."

120
00:08:24,723 --> 00:08:26,739
"Peter Luger." That's a steak house.

121
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:30,978
Okay, fine. Meat-eater.
Fine, that's one for you.

122
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,468
Oh, I win. He's got Barneys
on his speed dial.

123
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:38,113
You don't know it's Barneys
the store.

124
00:08:38,396 --> 00:08:40,969
That could be his friend's
house or a bar...

125
00:08:41,284 --> 00:08:43,396
Who has Barneys the store
on their speed dial?

126
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:45,735
His new girlfriend.

127
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:05,037
What is that?

128
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,960
I think it's the Dying Cat Parade.

129
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:12,793
Sounds like it's coming
from across the street.

130
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:16,554
- Oh, my God.
- What?

131
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,129
The thing that Ross was gonna
do at our wedding?

132
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:23,057
He was hanging out with me and said,
"You're half Scottish, right?"

133
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:26,304
- No.
- Yes!

134
00:09:37,194 --> 00:09:40,943
No. There is no way.
It cannot be Ross.

135
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:54,239
Unbelievable.
Why is your family Scottish?

136
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:58,303
Why is your family Ross?

137
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:02,380
He cannot play at our wedding.
Everyone will leave.

138
00:10:02,627 --> 00:10:05,853
It'll be like when he rapped
at my bat mitzvah.

139
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:10,484
We can't just tell him no. He's probably
been practicing forever. He'll be crushed.

140
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:13,652
Maybe there's a way we can tell him
without hurting his feelings.

141
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:16,533
I mean, come on. That is just noise!

142
00:10:17,378 --> 00:10:19,216
It's not even a song.

143
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:22,803
Wait. If you listen very carefully...

144
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:26,074
...I think it's "Celebration"
by Kool and the Gang.

145
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:41,584
- Hi. How are you?
- Good.

146
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:44,268
Remember when we were
in the coffeehouse...

147
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:47,540
...we decided I was gonna keep
the cute guy's phone?

148
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:52,339
I was gonna keep it in my purse so if
it rang, I could just pick it up?

149
00:10:53,422 --> 00:10:57,764
Do you remember going into my purse
and stealing the phone?

150
00:10:59,268 --> 00:11:00,548
Now you lost me.

151
00:11:01,147 --> 00:11:03,199
- You stole the phone.
- No, I didn't.

152
00:11:03,513 --> 00:11:06,430
You're saying that if I called it,
it wouldn't ring?

153
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:07,754
- No.
- Okay.

154
00:11:08,105 --> 00:11:12,588
But while you dial, let me show you
the features of my new ringing handbag.

155
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:16,348
Oh, it does work.

156
00:11:17,742 --> 00:11:19,652
- Phoebe.
- That is a different phone.

157
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:24,656
Oh, is it? Hello. Yes, hi,
is Rachel there?

158
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:28,243
Yes, she is. Just one moment, please.
It's for me!

159
00:11:30,302 --> 00:11:32,069
That is damning evidence.

160
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:37,189
Oh, my God. I bet that's him.

161
00:11:37,678 --> 00:11:39,754
My digital fairy tale's
about to begin.

162
00:11:41,296 --> 00:11:44,522
I wonder how it should be?
Should I be, "Hello"?

163
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,852
Or should I be, "Hi! It's Ra..."?

164
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:49,640
Would you stop doing that?

165
00:11:49,925 --> 00:11:52,700
Hello? Yes, I'm the one
who found your phone.

166
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,690
- Phoebe, you can't...
- I'm on a call.

167
00:11:57,892 --> 00:12:01,747
Yeah, you can pick it up tonight.
Say, 8:30?

168
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:04,843
At my apartment.

169
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:08,605
It's 5 Morton Street,
apartment 14.

170
00:12:08,955 --> 00:12:12,988
And then maybe, you know, after,
we can grab a bite to eat or whatever.

171
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,593
Okay. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.

172
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,501
You do know that I will be here
when he comes over.

173
00:12:20,854 --> 00:12:22,966
How will you know what time
to come over?

174
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:25,472
You just said it.

175
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:34,939
Well, I was kind of hoping
that I would just be alone.

176
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:38,664
You know, to think about my mom
and her suicide.

177
00:12:38,877 --> 00:12:41,902
- Oh, Phoebe!
- What? That's the first time today.

178
00:12:48,061 --> 00:12:49,793
So you like the nachos, huh?

179
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,742
- Myself, I'm partial to...
- I'm 16.

180
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,548
See you in 2003.

181
00:12:57,524 --> 00:13:00,478
You're right.
They are writing me out of the show.

182
00:13:00,726 --> 00:13:04,059
They don't know exactly when
it's going to happen, but soon...

183
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:05,873
...and then that's it.

184
00:13:06,188 --> 00:13:09,142
I'm so sorry. If it was up to me,
you would never leave the show.

185
00:13:09,424 --> 00:13:11,476
- Yeah, thanks.
- I mean it.

186
00:13:11,754 --> 00:13:14,980
I can't believe they'd do this to you.
And to your fans.

187
00:13:15,234 --> 00:13:19,611
They're gonna be devastated.
Heartbroken. They love you so much.

188
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:22,152
Oh, you're right.

189
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:24,063
Thank you.

190
00:13:24,315 --> 00:13:26,082
What's your name again?

191
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:28,896
- Joey.
- Thank you.

192
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,367
That is so sweet.

193
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,528
Excuse me.

194
00:13:35,969 --> 00:13:39,480
- It wasn't my decision.
- I'm having a conversation here.

195
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:41,704
You were saying.

196
00:13:43,972 --> 00:13:48,100
Look, the only reason
I came up to you before...

197
00:13:48,321 --> 00:13:50,266
...is because, well...

198
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:53,110
...I'm really nervous about being you.

199
00:13:53,748 --> 00:13:58,196
If you could help me capture
the essence of the character, you know.

200
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,043
Help me keep Jessica alive.
Please?

201
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,982
All right, Joey, I'll help you.

202
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:08,668
Not because I owe it
to this stupid show...

203
00:14:08,986 --> 00:14:12,082
...but because I owe it to Jessica.

204
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:15,032
- Oh, that's great. Thank you so much.
- You're so welcome.

205
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:17,952
I've been watching some tapes.
How's this?

206
00:14:18,937 --> 00:14:22,341
Jessica Lockhart will never
step foot in this place again!

207
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,764
Never!

208
00:14:25,756 --> 00:14:28,426
- Is that supposed to be me?
- Yeah.

209
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,154
But Jessica doesn't have
an English accent.

210
00:14:32,993 --> 00:14:35,104
I can do an English accent?

211
00:14:37,272 --> 00:14:39,289
That baby's going on my résumé.

212
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:46,037
Well, I feel like a snack.

213
00:14:46,283 --> 00:14:49,829
Do you want some shortbread?
It's Scottish, like you are.

214
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,458
Oh, no, thanks. I don't like anything
from my Scottish heritage.

215
00:14:54,773 --> 00:14:56,232
What?

216
00:14:56,965 --> 00:15:00,891
Well, it's just that my entire family
was run out of Scotland by...

217
00:15:02,183 --> 00:15:03,642
...Vikings.

218
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,298
Anyway, lots of bad memories.

219
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:16,891
It sounds to me like your family's
ready to rediscover its Scottish roots.

220
00:15:17,109 --> 00:15:19,434
No. No, they're not.

221
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:21,203
They're still very angry.

222
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:23,926
But, you know, Chandler's also
half-Swedish.

223
00:15:24,137 --> 00:15:26,877
You know what the Swedish people
are famous for?

224
00:15:27,095 --> 00:15:29,633
Sitting down and being quiet.

225
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:34,916
Yeah, but the Scottish history
is so much...

226
00:15:35,096 --> 00:15:36,555
You can't play bagpipes
at the wedding!

227
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,833
How did you know about that?

228
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:45,908
- We heard you play from your apartment.
- Were you the ones who called the cops?

229
00:15:47,726 --> 00:15:49,908
That's not really important right now.

230
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:53,671
What is important is, while we
appreciate the gesture...

231
00:15:53,918 --> 00:15:58,022
...we just don't feel that bagpipes
are appropriate for our wedding.

232
00:15:58,337 --> 00:16:01,398
- Why not?
- Because we hate them.

233
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,836
Come on, that's not fair.
You haven't even heard me play.

234
00:16:05,087 --> 00:16:07,483
We have heard you play.

235
00:16:07,696 --> 00:16:09,463
No, you've heard me practice.

236
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:14,329
Just give me a chance to perform for
you, then decide whatever you want.

237
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,955
I'm not gonna tell you what song
I'm gonna play either.

238
00:16:18,238 --> 00:16:20,006
Let's just say when it's over...

239
00:16:20,326 --> 00:16:24,145
...I'll bet there'll be
a wee bit of celebration.

240
00:16:30,624 --> 00:16:35,310
The essence of the character
is rooted in her confidence.

241
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,305
So when Jessica enters a room,
for instance...

242
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:40,499
...she owns everything...

243
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:44,423
...and every person in that room.

244
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:47,733
- You try it.
- Okay.

245
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:56,085
All right!

246
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,984
No. He already knows
that he owns everything in the room.

247
00:17:00,197 --> 00:17:02,770
He's not finding it
out for the first time.

248
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,483
- So try it again.
- Okay.

249
00:17:12,582 --> 00:17:15,156
He's not angry at the room either.

250
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,537
Try it again. He owns it.
He owns the room.

251
00:17:19,784 --> 00:17:24,375
It is his. He owns, owns,
owns the room! He owns it!

252
00:17:25,107 --> 00:17:27,290
It's a little weird,
but it's getting better.

253
00:17:29,456 --> 00:17:33,561
I'm gonna miss this woman so much.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

254
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,058
It's been 20 years of my life.

255
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:40,029
Hey, hey. Maybe this is a good thing.

256
00:17:40,347 --> 00:17:44,237
It'll give you a chance to shake
things up. Play different characters.

257
00:17:44,556 --> 00:17:45,872
You're so talented.

258
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:48,483
I am, I am.

259
00:17:48,697 --> 00:17:50,357
But I don't know. You know...

260
00:17:50,576 --> 00:17:55,024
...an actor of a certain age,
it's not that easy.

261
00:17:55,272 --> 00:18:00,907
That's not true. Look at Angela
Lansbur... Angelina Jolie.

262
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:08,029
Probably should've just left years ago
when the offers were pouring in...

263
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,237
...but I just got
so comfy here and...

264
00:18:11,589 --> 00:18:14,259
I turned down some amazing work.

265
00:18:14,478 --> 00:18:15,723
Like what?

266
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:19,475
Well, let's just say
if I'd left 15 years ago...

267
00:18:19,835 --> 00:18:24,283
...the landscape of Mexican
cinema would be very different today.

268
00:18:26,376 --> 00:18:28,000
Wow.

269
00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:34,513
But, well, now...
Now's a different time for me.

270
00:18:36,396 --> 00:18:40,359
Oh, hey, come on. Don't do this.

271
00:18:40,676 --> 00:18:42,858
Let me tell you something, okay?

272
00:18:43,146 --> 00:18:47,796
When I watch you do a scene, I'm
thinking, "Boy, she is a great actress."

273
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:52,642
But I'm also thinking, "She is hot."

274
00:18:55,845 --> 00:18:57,897
You think I'm hot?

275
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:00,881
You own the room.

276
00:19:05,482 --> 00:19:07,426
We should probably get the...

277
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:09,750
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we should get...

278
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:18,072
So when Jessica kisses a man...

279
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,753
...she usually puts...

280
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,268
...both her hands on the man's face.

281
00:19:25,521 --> 00:19:28,333
I notice that.
Is that because she's so passionate?

282
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:31,882
No, it's because that way
the camera only sees her.

283
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,728
You want to try it?

284
00:19:38,012 --> 00:19:39,993
Yeah, okay.

285
00:19:52,242 --> 00:19:54,815
That was good. That was really good.

286
00:19:56,521 --> 00:20:01,907
But I think that maybe your hands are
just a little off. They should be right...

287
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:14,153
Hey, hey!

288
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,524
Who is it?

289
00:20:18,231 --> 00:20:20,449
It's Tom.
I'm here to pick up the phone.

290
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:24,768
Why do you get to answer the door?

291
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:27,589
- Why shouldn't I?
- Because it's my apartment.

292
00:20:27,868 --> 00:20:29,920
Then I get to give him the cell phone.

293
00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:33,603
Okay. Good luck explaining
all the calls to China.

294
00:20:37,854 --> 00:20:39,028
Hi.

295
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:45,430
Wow, how long were we arguing for?

296
00:20:49,996 --> 00:20:52,250
You're not the man who left the phone.

297
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:55,728
- No, that's my assistant.
- Is he coming?

298
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,920
No.

299
00:20:58,241 --> 00:21:00,981
- Could you give us one second?
- Sure.

300
00:21:01,304 --> 00:21:03,450
We'll be right back, sir.

301
00:21:04,992 --> 00:21:08,290
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

302
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:09,925
Can you believe this?

303
00:21:10,245 --> 00:21:13,305
We were waiting for a hot guy,
and then an even hotter one shows up.

304
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,936
I know.

305
00:21:18,803 --> 00:21:20,357
What?

306
00:21:21,517 --> 00:21:25,159
They just don't make them
like that anymore, you know?

307
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,389
No, they do,
but you just have to wait.

308
00:21:33,207 --> 00:21:35,461
Rachel, listen...

309
00:21:35,643 --> 00:21:39,842
...if you let me have him,
then I will really owe you one.

310
00:21:42,497 --> 00:21:44,335
All right.

311
00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:48,508
All right, I will let you have him.

312
00:21:48,898 --> 00:21:50,915
But you owe me. You owe me big.

313
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,006
Yeah. You're such a great friend.

314
00:21:55,196 --> 00:21:57,663
Which one of you lovely
ladies am I taking to dinner?

315
00:21:57,979 --> 00:22:00,090
Oh, that'd be me, sir.

316
00:22:01,214 --> 00:22:03,919
- After you.
- Oh, thank you.

317
00:22:04,972 --> 00:22:06,146
Nice.

318
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:17,282
Well, you certainly own that room.

319
00:22:19,515 --> 00:22:23,370
Actually, I rent the whole place.
I just got what you meant. Thank you.

320
00:22:26,821 --> 00:22:27,960
- Hi.
- Hey.

321
00:22:29,744 --> 00:22:31,096
Oh, my God.

322
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:33,186
Oh, my God.

323
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,738
Oh, Jessica Lockhart!
In my apartment!

324
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:41,180
I am such a huge fan.
I am such a huge fan.

325
00:22:41,468 --> 00:22:42,713
It's nice to know...

326
00:22:43,034 --> 00:22:44,350
Monica!

327
00:22:46,304 --> 00:22:48,487
That's my roommate, Rachel.

328
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,755
That explains all
the women's underwear.

329
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:52,531
Sure.

330
00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:56,358
Oh, my God, it's true!

331
00:22:57,438 --> 00:23:00,772
Oh, my God, you are so amazing.

332
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:04,911
Can I just ask you to do me
just one favor?

333
00:23:05,127 --> 00:23:06,515
Certainly.

334
00:23:06,866 --> 00:23:09,536
Would you slap me
right here in the face?

335
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,282
I'd love to, but my lawyer said
I can't do that anymore.

336
00:23:16,365 --> 00:23:19,769
God, you seem really, really nice.

337
00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:22,270
Okay, bye-bye.

338
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,626
I mean, not fake at all
like most famous people.

339
00:23:26,836 --> 00:23:28,496
All right, here we go.

340
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,872
No, wait. Just one more thing.

341
00:23:33,065 --> 00:23:36,540
- You're a stupid bitch.
- I really can't slap you.

342
00:23:36,753 --> 00:23:39,350
- You are so beautiful.
- So nice to meet you.

343
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:42,975
- My God, you're great.
- Thanks for stopping by.

344
00:23:44,928 --> 00:23:47,182
- I am so sorry about that.
- Oh, no.

345
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:50,280
Being adored, I'm used to it.
Don't worry about it.

346
00:23:51,574 --> 00:23:52,997
- Oh, my God.
- What?

347
00:23:53,453 --> 00:23:56,157
They sent me today's script.
They never send me the script.

348
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,591
- They don't?
- I'm just in a coma.

349
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,276
This must mean I have lines.

350
00:24:05,317 --> 00:24:07,298
How does it happen?

351
00:24:11,335 --> 00:24:15,013
You get thrown from a horse
into an electric fence.

352
00:24:16,936 --> 00:24:19,083
A what? Jessica hates horses.

353
00:24:19,408 --> 00:24:23,405
After this, she's not gonna be crazy
about electricity either.

354
00:24:27,618 --> 00:24:31,437
Now, remember,
you have to imagine me in a kilt.

355
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,836
I can imagine you in a short
plaid skirt and knee socks.

356
00:24:37,986 --> 00:24:40,940
- You wanna start telling secrets?
- No.

357
00:24:44,492 --> 00:24:46,568
Now, remember...

358
00:24:46,788 --> 00:24:48,864
...I'm still learning.

359
00:24:57,887 --> 00:25:00,425
One, two, three, four!

360
00:25:18,345 --> 00:25:20,918
You know the song. Sing along.

361
00:25:47,465 --> 00:25:48,853
So?

362
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:50,729
- No.
- No.

363
00:25:55,223 --> 00:25:58,769
Loosening the saddle on Mother's horse
was brilliant, Fredrick.

364
00:25:59,085 --> 00:26:01,623
And the electric fence, inspired.

365
00:26:01,938 --> 00:26:03,254
Thank you, sweetheart.

366
00:26:04,374 --> 00:26:06,806
I can't believe she's really gone.

367
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:10,663
Look around you. All of this is ours.

368
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,244
I don't think so.

369
00:26:19,682 --> 00:26:20,690
Who are you?

370
00:26:21,004 --> 00:26:22,772
What's the matter, Dina?

371
00:26:23,022 --> 00:26:25,655
Don't you recognize your own...

372
00:26:26,014 --> 00:26:27,367
...mother?

373
00:26:30,328 --> 00:26:32,961
Cut! That was great, everybody.
Thank you.

374
00:26:33,251 --> 00:26:35,682
That was so wonderful!

375
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:39,226
I think that you're a better
Jessica than I ever was.

376
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:42,359
- Oh, no.
- Of course not, but you were good.

377
00:26:42,645 --> 00:26:43,676
Thanks.

378
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:46,113
Good news. I got another job.

379
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:48,726
Great. Hey, all right! What is it?

380
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:51,193
A film in Guadalajara.

381
00:26:52,351 --> 00:26:53,881
The airport?

382
00:26:56,109 --> 00:26:57,461
No, that's LaGuardia.

383
00:27:01,224 --> 00:27:04,522
- This is Mexico.
- Oh, wow.

384
00:27:04,807 --> 00:27:07,025
Well, how long will you be gone?

385
00:27:07,312 --> 00:27:09,044
Eight months.

386
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,666
- That's a really long time.
- Yeah, but you could come and visit.

387
00:27:13,957 --> 00:27:18,156
I bet that you could own
a few places down there.

388
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:23,106
Oh, you know, I should probably
buy a place in the city first.

389
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,662
And I just got what you meant.
That is...

390
00:27:27,978 --> 00:27:30,161
- That's a tricky one.
- It's tricky.

391
00:27:32,362 --> 00:27:35,244
Joey, I really want to thank you.

392
00:27:35,459 --> 00:27:41,544
You made a very difficult time for me
a little less painful.

393
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,086
Good luck.

394
00:27:45,095 --> 00:27:46,554
You too.
