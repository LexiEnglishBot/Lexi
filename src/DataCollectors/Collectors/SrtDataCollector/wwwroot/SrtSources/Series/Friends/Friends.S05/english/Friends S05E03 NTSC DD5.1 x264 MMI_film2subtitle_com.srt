1
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:09,183
l'm Phoebe Buffay, and l have
babies coming out.

2
00:00:09,521 --> 00:00:11,989
Have you started having contractions?

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,057
Not yet. l heard they really hurt.
Do they?

4
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:17,794
Oh, my God!

5
00:00:18,964 --> 00:00:20,454
Which of you is the father?

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,691
None of them are.
The father is my brother.

7
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:29,803
l'll miss watching you
freak people out like that.

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,204
This is for the babies
to look at someday.

9
00:00:34,413 --> 00:00:37,075
Do you want to say anything
before it starts?

10
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:42,083
Hi, kids! lt's me, Aunt Phoebe.

11
00:00:42,387 --> 00:00:45,447
Can't wait to see you.
Please don't hurt me!

12
00:00:48,226 --> 00:00:49,659
What took you so long?

13
00:00:49,895 --> 00:00:52,090
Your cab left when ours did.

14
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:58,597
We went back because
l forgot my jacket.

15
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:05,099
You're not wearing one.

16
00:01:05,944 --> 00:01:08,435
Oh, man!
l did it again!

17
00:01:09,848 --> 00:01:12,112
Someone has to call
Frank and Alice.

18
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:14,581
My mom might--
What are you doing?

19
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:16,913
l've got to get the ''before'' shot!

20
00:01:20,926 --> 00:01:22,621
The One Hundredth

21
00:02:08,373 --> 00:02:12,241
We spoke to the nurse.
The reason your doctor is late...

22
00:02:12,444 --> 00:02:14,503
...is because she's not coming.

23
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:17,675
She hit her head in the shower.

24
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,342
Oh, my God. She's so stupid!

25
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:23,652
Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.

26
00:02:23,855 --> 00:02:27,655
l don't see three kids
coming out of your vagina!

27
00:02:31,196 --> 00:02:34,324
Listen. The nurse said
the doctor is wonderful.

28
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:36,398
He's head of the department.

29
00:02:36,635 --> 00:02:39,195
All right. Oh, dear God, save me!

30
00:02:39,471 --> 00:02:41,564
l'm having my first contraction!

31
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,830
Oh, it's not bad.

32
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:50,545
And so the miracle of birth begins.
And l--

33
00:02:50,816 --> 00:02:51,805
You okay?

34
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:54,143
Something hurts.

35
00:02:54,352 --> 00:02:57,219
lt's sympathy pains.
That's so sweet!

36
00:02:57,889 --> 00:02:59,754
l didn't know l cared that much.

37
00:03:04,062 --> 00:03:07,691
l'm Dr. Harad.
l'll be delivering your babies.

38
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:11,232
You'll be in good hands.
l've been doing this a long time.

39
00:03:11,503 --> 00:03:13,869
l'll be back to do your internal.

40
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:16,267
Just relax, everything looks great.

41
00:03:16,508 --> 00:03:19,102
And also, l love Fonzie.

42
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:24,939
Did he just say he loves Fonzie?

43
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:27,014
That's what it sounded like.

44
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:28,878
All right.

45
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:36,253
Am l late?
Nobody came out yet, right?

46
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:39,256
No, we haven't started yet.
Where's Alice?

47
00:03:39,464 --> 00:03:42,900
Delaware. Until she gets here,
l'll be your coach.

48
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:46,104
Don't worry. She told me
about the LaMazda stuff.

49
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:49,532
lf you get the babies out
by month's end...

50
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:51,606
...you get two percent financing.

51
00:03:56,915 --> 00:03:59,475
Monica, you're gonna be
very proud of me.

52
00:03:59,718 --> 00:04:03,279
l just got us dates with two
unbelievably cute nurses.

53
00:04:03,488 --> 00:04:04,887
Oh, my!

54
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:08,055
They're male nurses.

55
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,221
Not in my head.

56
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:14,956
They want to take us out
Saturday night! What do you say?

57
00:04:20,272 --> 00:04:21,671
l don't think so.

58
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:23,974
What are you talking about?

59
00:04:24,242 --> 00:04:27,973
You've been telling me
to get over Ross and move on.

60
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,273
l'm moving on and so are you.

61
00:04:30,482 --> 00:04:31,972
Why don't you want to go?

62
00:04:34,452 --> 00:04:37,012
Why don't you give me
a good reason...

63
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:39,587
...and l'll tell you if it's true.

64
00:04:41,293 --> 00:04:44,194
-What?
-Harder than it sounds, isn't it?

65
00:04:44,863 --> 00:04:47,331
You're coming.
And when they get off...

66
00:04:47,632 --> 00:04:49,862
...we'll go get some Jello with them.

67
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:53,632
There's always room for Jello.

68
00:04:57,108 --> 00:04:59,042
How do you make that dirty?

69
00:04:59,277 --> 00:05:01,837
lt's easy.
l can do it with anything.

70
00:05:02,814 --> 00:05:05,647
Grandma's chicken salad....

71
00:05:15,126 --> 00:05:16,957
Get a shot of this.

72
00:05:17,662 --> 00:05:20,460
These are the headlines
when you were born.

73
00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:24,396
Now, girl baby, turn away.
And boy babies...

74
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:26,330
...check it out!

75
00:05:27,205 --> 00:05:29,730
This is what naked women
looked like when you were born.

76
00:05:29,975 --> 00:05:32,569
Now let's dive into the good stuff.

77
00:05:34,012 --> 00:05:36,537
Okay, l'm having another one!

78
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:39,683
This one doesn't hurt eith--
Yes, it does!

79
00:05:45,423 --> 00:05:47,414
l was kind of hoping that was it.

80
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:52,391
Where are Monica and Rachel, anyway?

81
00:05:52,597 --> 00:05:55,065
A couple of nurses asked them out.

82
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:57,234
Really? Male nurses?

83
00:05:57,435 --> 00:05:59,426
Yeah, l was bummed too.

84
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:02,604
So they're going on dates.

85
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:05,503
-When?
-l think Saturday.

86
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:09,673
-What's with him?
-Sympathy pains.

87
00:06:10,115 --> 00:06:14,449
lt was sweet at first, but now l think
he's trying to steal my thunder.

88
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:18,947
Let's see what we got here.

89
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:22,784
Oh, you know, Fonzie dated triplets.

90
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:27,295
This Fonzie person
you keep referring to...

91
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:29,624
...is that another doctor?

92
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:30,925
Oh, no, no.

93
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:33,867
Fonzie is the nickname
of Arthur Fonzerelli.

94
00:06:35,273 --> 00:06:36,297
The Fonz.

95
00:06:39,077 --> 00:06:40,066
All right.

96
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:46,413
lt's not that weird, is it?

97
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:48,375
lt's very weird!

98
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:53,250
l don't want some guy down there
telling me l'm ''dilated-a-mundo.''

99
00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:58,460
He doesn't seem to be
impersonating Fonzie--

100
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,822
What are you doing?

101
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:04,565
Why are you defending him?
Just get me another doctor...

102
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:06,794
...who isn't crazy
and doesn't Fonzie!

103
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:08,564
Again, it's not--

104
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:18,081
Hey, there you are!

105
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,414
There's something you should know.

106
00:07:20,618 --> 00:07:23,610
ls this about you dating the nurse?
Joey told me.

107
00:07:23,855 --> 00:07:27,313
l am so fine. You and l,
we're just nothing.

108
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:30,158
Just goofing around.

109
00:07:33,932 --> 00:07:36,867
l was about to tell you
l was getting out of it.

110
00:07:37,135 --> 00:07:40,935
But if we're just ''goofing around,''
maybe l will go out with him.

111
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:43,265
Fine. Maybe l will too.

112
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,202
Hey! Look what l found
in the gift shop.

113
00:07:49,547 --> 00:07:51,845
Get up! Get up! Get up!

114
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,982
This is Dr. Oberman.

115
00:08:00,492 --> 00:08:03,120
He has no strong feelings
about Fonzie...

116
00:08:03,328 --> 00:08:06,456
...or any of the <i>Happy Days</i> gang.

117
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:09,524
You're going into what grade?

118
00:08:10,702 --> 00:08:14,229
l'm actually a first-year resident.
l graduated early.

119
00:08:14,506 --> 00:08:15,837
Me too.

120
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:20,507
l should have specified
l'd need a grown-up doctor.

121
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:22,904
Really, l'm fully qualified--

122
00:08:23,148 --> 00:08:24,172
Doogie!

123
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:31,051
Doesn't anybody understand that
l'm going to be having babies soon?

124
00:08:31,756 --> 00:08:33,724
Go, little boy! Go!

125
00:08:37,562 --> 00:08:39,894
Oh, cool. You made him cry!

126
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:49,203
Mr. Tribbiani, l'm afraid
you've got kidney stones.

127
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:51,771
Well, what else could it be?

128
00:08:52,043 --> 00:08:54,011
lt's kidney stones.

129
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:56,002
Or....

130
00:08:56,214 --> 00:08:57,841
Kidney stones.

131
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:03,919
-lf it was something else?
-Well, that would be ''kidney stones.''

132
00:09:08,226 --> 00:09:09,557
You're getting there.

133
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:11,991
These babies are very, very lucky.

134
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,288
They are? Why?

135
00:09:13,498 --> 00:09:16,592
They'll be born
on the Fonz's half-birthday.

136
00:09:19,104 --> 00:09:20,731
Happy Birthday.

137
00:09:21,272 --> 00:09:23,240
Just to clarify...

138
00:09:23,441 --> 00:09:25,102
...l'm not Fonzie.

139
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:38,252
lt's a terrific thing that you're having
these babies for Frank and Alice.

140
00:09:38,456 --> 00:09:40,117
No, it is.

141
00:09:40,992 --> 00:09:42,823
Can l tell you a secret?

142
00:09:43,862 --> 00:09:45,762
l want to keep one.

143
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:52,636
Oh, l'm gonna be on the news.

144
00:09:54,873 --> 00:09:56,135
You must be kidding.

145
00:09:56,374 --> 00:09:59,002
You know you can't keep
one of these babies.

146
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,201
Maybe l can. You don't know.

147
00:10:01,412 --> 00:10:05,439
l do. Frank and Alice will
want to keep all their children.

148
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,084
Maybe not. You know?

149
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:10,611
Three babies are a handful.

150
00:10:10,822 --> 00:10:13,086
Maybe they'll want to unload one.

151
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:18,819
l hate to miss an opportunity
because l didn't ask.

152
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:23,226
Phoebe, no.
This is insane.

153
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:24,560
Just ask him.

154
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:26,464
What? Me?

155
00:10:26,938 --> 00:10:27,927
l can't ask him!

156
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:31,506
Do you know how inappropriate
that would be?

157
00:10:32,844 --> 00:10:35,335
All l'm saying is,
just talk to Frank.

158
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:36,878
Just feel him out.

159
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:40,676
No. l will not ask Frank
to give you one of his kids.

160
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:43,611
You're right.

161
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:51,094
Tell him it's for you.

162
00:10:53,464 --> 00:10:55,056
Feeling better, sweetie?

163
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,029
Maybe a little.

164
00:10:57,235 --> 00:10:59,032
Wish you hadn't seen me throw up.

165
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:01,800
Me too.

166
00:11:04,943 --> 00:11:06,410
l just heard. What's up?

167
00:11:06,611 --> 00:11:08,476
Kidney stones!

168
00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:15,742
Ordinarily, we try to break
the stones up with shock waves.

169
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:18,354
But they're too close to the bladder.

170
00:11:18,556 --> 00:11:22,583
Either we wait for you to pass them
or else go up the urethra--

171
00:11:25,797 --> 00:11:28,960
No, no, no, no.
Nothing is going up, okay?

172
00:11:30,435 --> 00:11:33,768
Up is not an option.
What's a urethra?

173
00:11:36,975 --> 00:11:38,101
Are you crazy?

174
00:11:41,646 --> 00:11:43,273
Did you ask him?

175
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:45,381
No, l haven't had a chance yet.

176
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,244
l'm kind of on a clock here.

177
00:11:50,188 --> 00:11:51,746
Oh, Fonzie.

178
00:11:55,293 --> 00:11:57,659
You know who l always liked?
Mork.

179
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:02,790
Undo it. Undo it.

180
00:12:05,303 --> 00:12:06,793
Fonzie met Mork.

181
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:09,005
Mork froze Fonzie.

182
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:17,342
But Fonzie was already cool.

183
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,450
So he wasn't hurt. Right?

184
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,953
Yeah, that's right.

185
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:28,390
How you doing?

186
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,128
Okay. Doctor says any minute now.

187
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:34,821
You know, Alice is going
to be here so soon.

188
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:39,968
You couldn't just do me a favor
and, like, hold them in?

189
00:12:41,706 --> 00:12:45,301
Sorry, l'm in the middle of
the last favor you asked me to do.

190
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:52,978
This is Dan, one of the guys
we're dating on Saturday.

191
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:55,811
Nice to meet you.

192
00:13:00,058 --> 00:13:04,017
l'm really looking forward
to Saturday night. Really!

193
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:08,529
So, Dan...

194
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:10,701
...nurse, not a doctor, huh?

195
00:13:11,402 --> 00:13:12,869
Kind of girlie, isn't it?

196
00:13:16,374 --> 00:13:20,276
That's okay. l'm doing this
to get through medical school.

197
00:13:23,514 --> 00:13:26,108
And it didn't feel ''girlie''
during the Gulf War.

198
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:27,778
Sure.

199
00:13:31,756 --> 00:13:34,452
Thanks for doing that for us,
by the way.

200
00:13:37,962 --> 00:13:40,192
Why wait till Saturday?
Are you free tomorrow?

201
00:13:40,398 --> 00:13:42,263
Sure.
l'll get somebody to cover me.

202
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:44,059
Great!

203
00:13:44,268 --> 00:13:46,236
Hey, you and me, Saturday night?

204
00:13:46,437 --> 00:13:48,462
-No.
-All right, very good!

205
00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:53,236
This is a big one.

206
00:13:56,214 --> 00:13:58,705
Get these things out of me!

207
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:02,880
Breathe! Breathe through the pain.

208
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,083
l want the drugs, Ross!

209
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:10,954
l do too! l do too!

210
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:16,991
Yeah, l love you.
Okay, bye.

211
00:14:19,303 --> 00:14:22,238
That was Alice's mom.
Alice left five hours ago.

212
00:14:22,507 --> 00:14:23,769
She should be here.

213
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:25,670
She'll make it on time.

214
00:14:27,912 --> 00:14:29,812
So, Frank...

215
00:14:30,148 --> 00:14:33,345
...three babies.
That just seems like a lot, huh?

216
00:14:33,785 --> 00:14:35,412
Not to me.

217
00:14:37,288 --> 00:14:38,312
Fair enough.

218
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:47,689
You're at ten centimeters.
Time to start having babies.

219
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:49,662
l want only the father here.

220
00:14:50,468 --> 00:14:52,231
-We love you.
-Good luck.

221
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:02,302
l need a clamp, a sterile towel
and Channel 31 .

222
00:15:02,513 --> 00:15:03,912
What is that?

223
00:15:07,885 --> 00:15:08,874
Oh, my God!

224
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,478
Oh, no, no! lt's a good one.
Fonzie plays the bongos.

225
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:15,722
Ready? Time to try pushing.

226
00:15:15,993 --> 00:15:17,824
Ready? Time to try peeing.

227
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:26,365
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
lt's almost time to try peeing.

228
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:30,699
Push. Concentrate on pushing.

229
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:32,535
l see the head.

230
00:15:32,743 --> 00:15:34,574
Yes, it has a head!

231
00:15:36,347 --> 00:15:37,609
Keep pushing. Come on.

232
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:40,113
l can't believe somebody's coming out!

233
00:15:40,518 --> 00:15:42,713
There's somebody coming out of you!

234
00:15:43,454 --> 00:15:46,082
-lt's my son!
-All right.

235
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:49,716
Here's your first baby!

236
00:15:54,298 --> 00:15:55,925
Yes! We got a baby boy!

237
00:15:57,802 --> 00:15:59,793
Frank Junior, Junior!

238
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:01,735
How does he look?

239
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:03,270
So gross!

240
00:16:06,777 --> 00:16:08,745
Okay. You ready to push again?

241
00:16:09,046 --> 00:16:11,276
l already had a baby.
Leave me alone!

242
00:16:11,482 --> 00:16:14,815
Come on, you can do it!
You can do it!

243
00:16:24,729 --> 00:16:27,323
Little Leslie's here!
We got another one!

244
00:16:28,232 --> 00:16:31,724
Oh, my God! l can't believe
l have two children.

245
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,635
How scary is that?

246
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:42,803
Come on, little Chandler,
it's time to be born.

247
00:16:43,681 --> 00:16:46,115
He's coming!
Yes, he's coming!

248
00:16:50,254 --> 00:16:52,154
Hey, where's his thing?

249
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,918
Chandler's a girl!

250
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:02,422
Oh, God! Kindergarten flashback.

251
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:07,364
They read the sonogram wrong,
because they thought it was a boy.

252
00:17:07,672 --> 00:17:09,663
But Chandler's a girl!

253
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:11,535
Okay, keep saying it.

254
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:16,002
-Am l too late?
-No, no. Everything's okay.

255
00:17:16,213 --> 00:17:18,647
There's 30 fingers and 30 toes.

256
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,310
We have our babies?

257
00:17:22,653 --> 00:17:23,813
We have our babies.

258
00:17:38,736 --> 00:17:40,328
Oh, my God!

259
00:17:40,538 --> 00:17:42,005
You did it, man.

260
00:17:43,307 --> 00:17:45,172
Would you like to see them?

261
00:17:48,746 --> 00:17:50,737
They're so small.

262
00:17:58,155 --> 00:18:00,146
-l'll call you tomorrow.
-Great.

263
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:07,430
Are you really going to date
that nurse man?

264
00:18:08,332 --> 00:18:10,664
You and l are just
''goofing around.''

265
00:18:10,868 --> 00:18:13,496
l thought, why not
''goof around'' with him?

266
00:18:16,407 --> 00:18:20,605
l don't know if you've looked up
''goofing around'' in the dictionary.

267
00:18:20,845 --> 00:18:22,506
Well, l have...

268
00:18:22,713 --> 00:18:26,444
...and the technical definition is:

269
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:30,944
Two friends who care a lot
about each other...

270
00:18:31,956 --> 00:18:34,516
...and have amazing sex...

271
00:18:37,194 --> 00:18:40,630
...and just want to spend
more time together.

272
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,558
But if you have this new
dictionary that gets you mad at me...

273
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,534
...then we have to get you
my original one.

274
00:18:51,475 --> 00:18:52,965
l am so bad at this.

275
00:18:54,145 --> 00:18:58,081
-You're better than you think you are.
-Really?

276
00:18:58,282 --> 00:18:59,340
Okay. So if--?

277
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:02,475
-Know when to stop.
-l sensed that l should stop.

278
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:04,710
So we're okay?

279
00:19:06,323 --> 00:19:09,156
l'm gonna go tell Dan that
it's not gonna happen.

280
00:19:12,763 --> 00:19:14,628
-Don't do the dance.
-Right.

281
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,969
You're my favorite.

282
00:19:21,238 --> 00:19:24,230
-Which one do you have?
-l don't care.

283
00:19:28,846 --> 00:19:32,304
Frank and Alice want me to tell you
they're making phone calls.

284
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:35,850
Did you talk to them
about, you know....

285
00:19:40,124 --> 00:19:42,149
No, honey.

286
00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:48,362
lt was a long shot.

287
00:19:51,202 --> 00:19:54,831
You guys? Can l just have
a second alone with the babies?

288
00:20:17,828 --> 00:20:19,853
So here you are.

289
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:24,698
Seems like yesterday l was talking
to you in that petri dish.

290
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:33,704
Everyone said labor was
the hardest thing.

291
00:20:33,978 --> 00:20:35,969
But they were wrong. This is.

292
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,378
Well, l had the most fun
with you guys.

293
00:20:43,654 --> 00:20:46,748
l wish l could take you home
and see you every day.

294
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,858
l'll settle for being
your favorite aunt.

295
00:20:54,732 --> 00:20:58,224
l know Alice's sister has a pool,
but you lived in me.

296
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:05,737
Okay, so we're cool.

297
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:08,875
We're gonna be great.

298
00:21:10,614 --> 00:21:12,411
Little high-fives.

299
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:24,519
Well, if you're going to cry....

300
00:21:40,878 --> 00:21:44,575
Phoebe, we are so proud of you.
You're amazing!

301
00:21:44,915 --> 00:21:45,904
l know.

302
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:49,946
Does it hurt as bad as they say?

303
00:21:50,187 --> 00:21:52,246
You won't be able to take it.

304
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:57,416
Now that little Chandler is a girl,
what'll they name her?

305
00:21:57,628 --> 00:21:59,186
They'll call her Chandler.

306
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:04,089
Kind of a masculine name,
don't you think?

307
00:22:04,702 --> 00:22:06,795
lt works on you.

308
00:22:08,405 --> 00:22:12,774
Maybe they can girlie it up a bit,
like Chandlerette.

309
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:15,478
Alice called her Channy-fanny.

310
00:22:15,646 --> 00:22:16,635
Ha-ha, Channy-fanny.

311
00:22:20,317 --> 00:22:21,306
