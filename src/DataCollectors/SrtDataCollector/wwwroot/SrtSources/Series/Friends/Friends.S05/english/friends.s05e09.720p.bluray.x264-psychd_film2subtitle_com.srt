1
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:05,879
What am I sitting on?

2
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:07,840
Top of the world?

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,925
Dock of the bay?

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,052
I'm out.

5
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,598
- Oh, ew, undies! Oh.
- Oh!

6
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:21,145
All right, whose are they?

7
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,522
- Whose are they?
- Not mine.

8
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,399
Joey's. Got to be Joey's.

9
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,280
They're mine.

10
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,366
See, Joey's. They're Joe-Joe-Joey's.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,452
Why are they here?

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,704
I don't know, uh...

13
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,458
I'm Joey.

14
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,585
I'm disgusting.

15
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,546
I take my underwear off
in other people's homes.

16
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,259
Get them out of here.
What's wrong with you?

17
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,469
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,140
- Take them!
- I got them.

19
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,351
You can touch them. They're yours.

20
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,317
Chandler? A word?

21
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,902
Yeah.

22
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:21,163
I'm tired of covering for you two.
This has got to stop. Aah.

23
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,917
Tighty-whiteys? What are you, 8?

24
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,504
Thank you, Joey, so much.

25
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,255
You're not welcome, okay?

26
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,343
Look, I hate this.
You guys keep embarrassing me.

27
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:38,097
Yesterday, Rachel found
your razor in our bathroom.

28
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:42,434
I said it was mine, and that
I was playing a woman in a play.

29
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,480
Then one thing led
to another and...

30
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,947
And around the ankles,
that is a tough spot.

31
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,865
It was. All right, listen...

32
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,535
All this lying has been
hard on us too.

33
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,329
Yeah, I bet all the sex
makes it easier.

34
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,749
Yeah, actually.

35
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,502
We'll be more careful.

36
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:12,673
We don't want them to know,
because it's going really well.

37
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,468
And maybe it's going well
because it's a secret.

38
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,222
It sounds weird,
but we're so bad at relationships.

39
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,516
- We are. Help us.
- Help.

40
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:28,105
All right. But you do it with me once.

41
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,193
Joey!

42
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,528
Didn't think so.

43
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,790
- Hey, Phoebe.
- Hey, Pheebs.

44
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,083
What are you reading?

45
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,793
Um, Wuthering Heights.

46
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:36,006
I have to finish it by tomorrow
for my literature class.

47
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,508
You're taking a class? That's so cool.

48
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,845
I really liked
that Lamaze class I took.

49
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:45,807
I thought this time I'd go
for something more intellectual...

50
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,393
...with a less painful final exam.

51
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,313
That sounds like fun.

52
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,774
Oh, you should come with me!

53
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,235
Then I'll have someone to sit with.

54
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,444
Okay.

55
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,322
Yay! Okay.
Ooh, but, do you have time to read it?

56
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,573
I read it in school.

57
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:05,702
This is going to be so much fun!
Shh. I have to finish.

58
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:10,999
Hi.

59
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,502
What's wrong, buddy?

60
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,046
Someone at work ate my sandwich.

61
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,092
What did the police say?

62
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,054
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich.

63
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,139
I can't believe someone ate it.

64
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,641
It's just a sandwich.

65
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,476
Just a sandwich?

66
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,645
I am 30 years old, okay?

67
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,189
I'll be divorced twice and
I got evicted.

68
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,693
That sandwich was
the only good thing in my life!

69
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:41,697
Someone ate the only good thing
going on in my life!

70
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,034
I have enough for one more sandwich.

71
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,787
I was going to eat it myself, but...

72
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,959
Mon, that would be incredible.
Thank you so much.

73
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,170
I still can't believe someone ate it!

74
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,550
Look, I left a note and everything.

75
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,219
"Knock-knock."
"Who's there?"

76
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,263
"Ross Geller's lunch."

77
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,224
"Ross Geller's lunch, who?"

78
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:13,312
"Ross Geller's lunch.
Please don't take me. Okay?"

79
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,274
I'm surprised you didn't wear it home.
Ha-ha-ha.

80
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,778
Want to keep your food?
Scare people off.

81
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,572
I learned that on the street.

82
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,781
Really?

83
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,326
What would you say, Pheebs?

84
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:31,621
Stuff like, uh,
"Keep your mitts off my grub."

85
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:37,711
Do you picture Phoebe on the street
with the entire cast of Annie?

86
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,216
This'll keep them away from your stuff.

87
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,055
Whoa!

88
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,683
Phoebe, you are a badass!

89
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,854
Someday I'll tell you
how I stabbed the cop.

90
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,523
- Phoebe.
- He stabbed me first!

91
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,947
The Brontë sisters were
remarkable women for their time.

92
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,533
They lived in a patriarchal society.

93
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,660
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.

94
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,038
- Ahem.
- Okay.

95
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,291
So, what is the book about?

96
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,293
Didn't you read it in high school?

97
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,546
I started it, but then
there was this pep rally.

98
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,548
And I was on top of the pyramid.

99
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,550
But anyway, um...

100
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,802
...what's the book about?

101
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,765
It's a tragic love story
between Cathy and Heathcliff.

102
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,893
It takes place on these
creepy moors in England.

103
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:39,231
Which I think represent the wildness
of Heathcliff's character.

104
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,149
I totally get symbolism.

105
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,320
How would you characterize
the theme of this book?

106
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,906
Uh, let's see... Rachel Green?

107
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,286
Ahem, um...

108
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:57,290
I would have to say
that it's a tragic love story.

109
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,252
That's sort of a given...

110
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,421
...but, yes. Anyone else?

111
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,756
Oh, oh, oh. Symbolism!

112
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,178
And the wildness of the moors...

113
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,889
...which I think, is mirrored...

114
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,560
...in the wildness
of, uh, Heathcliff's character.

115
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:21,648
Excellent! What Rachel
has shrewdly observed here...

116
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,985
You completely stole my answer!

117
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,987
Honey, that was pretty obvious.

118
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,489
How would you know?
You didn't read it!

119
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,911
What do you think?
Uh, you in the blue shirt?

120
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,210
I think that, um, yours is a question
with many possible answers.

121
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:48,383
Would you care to venture one?

122
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:54,514
Are you just repeating me?

123
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,351
All right. Let's move on.

124
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,312
Okay, then.

125
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,860
Why didn't you say
you hadn't read the book?

126
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,571
I didn't want him to think I was stupid.

127
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,908
That was really embarrassing,
what happened to you.

128
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,078
- Phoebe! Phoebe!
- Yeah?

129
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,830
Your note?

130
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,290
Amazing!

131
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,168
Not only did no one
touch my sandwich...

132
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,213
...but people at work are
actually afraid of me.

133
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,465
A guy called me "Mental."

134
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,133
"Mental Geller."

135
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,470
I've always wanted
a cool nickname like that.

136
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,391
The best you got in high school
was, uh, "Wet Pants Geller."

137
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,393
It was the water fountain, okay?

138
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,605
Anyway...

139
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,150
...people are writing reports for me...

140
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,070
...uh, pushing back deadlines
to fit my schedule.

141
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,531
I tell you,
you get tough with people...

142
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,534
...and you can get anything you want.

143
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,745
Hey, Tribbiani!
Give me that coffee! Now!

144
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,173
This was really fun.

145
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,593
I've been wondering
if you'd ask me out.

146
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,179
So you, uh, still wondering?

147
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,266
No. We just went out.

148
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,436
You're smart.

149
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,522
I like that.

150
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,441
Oh.

151
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,281
Oh, candles!

152
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,951
What is that, a blanket?

153
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,662
A video camera? Oh, my God!

154
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,038
No, no, no. Wait.

155
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:47,335
I can't believe you thought you'd
tape us having sex on the first date!

156
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,341
Hi.

157
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,470
Joey, is what she just said, um...

158
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,973
Oh, my God!

159
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,683
You're actually going...

160
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,106
What is going on here?

161
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,029
And with Chandler in the next room.
What are you, sick?

162
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,785
I'm Joey.

163
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,665
I mean, I'm disgusting.

164
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,545
I make low-budget adult films.

165
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,052
Huh.

166
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,974
You promised to be more careful!

167
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,311
The good Joey name's been
dragged through the mud!

168
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,564
We're so sorry.

169
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,274
I'm telling everyone.

170
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:56,279
It's the only explanation that
doesn't make me look like a pig!

171
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,323
No, there's a better explanation.

172
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:02,077
Tell them you had to make
an adult film for your...

173
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,537
...adult film class.

174
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,457
I like that. But no!

175
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,002
How does that explain
my underwear at your place?

176
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,672
I don't know.

177
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:17,467
Get ready to come out
of the non-gay closet.

178
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,763
I promise to come up with something.
Just give us time.

179
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,182
All right.

180
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,519
But it better make me look really good.

181
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,230
And another thing:

182
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,065
The video camera?

183
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,566
Nice!

184
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,701
Ross?

185
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,452
May I have a word?

186
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,995
Of course, Donald.

187
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:51,126
We've been getting reports
of very angry behavior on your part.

188
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,836
- What?
- Threatening letters...

189
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,963
...refusal to meet deadlines.

190
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,800
Apparently people now call you Mental.

191
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,428
Yeah.

192
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,765
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.

193
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,851
Oh, no. Uh, you...

194
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,520
You don't understand. This is so silly.

195
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:14,357
Um, this is all just
because of a sandwich.

196
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,860
A sandwich?

197
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:21,656
You see, my sister makes
these amazing turkey sandwiches.

198
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:26,953
Her secret is, she puts an extra slice
of gravy-soaked bread in the middle.

199
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,038
I call it "The Moistmaker."

200
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,500
Anyway, I put my sandwich
in the fridge...

201
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,295
Ha-ha-ha. Oh, you know what?

202
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,755
I'm sorry.

203
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,923
I believe I ate that.

204
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,888
You ate my sandwich?

205
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,640
A simple mistake.
It can happen to anyone.

206
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,933
Oh, really?

207
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:56,524
Did you confuse it with your own
turkey sandwich with a Moistmaker?

208
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,443
No, I...

209
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,361
Do you, perhaps, remember...

210
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:04,115
...seeing a note on top of it?

211
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:08,453
There may have been a joke
or limerick of some kind.

212
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,538
That said it was...

213
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,582
...my sandwich!

214
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,918
Now calm down.

215
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,254
Look in my office.
Some may be in the trash.

216
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,382
What?

217
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:26,095
It was quite large.
I had to throw most of it away.

218
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,850
You threw my sandwich away?

219
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:36,231
My sandwich?

220
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,484
- Hi.
- Hi.

221
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,277
What's this book about?

222
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,862
You didn't read it, either?

223
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:46,658
I was going to, but I, uh, accidentally
read something else.

224
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,660
- What?
- Vogue.

225
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,455
So tell me about Jane Eyre.

226
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,207
No, read it yourself.

227
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,293
Come on,
don't be such a goody-goody.

228
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,504
Fine.

229
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,841
All right. So Jane Eyre?

230
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,760
First you'd think she's a woman,
but she's not.

231
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,345
She's a cyborg.

232
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,308
A cyborg? Isn't that like a robot?

233
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,312
This book was light years
ahead of its time.

234
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,316
Sorry I'm late.
Let's get started.

235
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,987
What did you think of Jane Eyre?

236
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:29,409
Um, Rachel and I were discussing it,
and she had very interesting insights.

237
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,120
Go ahead, Rachel.

238
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,747
Um, thank you, Phoebe.

239
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,961
What struck me most
when reading Jane Eyre...

240
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,339
...was, uh, how the book was
so ahead of its time.

241
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:47,343
If you're talking about feminism,
I think you're right.

242
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,891
Well, feminism, yes. But also the robots.

243
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,147
- Hey.
- Hey.

244
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,735
Since that video camera thing
didn't work out...

245
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:08,948
...I thought that I would give you
just a little preview.

246
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,784
You're naked!

247
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,077
I know!

248
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,465
Ross?

249
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,718
Hey, Chandler.

250
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,095
Monica!

251
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,097
Are you okay?

252
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,724
I'm fine.

253
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,644
I saw a psychiatrist at work today.

254
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,062
Why?

255
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,272
On account of my rage.

256
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,069
Which, if I may say,
right now is out of control.

257
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,656
He gave me a pill for it.

258
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,367
A pill?

259
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,870
Uh-huh. When the psychiatrist told me
to take a leave of absence...

260
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,375
...because I yelled at my boss,
I started to get worked up again.

261
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,294
So he offered me a tranquilizer.

262
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,838
And I thought it was a good idea.

263
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,590
So I took it.

264
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,387
They're making you take time off work?

265
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,930
And you're okay with that?

266
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,723
I don't know.

267
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,811
It's going to be weird
not having a job for a while.

268
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,231
But I definitely don't care
about my sandwich.

269
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:30,238
It's so embarrassing! I can't believe
you let me go on like that!

270
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,864
I'm sorry.

271
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,996
It was so funny when you compared
Jane Eyre to Robocop.

272
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,208
That was not funny!

273
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:46,004
I snapped, okay?
You weren't taking the class seriously.

274
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,214
Come on! What is the big deal?

275
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,175
I thought it'd be something
we could do together.

276
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,802
I thought it would be fun.

277
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,387
Fun is good.

278
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,597
But I also wanted to learn.

279
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:01,352
People talk about what they learned
in high school. I never went.

280
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,937
Oh.

281
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,524
So you really wanted to learn.

282
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,571
You know, Pheebs,
I just wanted to have fun.

283
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,990
You know who should go?

284
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,325
I know! I know! I know!

285
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,830
Monica, you asked the question.

286
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,672
Oh, yeah.

287
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,893
Oh, my God, that's Monica!

288
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,103
Oh, no, no, no!

289
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:48,900
You get away from me,
you sick, sick, sicko!

290
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,860
What's going on?

291
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,529
Joey has got a secret peephole!

292
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,824
Oh, no, no, no, no!

293
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,826
He has a naked picture of Monica!

294
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,622
He takes naked pictures of us, then
he eats chicken and looks at them!

295
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,544
- Look.
- Oh! Dude, that's my sister!

296
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,088
Give me that!

297
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,673
Wait! Everybody calm down, okay?

298
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:17,220
Let's give our friend a chance
to explain why he's such a big pervert!

299
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,015
I am not a pervert, okay?

300
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,600
It's just...

301
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,851
I just kind of...

302
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,647
I think I can explain this.

303
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,190
Thank you.

304
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,360
Joey's a sex addict.

305
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,488
What? No, I'm not!

306
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,949
It's okay! It's good!

307
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,577
It's a disease.

308
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,122
I am not a sex addict!

309
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,790
Yes, you are!

310
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,210
That's the only way
to explain all this stuff!

311
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,170
No, it isn't. It's not.

312
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,965
Because you could also explain it
with the truth!

313
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,259
What is the truth?

314
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,261
- What's up?
- What's going on?

315
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,144
I slept with Monica.

316
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,862
Well, let's see what everybody
thinks of that.

317
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,783
Oh, no.

318
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,703
You slept with my sister?

319
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,330
Uh, yes, but it was...

320
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,666
We just did it once, uh, in London.

321
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,710
This is not good for my rage.

322
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,549
Monica.

323
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,758
Is this true?

324
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,260
Of course, it's true.

325
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,390
How else would you explain all the
weird stuff that's been going on?

326
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,018
Yes, it's true.

327
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:53,191
If it happened once, how come we
found your underwear in our apartment?

328
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,194
Uh... Oh!

329
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,447
That was the underwear
I was wearing that night in London.

330
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,990
Right, Monica?

331
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,287
I guess I wanted to keep it...

332
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,789
...as a souvenir.

333
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,752
My God, Monica!

334
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:17,048
Are you sure you're not
just a sex addict?

335
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,926
No!

336
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:23,346
If anyone's a sex addict here,
it's Monica.

337
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:28,517
She has been trying to get me back
in the sack ever since London!

338
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,396
That's why she gave you
a naked picture of herself.

339
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,065
That makes sense.

340
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,151
And the video camera?

341
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,111
Uh, Monica?

342
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:46,077
I guess I set up the video camera
to try and entice Joey.

343
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,331
But, sadly, I could not be enticed.

344
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,084
Unbelievable!

345
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,003
You really kept Joey's underwear?

346
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,714
Why? Why would you do that?

347
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,970
I'm Monica.

348
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,555
I'm disgusting.

349
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,185
I stalk guys and keep their underpants.

350
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,190
Well...

351
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,403
I think we've all learned
who's disgusting and who's not.

352
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,988
Huh?

353
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,197
All right.

354
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,242
Now, I'm going to get back
to my bucket.

355
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,913
I'm only eating the skin,
so the chicken's up for grabs.

356
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,505
You were making a good point.

357
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,674
I mean, till you got cut off.

358
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,385
What's up with that girl Monica?

359
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,470
I don't know. I didn't come with her.

360
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,017
Hey, everybody!
Everybody, guess what!

361
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,519
I just convinced Carl to give us a test.

362
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,854
Test?

363
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,898
Come on!
Tests make us all better learners!

364
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,778
Oh, yeah!
We should have essay questions!
