1
00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:09,148
-What are you doing?
-l reorganized the fridge.

2
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:12,879
See? Bottom shelf,
meats and dairy.

3
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:16,394
Middle shelf, fruits and vegetables.

4
00:00:16,662 --> 00:00:20,257
And top shelf, expired products.

5
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,527
Why are you doing this?

6
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:24,929
Because l'm bored out of my mind.

7
00:00:25,203 --> 00:00:29,003
l've already been to the bank,
post office and dry cleaners.

8
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:32,677
Dude, you just described
seven days' worth of stuff.

9
00:00:33,078 --> 00:00:36,605
Spread it out a little.
Haven't you ever been unemployed?

10
00:00:36,882 --> 00:00:39,112
l'm not unemployed.
l'm on sabbatical.

11
00:00:39,384 --> 00:00:42,251
Hey, don't get religious
on me, okay?

12
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:46,889
A guy in your position needs to be
better at relaxing.

13
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:50,583
That's why we have comfortable chairs.
Here, sit down.

14
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:54,057
Ready? Watch.

15
00:00:56,301 --> 00:00:57,893
And then....

16
00:01:00,272 --> 00:01:02,399
-So, what? We just sit?
-Oh, no, no.

17
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:05,804
We're not gonna just sit.
Watch.

18
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:12,178
-<i>Hello, Chandler Bing.</i>
-Hello, Mr. Bing.

19
00:01:12,317 --> 00:01:14,308
l love you.

20
00:01:15,087 --> 00:01:17,920
<i>All right, whoever this is,</i>
<i>stop calling me!</i>

21
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:22,291
<i>It's been 6 months!</i>
<i>It's not funny!</i>

22
00:01:24,029 --> 00:01:27,624
l can see you, Mr. Bing.

23
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:30,735
You look sexy in your new suit.

24
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:33,633
<i>Leave me alone!</i>
<i>For the love of God, leave me alone!</i>

25
00:01:34,373 --> 00:01:36,102
And that's Wednesday.

26
00:01:40,278 --> 00:01:42,906
The One with
The lnappropriate Sister

27
00:02:25,757 --> 00:02:28,021
Hey, you guys! Guess what?

28
00:02:31,096 --> 00:02:32,461
The British are coming?

29
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:36,199
Oh, you and your ways.

30
00:02:38,103 --> 00:02:42,369
Since it's Christmas,
l'm going to be collecting donations.

31
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:45,633
l have my bell
and later on l get my bucket.

32
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:49,772
l'll be spreading joy
to the people.

33
00:02:50,015 --> 00:02:52,984
Last year l spread a little joy,
but not enough.

34
00:02:53,218 --> 00:02:55,812
So this year l'm doing the whole city.

35
00:02:57,456 --> 00:03:01,859
l knew a girl in high school who
did that. She was very popular.

36
00:03:02,627 --> 00:03:06,290
lt's weird, you're starting to sound
a lot like Chandler lately.

37
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:08,262
That is so not true.

38
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:13,398
So, Pheebs, where are you
doing your bell-ringing?

39
00:03:13,672 --> 00:03:16,266
They gave me a great spot
right by Macy's.

40
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:18,909
They never give a good spot
to a rookie...

41
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:23,673
...but l'm the only one who can say
''Merry Christmas'' in 25 languages.

42
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:25,343
l lied!

43
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:28,676
Oh, my God. Here's Danny.

44
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,785
Just watch this.

45
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:37,187
See? Still pretending
he's not interested.

46
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:42,361
He's coming over.
Pretend we've forgotten who he is.

47
00:03:42,768 --> 00:03:44,167
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Danny.

48
00:03:46,505 --> 00:03:48,268
Oh, Danny! Hey!

49
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:54,603
You know Rachel. She's nice.
She's not bad to look at, right?

50
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:55,938
Thanks, Mon.

51
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:57,807
Of course.

52
00:03:58,216 --> 00:04:00,776
Do you want to go out
on a date with her?

53
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,552
Absolutely. ls Friday okay?

54
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:08,552
Friday is perfect.
She can't wait.

55
00:04:09,227 --> 00:04:12,492
On the date, l'll be able
to talk to her directly?

56
00:04:13,398 --> 00:04:14,490
See you Friday.

57
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:19,900
Okay, what the hell was that?
You know what? Don't answer me.

58
00:04:20,205 --> 00:04:22,070
l have a date with Danny!

59
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:27,974
All right, it's 4:30,
l guess my lunch break is over.

60
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,678
-What are you guys gonna do?
-lf you're going back to work...

61
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:35,184
...l'll probably just hang out.
You know, make some calls.

62
00:04:41,326 --> 00:04:43,226
How could l not get the part?

63
00:04:43,428 --> 00:04:47,228
The play was about a 29-year-old
ltalian actor from Queens!

64
00:04:47,432 --> 00:04:50,458
Well, Talia Shire
suddenly became available.

65
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:52,330
She's a woman!

66
00:04:53,004 --> 00:04:55,837
What can l say? She nailed it!

67
00:04:58,577 --> 00:05:00,238
ls there anything else?

68
00:05:00,445 --> 00:05:02,743
You'll just say no again, but...

69
00:05:03,014 --> 00:05:04,481
...gay porn?

70
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:08,818
Happy holidays!

71
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,917
<i>Feliz Navidad</i>!

72
00:05:11,857 --> 00:05:14,189
<i>Allo</i> and Merry Christmas!

73
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:16,984
Oh, thank you, sir!
Here's some joy.

74
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:21,990
-How's it going?
-lt's going okay.

75
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:24,132
Good. Let me help you out.

76
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:25,597
Oh, thanks!

77
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,941
ls that a new suede jacket?
lt looks really expensive.

78
00:05:33,445 --> 00:05:36,005
Yeah. l guess.

79
00:05:37,883 --> 00:05:39,680
Just get your nails done?

80
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:43,720
Yes, Phoebe, but this
is all l have, okay?

81
00:05:43,989 --> 00:05:46,958
Thanks. Happy holidays!
Here's your joy.

82
00:05:47,826 --> 00:05:50,351
Thank you! Happy holidays and--
Wait.

83
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:54,224
-You can't take money out.
-l'm making change for the bus.

84
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:57,026
Can't you leave the
dollar for the poor?

85
00:05:57,302 --> 00:05:59,395
l'm poor.
l gotta take the bus.

86
00:06:00,238 --> 00:06:02,570
Okay, season's greetings and everything,
but still--

87
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:04,001
Bite me, blondie!

88
00:06:07,078 --> 00:06:11,139
l'm going to give him
something besides joy. Just--

89
00:06:15,253 --> 00:06:18,279
l can't believe
l didn't get that part.

90
00:06:18,556 --> 00:06:20,717
l'm sorry, man.

91
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:22,625
What you should do...

92
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:25,419
...is make something happen
for yourself.

93
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,860
You know, like write a play.

94
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:31,625
Or a movie. What about those
<i>Good Will Hunting</i> guys?

95
00:06:31,903 --> 00:06:35,634
Be realistic, you know?
lf l did write something...

96
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:39,536
...what are the chances l could
get those guys to star in it?

97
00:06:42,614 --> 00:06:44,639
Wait a second.
l could star in it!

98
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:45,905
Or that.

99
00:06:47,886 --> 00:06:50,753
l can't write.
l mean, l'm an actor.

100
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:54,017
l could act like a writer. Here....

101
00:06:59,597 --> 00:07:01,895
But see? <i>Nada.</i>

102
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:06,596
l don't have the discipline
that it takes. l can't do it.

103
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:08,496
l'll help you.

104
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,836
Yeah. l'll make up a schedule
and make sure you stick to it.

105
00:07:13,078 --> 00:07:15,342
Plus, it'll give me something to do.

106
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,878
You'd do that for me?
Thanks.

107
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:21,450
We'll start slow. All you have
to come up with tonight...

108
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:24,119
...is the name
of your main character.

109
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:26,518
-Done.
-And it can't be Joey.

110
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,452
-lt's not.
-Or Joseph.

111
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,589
What's up?

112
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:39,793
l just saw Danny on the subway
with a girl...

113
00:07:40,005 --> 00:07:41,870
...and he had his arm
around her.

114
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,432
Honey, l'm sorry.

115
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,040
You should be.
This is all your fault.

116
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:50,512
You meddled in our relationship!

117
00:07:50,782 --> 00:07:52,477
You had no relationship!

118
00:07:52,717 --> 00:07:55,208
But l was doing my thing
and everything...

119
00:07:55,453 --> 00:07:57,512
...was going according to the plan!

120
00:07:57,722 --> 00:08:00,782
Oh, God, stop with the plan!

121
00:08:02,227 --> 00:08:04,354
So what if you saw him
with a girl?

122
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:06,462
That doesn't mean anything.

123
00:08:06,664 --> 00:08:11,192
You'll go out with Danny and be
so charming he'll forget all about...

124
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:13,530
...that stupid subway girl.

125
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:15,830
She was kind of stupid.

126
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:20,041
You're right.
l'm just going to go on the date.

127
00:08:20,311 --> 00:08:24,645
l'm just going to go on the date.
That is the new plan.

128
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:27,744
Hurry!

129
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:46,203
-How do you spell ''suspicious''?
-Why?

130
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:50,201
l think this character is going
to be suspicious about stuff.

131
00:08:54,045 --> 00:08:57,276
Chandler Bing, seven!
Chandler Bing, zero!

132
00:08:58,383 --> 00:09:00,044
You're driving me crazy with that.

133
00:09:00,251 --> 00:09:02,014
-l'll stop.
-Don't stop.

134
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:05,882
Move the bowl further away.
Ross could make that shot.

135
00:09:11,396 --> 00:09:14,763
Well, you suck. But at least you suck
at a man's game now.

136
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:17,897
-Want to play?
-l can't play games.

137
00:09:18,103 --> 00:09:22,403
Ross'll be home soon. l have to write
five pages to stick to his schedule.

138
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,235
So play for 30 minutes,
then write until he gets home.

139
00:09:26,978 --> 00:09:27,967
All right.

140
00:09:29,314 --> 00:09:31,942
But listen, what do you say we...

141
00:09:32,217 --> 00:09:33,912
...crank it up a notch?

142
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:35,308
l'm intrigued.

143
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:39,147
All right. All we need
is a little lighter fluid.

144
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,484
But be careful.
l want our security deposit back.

145
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,560
We said goodbye to that
when we invented hammer darts.

146
00:09:47,298 --> 00:09:51,166
Do you even remember which part
of the wall is not spackle?

147
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,140
Thank you! Happy holiday.

148
00:10:00,411 --> 00:10:03,505
No, that's trash, young lady.
You can't--

149
00:10:03,748 --> 00:10:06,945
Stop that young lady!
She donated trash!

150
00:10:11,022 --> 00:10:13,013
The charity's on fire!

151
00:10:13,258 --> 00:10:15,590
Help!
Thank you. l need that!

152
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:18,824
What is this?

153
00:10:18,963 --> 00:10:21,591
lt's 9:00 in the morning!

154
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:25,158
All right. ''A room.

155
00:10:25,436 --> 00:10:27,961
A man enters. He looks suspicious.''

156
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,234
That's it?

157
00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:38,273
You're supposed to
have five pages done by now...

158
00:10:38,483 --> 00:10:40,678
...including an exciting incident.

159
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,316
What is all this?
''The Official Rulebook of Fireball.''

160
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:50,154
That's the game we played.

161
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:54,798
lt's great. You take a
tennis ball, a bowl and lighter--

162
00:10:57,669 --> 00:11:01,070
This is helping your career?
You wanted to be an actor.

163
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:04,570
Not the creator of
''Crazy Lawsuit Game.''

164
00:11:04,842 --> 00:11:07,037
You're right.
l'll get back to work.

165
00:11:07,312 --> 00:11:10,873
Shame on you! You should know better!
Joey needs to work.

166
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:13,016
Now come on.

167
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:17,684
You can have this back
when the five pages are done.

168
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:32,365
-l had a nice time tonight.
-So did l.

169
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,437
l'm really glad Monica asked us out.

170
00:11:44,349 --> 00:11:47,341
l'd love to ask you in,
but my sister's visiting.

171
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:50,885
-l think she's asleep on the couch.
-Your sister?

172
00:11:51,122 --> 00:11:53,556
Your sister's asleep on the couch?

173
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:58,955
l saw you with her on the subway
and now she's asleep on the couch!

174
00:12:00,265 --> 00:12:03,200
-l thought l heard you.
-Hey, great, you're up.

175
00:12:03,468 --> 00:12:05,527
Rachel, my sister Krista.

176
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,930
Nice to meet you.

177
00:12:07,205 --> 00:12:10,038
l wish you'd warned me.
l'd have fixed myself up.

178
00:12:10,308 --> 00:12:13,141
-Like it would help.
-You are so bad.

179
00:12:13,378 --> 00:12:14,436
-You are.
-You are.

180
00:12:14,712 --> 00:12:17,112
-You are.
-You are!

181
00:12:17,382 --> 00:12:18,815
You are so dead.

182
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,211
l'm gonna get you.
Come here!

183
00:12:30,228 --> 00:12:32,321
lt's very nice to meet you.

184
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:41,170
Nobody!
Nobody respects the bucket!

185
00:12:41,706 --> 00:12:44,869
You wouldn't believe
what people put in here!

186
00:12:45,076 --> 00:12:48,170
Does this look like a
garbage can to you?

187
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:50,574
Does it look like an ashtray?

188
00:12:50,782 --> 00:12:52,943
Does it look like a urinal?

189
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:59,120
-So you going back out there?
-Yeah, but l won't take any more crap.

190
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,790
No more Mrs. Nice Bucket.

191
00:13:03,594 --> 00:13:06,358
Good. You're tough.
You lived on the street.

192
00:13:06,564 --> 00:13:09,032
l'll go back to being
Street Phoebe.

193
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:15,429
But not totally back. Street Phoebe
wouldn't be friends with you guys.

194
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,601
Can l ask you guys something?

195
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:26,578
l don't have brothers, so l don't know,
but did you guys wrestle?

196
00:13:26,784 --> 00:13:28,411
-Oh, yeah.
-All the time.

197
00:13:28,653 --> 00:13:31,383
ln fact, l was undefeated.

198
00:13:32,557 --> 00:13:34,889
Well, you weighed 200 pounds.

199
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:38,921
Still, l was quick as a cat.

200
00:13:40,164 --> 00:13:42,428
l met Danny's sister yesterday.

201
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:45,966
-That was the girl on the subway.
-You're kidding.

202
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,434
They were very, you know...

203
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,330
...wrestle-y.

204
00:13:50,608 --> 00:13:52,803
But l guess that's normal?

205
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:54,908
We don't wrestle now.

206
00:13:57,181 --> 00:13:59,672
Not since l got too
strong for you.

207
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:02,810
Too strong for me?

208
00:14:03,087 --> 00:14:04,850
You wanna go right now?

209
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,653
l'll take you right now, buddy!
You wanna go?

210
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:11,117
Oh, fine.

211
00:14:13,464 --> 00:14:14,658
Ready?

212
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:16,764
Wrestle!

213
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:22,939
Okay, you know what?

214
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:25,701
Actually, that helps a lot.
Thanks.

215
00:14:30,681 --> 00:14:33,673
Let's go!
The puck drops in 20 minutes!

216
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:35,382
Joey's not going.

217
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,884
l didn't finish my five pages.

218
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:40,818
Finish them tomorrow.

219
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,650
Tomorrow he's redoing
yesterday's pages.

220
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:47,456
Yesterday's pages
did not reflect my best work.

221
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:51,867
Cut him some slack. lf he relaxes,
he'll get some work done.

222
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:55,628
l think he's been relaxing enough,
thanks to you...

223
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:57,169
...and Fireball.

224
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:02,669
lf you think Fireball's relaxing,
you've never played.

225
00:15:03,147 --> 00:15:05,638
You're doing this
because you're bored.

226
00:15:05,883 --> 00:15:08,010
lt's not his fault
you're unemployed.

227
00:15:08,252 --> 00:15:10,880
l am not unemployed.
l'm on sabbatical!

228
00:15:11,923 --> 00:15:13,515
Guys, don't fight.

229
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:17,194
And l'm doing this because
l am Joey's friend.

230
00:15:17,428 --> 00:15:20,397
lf you were a friend,
you'd be doing the same.

231
00:15:20,665 --> 00:15:22,826
So being a friend means
being a jerk?

232
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:26,230
lf it does, then you're
an amazing friend of mine.

233
00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:29,262
Let's settle this
over a game of Fireball.

234
00:15:29,507 --> 00:15:34,171
-l'll unhook the smoke detectors.
-Let's settle this right now.

235
00:15:34,412 --> 00:15:37,677
There. Now no one's going
to the game.

236
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:42,550
-l paid for those!
-You said you would, but you didn't.

237
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:43,981
Oh, yeah.

238
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:53,559
We finally get
to the top of the mountain...

239
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:56,699
...and airhead here
forgets the camera.

240
00:15:56,934 --> 00:15:59,801
The same thing
happened to me one time.

241
00:16:01,305 --> 00:16:03,773
When did that happen to you?

242
00:16:04,742 --> 00:16:07,734
Remember? We were jogging
and saw that bird.

243
00:16:07,945 --> 00:16:11,312
l wanted to take a picture,
but l didn't have my camera.

244
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:14,313
Chasing the churro
guy is not jogging.

245
00:16:15,987 --> 00:16:19,252
Oh, this is so good.
You have got to try it.

246
00:16:30,301 --> 00:16:34,237
-Damn. l got it on my pants.
-Here, l'll get it.

247
00:16:42,613 --> 00:16:44,774
We better take them off
or the stain will set.

248
00:16:44,982 --> 00:16:48,179
-l want to wear them tonight.
-Oh, great.

249
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,411
Okay, bye. Oh, my God!

250
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,684
-That was unbelievable.
-See? l told you.

251
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,257
Yeah. Sorry.

252
00:16:57,495 --> 00:16:59,258
l don't believe they're
brother and sister.

253
00:16:59,497 --> 00:17:01,522
They're brother and sister?!

254
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:04,732
l guess you'll have to cancel your date.

255
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:07,394
And call their mother.

256
00:17:19,216 --> 00:17:22,879
Wait a minute. Open your hand.
Let me take a look.

257
00:17:23,187 --> 00:17:27,055
Quarter, dime. Lint?
Not interested in that.

258
00:17:27,491 --> 00:17:29,618
What's this?
A Canadian coin?

259
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,851
Get out of here!

260
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:37,227
No drinks near the bucket.

261
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:41,232
Set it down there and then
you can make a contribution.

262
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:45,006
You can leave the ''hurt bunny''
look over there too.

263
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:46,868
Hi, Bob.

264
00:17:47,011 --> 00:17:49,571
l thought l told you
to get out of here!

265
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:54,207
Phoebe, we've been
getting complaints.

266
00:17:54,485 --> 00:17:57,716
We're moving you to a
less high-profile spot.

267
00:17:58,389 --> 00:18:02,723
-Ginger's taking this corner.
-That chick can't handle my corner.

268
00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:06,356
Look, either you leave
or we remove you.

269
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:07,920
Fine.

270
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:18,202
l'll give you one pointer.
Look out for that bitch.

271
00:18:27,918 --> 00:18:32,685
-l thought we said 7.
-You know what? Let's skip it.

272
00:18:32,957 --> 00:18:34,584
What? Why?

273
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,227
You and your sister seem to have
a very special bond--

274
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:43,059
Oh, great.
That ''special bond'' again.

275
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:48,765
Why do women have a problem
with my being close to my sister?

276
00:18:48,973 --> 00:18:52,568
-l don't know, but--
-Do you have brothers?

277
00:18:52,877 --> 00:18:57,780
No, l have two sisters. But one
has a very masculine energy.

278
00:18:58,382 --> 00:19:01,909
-Are you close?
-No. They're not very nice people.

279
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:07,590
l like you.
l think this could go somewhere.

280
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:11,785
So l'm close to my family.
Don't let it stand in our way.

281
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:14,293
Well, l don't know....

282
00:19:14,832 --> 00:19:16,823
When you put it that way--

283
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:20,560
Danny? Hurry up.
The bath's getting cold.

284
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:26,140
l'll see you later.

285
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:33,682
There's some kids
playing in the street.

286
00:19:33,951 --> 00:19:37,284
Want to go give them a project,
ruin their day?

287
00:19:37,755 --> 00:19:41,156
lf they have a ball,
you could stick razors in it...

288
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:44,953
...and teach them a new game:
''Gonna-Need-Stitches Ball.''

289
00:19:46,263 --> 00:19:51,200
Hey, guys! l was at the library.
l already finished my five pages.

290
00:19:51,435 --> 00:19:54,700
Now we can go
to the Ranger game last night!

291
00:19:56,273 --> 00:19:59,367
No, dude.
Ross tore up the tickets.

292
00:20:03,881 --> 00:20:08,545
l guess without so many distractions
it's easier for you to focus?

293
00:20:08,853 --> 00:20:13,881
Also without somebody breathing
down your neck all the livelong day!

294
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:20,055
The important thing is, l finished it.
And l think it's really good.

295
00:20:20,364 --> 00:20:24,733
But it would help if l could hear it.
Would you guys read it for me?

296
00:20:25,336 --> 00:20:26,860
-Yeah, all right.
-All right.

297
00:20:30,174 --> 00:20:32,506
''lt's a typical New York apartment.

298
00:20:32,743 --> 00:20:35,678
Two guys are hanging out.''

299
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:40,038
''Hey, man.''

300
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:42,542
''What is up?''

301
00:20:44,155 --> 00:20:47,921
''About yesterday.
l was really wrong. l am sorry.''

302
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:51,661
''No, it was me. l'm sorry.
l overreacted.''

303
00:20:51,862 --> 00:20:56,231
''Maybe it was both of us.
But we had our best friend's inter--

304
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:03,539
But we had our best friend's
interest at heart.''

305
00:21:03,908 --> 00:21:06,103
''Could l be more sorry?''

306
00:21:11,682 --> 00:21:14,674
''l don't know. l am one sorry...

307
00:21:15,386 --> 00:21:17,684
...polontologist.''

308
00:21:21,725 --> 00:21:23,590
All right, Joey, we get it.

309
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:26,554
-l'm sorry.
-l'm sorry too.

310
00:21:26,764 --> 00:21:29,631
Keep reading.
The good part's coming up.

311
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:35,229
''l am sorry, Chandler.''

312
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:37,634
''l am sorry, Ross.''

313
00:21:39,743 --> 00:21:42,109
''A handsome man enters.''

314
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:50,376
''l don't know what you're talking
about, but l'd like to thank you both.

315
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:53,249
You. You wouldn't let me
give up on myself.

316
00:21:53,457 --> 00:21:54,822
And you.

317
00:21:55,092 --> 00:21:57,060
You co-created Fireball.''

318
00:21:58,996 --> 00:22:00,486
''The End.''

319
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,926
This took you all day?

320
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:07,069
No, this took five minutes.

321
00:22:07,304 --> 00:22:12,139
l spent the rest of the day coming up
with new Ultimate Fireball!

322

lt's a typical New York apartment.
Two girls are just hanging out. Go.

-''Hi, how are you doing, Kelly?''
-''l'm doing just fine.

God, Tiffany, you smell so great.''

''lt's my new perfume.

Why don't you come closer where
you can really appreciate it?''

327
00:22:41,138 --> 00:22:43,732
-Joey, you are sick.
-This is disgusting.

328
00:22:43,941 --> 00:22:45,875
l'm not reading this.

00:22:46,076 --> 00:22:50,137
Wait, wait, wait!
