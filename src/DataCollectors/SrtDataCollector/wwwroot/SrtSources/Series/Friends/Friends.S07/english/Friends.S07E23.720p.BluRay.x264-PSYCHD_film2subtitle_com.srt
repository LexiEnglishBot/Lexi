1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:06,547
Do you realize this is the last time
we'll be here in the coffeehouse...

2
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,340
...as six single people?

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,510
What's happening to the coffeehouse?

4
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,512
Oh! Okay.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,726
From now on, it's you four
and me and the missus.

6
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:22,479
The little woman. The wife.
The old ball and chain.

7
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,983
- Old?
- The young, hot ball and chain.

8
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:28,736
- Much better.
- We gotta go.

9
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,488
- Where?
- Get the dress and lunch with mom.

10
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,950
Joey, you too?

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,369
I just heard "lunch."

12
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,872
Yeah, I can go. Sure.

13
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:46,462
Actually, I'm glad they're leaving.

14
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,256
I need to talk to you
about something.

15
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,593
- What's up?
- This may be a little awkward.

16
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:57,639
If you need money, it's a bad time.
I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow.

17
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,100
No, it's not that.

18
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,438
I'm not gonna say this
as your friend...

19
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,066
...but as Monica's older brother.

20
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:10,736
- But you're still my friend?
- Not for a few minutes.

21
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:15,115
- Right now, are you still my best man?
- No.

22
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,078
- Do I still call you Ross?
- Okay.

23
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:26,418
You guys are getting married,
and I couldn't be more thrilled.

24
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,380
But as Monica's older brother,
I have to tell you this:

25
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,761
If you ever hurt my little sister...

26
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:41,642
...if you ever cause her
any unhappiness of any kind...

27
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,103
...I will hunt you down...

28
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,022
...and kick your ass.

29
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,406
What? I'm serious.

30
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:03,413
- Dude! Stop it! I'm not kidding.
- I hear what you're saying...

31
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,333
...and thanks for the warning.

32
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,876
No problem.

33
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,130
So are we friends again?

34
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,673
- Yeah.
- Okay.

35
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:17,261
Ahem. You won't believe what Monica's
brother just said to me!

36
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,552
What you doing, Mon?

37
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:02,806
I'm listing all the things that
could go wrong at the wedding.

38
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,268
So I can be prepared.

39
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,898
- Mm-hm. What are they?
- "The dresses won't get picked up...

40
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,568
...veil gets lost,
and I'm missing something blue."

41
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,862
Those are all the things I'm responsible for.

42
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,240
I had to go with the odds.

43
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,826
Hey! You guys!

44
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,495
Remember I had that audition a while ago,
and I didn't get that part?

45
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,747
- The commercial?
- No.

46
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:27,915
- That play?
- No.

47
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,374
- That other play?
- No.

48
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,668
- The movie?
- Yes!

49
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,297
- The one about the pilot and his dog?
- No.

50
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,716
But man, that one hurt.

51
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:42,095
- This is the one about WWI soldiers.
- Oh, yeah.

52
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,098
Back then we called it
"The Great War."

53
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,352
It really was.

54
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,273
A guy they wanted backed out
and now they want me! I start shooting today!

55
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,650
Congratulations!

56
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,320
- Today's the rehearsal dinner.
- I'll be done by then.

57
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,281
Oh. Then way to go,
you big movie star!

58
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,243
See you.
I'm off to fight the Nazis.

59
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:08,830
Wait, Joey. We fought the Nazis
in WWll, not WWI.

60
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,083
Whoa. Okay.

61
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,210
Who was in WWI?

62
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,756
Go ahead.

63
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,218
- You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
- Yeah, I'll see you.

64
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,681
Who did we fight in WWI?

65
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,475
- Mexico?
- Yes. Very good.

66
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,244
- Hey, Joey. We're ready.
- Yeah, me too.

67
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,538
Richard, we're ready for you.

68
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,417
Joey Tribbiani, Richard Crosby
is playing Vincent.

69
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,462
- I'm doing my scenes with you?
- Nice to meet you.

70
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:01,842
I can't believe this. Incredible.
You just won an Oscar.

71
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,261
No, I didn't.

72
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,555
I think you did.

73
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,767
I think I lost, three times.

74
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,688
- Uh, cookie? Would you?
- No.

75
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:19,401
Okay. We're about an hour away
from getting the scene lit.

76
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:23,864
- So, uh, can you guys run it a couple times?
- Yeah, sure.

77
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,949
All right. Let's do it.

78
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,703
And action!

79
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:34,041
- We have to find the platoon!
- Forget the platoon. The platoon is gone!

80
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:41,381
- What?
- The platoon's dead! Face facts, Tony!

81
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,219
What'll we do?
We have no reinforcements or food.

82
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:50,223
There's food in the basement.
Potatoes and some pasta.

83
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,770
Hang on. Joey, you keep
touching your face.

84
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,104
Something wrong?

85
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,774
No.

86
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,359
I, uh...

87
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:03,570
I thought it might be
a cool character thing.

88
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,615
He's a face toucher.

89
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,745
I don't think so.

90
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:17,209
Let's take it back
to Richard's last lines. Action!

91
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,587
We may not have any weapons,
but we still have food.

92
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,589
Potatoes, pasta...

93
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,758
...and a few tins of tuna!

94
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,930
- Honey, we gotta go!
- Okay.

95
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,307
Here's a question
you never want to ask:

96
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:36,436
My dad just called and wants to know if he can
borrow one of your pearl necklaces?

97
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,981
Did he say what kind of neckline
he's wearing?

98
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:41,983
No.

99
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,279
I've only met him once
but I'm guessing, plunging?

100
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:51,201
He is more of a "If you've got it,
flaunt it" kind of father.

101
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,579
I don't have anything
but let me see if Rachel does.

102
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,873
Yes, include more people
in this.

103
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:02,921
Hey. Do you realize that tomorrow
we're gonna be getting married?

104
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,215
I have a date tomorrow night.

105
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:10,720
- I can't believe we made it.
- You don't have to sound so surprised.

106
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,431
I'm sorry, but...

107
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,809
- Nothing.
- What?

108
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,397
Well, honestly?
Ever since we got engaged...

109
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:23,442
...I've waited for you to flip out.

110
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,236
Honestly? Me too.

111
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,572
- Really?
- Yeah.

112
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,242
I think that something
stupid will come up and I'll...

113
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,327
...go all Chandler.

114
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,497
- But nothing has.
- I'm so glad.

115
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,500
Thank you for staying
so calm during this.

116
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,961
It's made me stay calm.

117
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,214
- I could've been worse.
- Okay.

118
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,425
I'll be right there.

119
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,476
Hi, if you're calling before Saturday...

120
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,186
...you've reached Monica and Chandler.

121
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:03,815
But if you're calling after Saturday,
you've reached Mr. And Mrs. Bing.

122
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:07,277
Please leave a message for
the Bings!

123
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,837
- Maureen!
- Hi.

124
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:30,634
- Gosh. This is my cousin, Maureen.
- We're the Bings.

125
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,598
Hi! You guys look so beautiful.

126
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,558
Mr. And Mrs. Bing!

127
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,563
Wow, Monica.

128
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:47,609
So you know, I had my
older-brother talk with Chandler.

129
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,653
- What is that?
- Well, I...

130
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,531
I told him that if he ever hurt you...

131
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,618
...I would hunt him down
and kick his ass.

132
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,958
What is the matter with everybody?
I'm serious.

133
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,460
I would kick his ass!

134
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,340
Ross, please, my makeup!

135
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,218
Hi.

136
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,970
- Chandler.
- Mom.

137
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,764
Thanks for wearing... something.

138
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:24,896
Ohh. This is so exciting! I thought we
screwed you up too much for this.

139
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,069
Just think, soon there will be
lots of little Bings.

140
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:39,327
I can't believe I have to go back to work
after this and get spit on again.

141
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,998
You're lucky. At least the people
who spit on you are famous.

142
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,335
- Who spits on you?
- I don't wanna talk about work.

143
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,592
Mrs. Bing? These are my parents,
Judy and Jack Geller.

144
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,637
- It's lovely to meet you.
- Are you his mother or father?

145
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,598
Jack!

146
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,184
What? I've never seen one before.

147
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,729
Dad, there's Ross.
Go talk to him.

148
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:09,190
I didn't even have a chance to act
as if I'm okay with it.

149
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,487
Hello, all.

150
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,532
Hi... Dad.

151
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,369
Hi, Mr. Bing.

152
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,957
- Nora.
- Charles.

153
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,587
- It's so great to see you both here.
- Yes.

154
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:34,507
Although we may be seeing
too much of some people.

155
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,555
Aren't you too old
to wear a dress like that?

156
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,934
Don't you have too much penis
to wear a dress like that?

157
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,355
Oh, my God.

158
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,693
Of course you can kick his ass, son.

159
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:57,447
You could kick anyone's ass
you want to.

160
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,992
Thanks, you guys.

161
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,747
- Rach, Rach?
- Yeah?

162
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:10,001
Do me a favor. Talk to Chandler's dad
and keep him away from Chandler's mom.

163
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:14,547
- Yeah, but I don't know what he looks like.
- He is the man in a black dress.

164
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,642
Hi. I'm Rachel, a friend of
Monica and Chandler's.

165
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,978
- I'm Amanda.
- Oh, I get it.

166
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,482
"A man, duh!"

167
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,239
Could I have your attention?

168
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,577
- I'm Ross Geller.
- Dr. Ross Geller.

169
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:49,582
Dad, please. As I was saying...

170
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,502
...I'm Dr. Ross Geller.

171
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,880
Uh, and I'm the best man.

172
00:11:56,048 --> 00:12:00,510
And this marriage
is doubly special for me...

173
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,848
...um, because not only is the groom
my best friend...

174
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:09,602
...but, uh, the bride is my little sister.

175
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,107
She's the greatest sister
a guy could ask for.

176
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,361
Please join me in raising a glass...

177
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,449
...to the couple we're
here to celebrate.

178
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,077
- To the Bings.
- To the Bings!

179
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,296
I'm gonna steam my dress.

180
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,299
Who will make sure nothing
happens to it?

181
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,302
- I'll do it.
- Who wants it? Anybody?

182
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,221
- I said I'll do it.
- Nobody?

183
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:49,517
- All right, I'll do it myself.
- I'm not gonna screw it up.

184
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:53,354
You're right. I'm sorry.
You were a big help tonight.

185
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,192
And thanks for putting my grandmother
in the cab to get to the hotel.

186
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,487
- Of course! That's what I'm here for.
- Okay. Sorry.

187
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:03,072
Ugh! Pssh.

188
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,033
What grandmother?

189
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:12,832
- Where have you been?
- Taking my parents to the hotel.

190
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,168
- Going back to work?
- Yeah.

191
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:19,005
- Nice shades.
- If I wear these in my scenes...

192
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,633
...I won't get spit in my eyes.

193
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:27,764
And, if I remember correctly, Ray-Ban
was the official sponsor of WWI.

194
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,351
Great! All right!

195
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,478
- I'll see you later.
- All right.

196
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:37,065
- Where's Chandler?
- I think he's in Rachel's room. See you.

197
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:46,241
Chandler?

198
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,300
- Hey.
- Hi.

199
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,720
- Is Monica here?
- She's steaming her dress. Why?

200
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,558
- I think Chandler's gone.
- What?

201
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,437
- He left that.
- "Tell Monica I'm sorry."

202
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,065
Oh, my God.

203
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,109
What's up?

204
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,530
"Tell Monica I'm sorry."

205
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,867
Tell her yourself.

206
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,334
Oh, my God.
Chandler just left, though?

207
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,170
Maybe it's not what we think.
Maybe it's:

208
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:45,216
"Tell Monica I'm sorry
I drank the last of the milk."

209
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:51,097
Or maybe he was writing to tell
her that he's changed his name:

210
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,058
"Tell Monica, I'm Sorry."

211
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:01,065
- It means he freaked out and left!
- Don't be so negative!

212
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:06,905
Good God, isn't it possible that
"Sorry" is sitting in there right now?

213
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:12,035
Phoebe, I think Ross is right.
What are we gonna do?

214
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,872
I'm gonna have to go find him
and bring him back.

215
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,709
You make sure Monica
does not find out, okay?

216
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,087
But, if you don't find him
and bring him back...

217
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,425
...I am gonna hunt you down
and kick your ass!

218
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,179
I will find him.

219
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:37,727
Joey? Can you
go through these lines with me?

220
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,980
Oh, man, they just re-did my makeup.

221
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,568
- Just the last two pages.
- All right.

222
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,616
I found the picture!

223
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,744
Picture? What picture?

224
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:58,081
The picture of my wife!
I found it in your pack!

225
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,416
Could you lower the script?

226
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,877
I don't want to.

227
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:07,340
I need to see your face so
I can play off your reaction.

228
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,968
Okay, look.

229
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:14,931
I know you're great
and play all those Shakespeare guys...

230
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,725
...but you're spitting
all over me, man.

231
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,562
- Of course I am!
- You know you've been spitting?

232
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,065
That's what real actors do.

233
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,736
Enunciation is the mark
of a good actor.

234
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,198
And when you enunciate, you spit!

235
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,911
Wow. Didn't know that.

236
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,080
Thanks. Okay, check it out.

237
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,876
Picture? What picture?

238
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:56,389
- Have you seen Chandler?
- No, I haven't seen him.

239
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,684
- Damn.
- He's getting married tomorrow, right?

240
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,645
Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine.

241
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,190
- See you at the wedding.
- I wasn't invited.

242
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:11,195
Then we'll see you
the day after tomorrow.

243
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,658
Mom? Dad?

244
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,202
What are you doing here?

245
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,914
You kids talk about this place so much,
we thought we'd see what the fuss is all about.

246
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,835
- I see why the girls like coming here.
- Why?

247
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,796
The sexy blond behind the counter.

248
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:38,389
- Gunther?
- She just added him to her list.

249
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:43,102
- Your list?
- Of people we're allowed to sleep...

250
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,938
I know what the list is.

251
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,733
Sit down, have a cup of joe.

252
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,487
I can't, I'm sorry.

253
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,157
If you see Chandler,
tell him I'm looking for him.

254
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,869
And if you see Rita Moreno,
let her know I'm looking for her.

255
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,585
Action!

256
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,799
I found the picture!

257
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,426
What picture?

258
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,597
A picture of my wife, in your pack!

259
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,934
You went through my personal property?

260
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,814
Why do you have a picture of Paulette
in your pack?

261
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:34,403
Because, Vincent, we were lovers...

262
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,532
...for two years!

263
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,451
Cut! Wonderful!

264
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,705
Great scene, huh?

265
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,584
You were awesome.
In that last speech, you soaked me.

266
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,255
- Tomorrow's call sheet.
- I'm not working tomorrow.

267
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,550
- You are now.
- No, you gotta get me out of it.

268
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,052
I have plans. Important plans!

269
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:10,189
- Still no word from Chandler.
- Oh, man.

270
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,818
But they found the grandmother
wandering down 5th.

271
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,363
Okay, well there's one down.

272
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,700
I'm getting married today!

273
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:28,207
I cracked a rib, but I don't care.
Today's my wedding!

274
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,960
My day is finally here!

275
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,340
She might not even notice he's gone.

276
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,303
I'm gonna start getting ready!

277
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:46,142
We can't let her start getting ready.
This is too awful!

278
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,478
She'll be in the gown,
and he won't show up.

279
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,607
Then she'll
have to take off the gown...

280
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:55,484
Stop it. You can't do this here.

281
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,613
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

282
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,324
It's just so sad.

283
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,577
Pull it together.
She can't see you like this.

284
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,997
- She'll know something's wrong.
- I know. I know.

285
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,499
There's no tissue.

286
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,211
Can you grab me some toilet paper?

287
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,381
Oh, that's gone too.
This is Monica's bathroom, right?

288
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,718
- I found one.
- Okay.

289
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,306
Thank you.

290
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,391
Oh, God.

291
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,771
Can I have another one?

292
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,232
Sure.

293
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,278
Do you need some floss?

294
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,700
I can't imagine what will happen
if he doesn't show up.

295
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,452
Here's a whole bunch.

296
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,871
She'll be at the wedding waiting...

297
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:52,625
...and people will be whispering,
"That poor girl."

298
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,212
Then she'll have to come back here
and live alone.

299
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,297
- Oh, my God.
- What?

300
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:03,970
There was a pregnancy test
in the garbage, and it's positive.

301
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,681
Monica's pregnant.

302
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,686
So I guess she won't be totally alone.

303
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,527
Next time on Friends:

304
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,446
- We've gotta tell her that he's gone.
- No, we can't.

305
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,282
She's gonna start getting ready soon.

306
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,450
Can't you stall her a little?

307
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,703
I'm never gonna get married.

308
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,959
We've just got one short scene.
It's just you and Richard, and he's a pro.

309
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,045
- Are you drunk?
- No!

310
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,881
- Yes, you are!
- All right.

311
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,218
- How's Chandler?
- Great!

312
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,970
- Where are you?
- On the set.

313
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,806
This is turning into the worst
wedding day ever.
