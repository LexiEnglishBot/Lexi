1
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:08,336
Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree.

2
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:12,242
You should see the size
of his Christmas balls!

3
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,508
How much did you tip the super?

4
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:22,149
We were gonna give 50,
but we don't wanna look bad.

5
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,353
This year we made him cookies.

6
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,818
And 25 it is.

7
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:29,784
You gave cookies?

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,895
Money is so impersonal.

9
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,861
Cookies says someone cares.

10
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,933
We're broke,
but cookies do say that.

11
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,239
I can see that.

12
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:42,532
A plate of brownies told me a limerick.

13
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:49,237
Pheebs, let me ask you something.
Were these "funny" brownies?

14
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,046
Not especially.

15
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,249
But I think they had pot in them.

16
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,855
So who else did you tip
with cookies?

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,058
The mailman, the super...

18
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,631
And the newspaper delivery guy.

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,633
Oh, my God.

20
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:09,731
What?

21
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,237
You're not gonna like this.

22
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:19,074
These are cookies smashed
to the sports section.

23
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,138
He did my crossword puzzle.

24
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:25,715
Yeah, but not very well, unless
14 across, "Gershwin musical"...

25
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:28,954
...actually is "Bite me,
bite me, bite me."

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,151
The One With Phoebe's Dad

27
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,635
I can't believe
it's Christmas already.

28
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,006
One day you're eating turkey,
the next thing you know...

29
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,110
...lords are a-leaping
and geese are a-laying.

30
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:31,242
Which is why geese are
so relaxed this time of year.

31
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,745
Hey, guys.

32
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,523
Hey, Rach.

33
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,855
I got you a little present.

34
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,061
I'll open it.

35
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,156
It's a Slinky!

36
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:49,457
Remember?

37
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,932
Walks downstairs
Alone or in pairs

38
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,003
Everyone knows it's

39
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,333
Just a big spring.

40
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,775
You're still mad
because of the whole

41
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,312
Horrible list of reasons
not to be with me?

42
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,815
How about we just call it
the "unfortunate incident"?

43
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,756
Hey, Gunther.
You got stairs in your place?

44
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,826
Go nuts.

45
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:17,963
Hey, guys.

46
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,532
What's in the bag?

47
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,291
Some presents.

48
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,504
Come on, show us what you bought.

49
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,666
You know you want to.

50
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,311
This is a picture frame
from Ben to my parents.

51
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,982
Oh, that's cute.

52
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,278
Some "Hers" and "Hers" towels
for Susan and Carol.

53
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,587
And I got this blouse for Mom.

54
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,426
Ross, that is gorgeous!

55
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,825
Look at these authentic fake metals!

56
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,225
Mom's gonna be voted "best dressed"...

57
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,061
...at the make-believe
military academy!

58
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,869
Happy "Christmas Eve" Eve.

59
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,808
Oh, my God!
Where did you get this?

60
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,911
Macy's, third floor,
home furnishings.

61
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,343
This is my father!

62
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,052
This is a picture of my dad!

63
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,283
That's the guy
that comes in the frame.

64
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,789
No, it's my dad.
I'll show you.

65
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,162
I thought your dad was in prison.

66
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,989
No, that's my stepdad.

67
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:29,531
My real dad's the one that
ran out on us before I was born.

68
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,699
How have you never been on Oprah?

69
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,574
Look, see? This is him.

70
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:39,436
My mother gave me this picture
before she died. Same guy!

71
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,708
This is a picture of the frame guy...

72
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,045
...posing in front of
a blue screen with a collie.

73
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,421
It's not a blue screen.
It's just...

74
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,420
Maybe it was just
really clear that day.

75
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,557
Okay, I have to talk
to my grandmother.

76
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,431
Wait a minute, honey!

77
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,908
I'm trying to get my boss's
ex-wife to sleep with me.

78
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,472
But when Phoebe has a problem,
everyone's all ears!

79
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,685
Esther Livingston.

80
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:23,544
Gone!

81
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,050
Hi, Pooh.

82
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,854
Hi, Gram. What you doing?

83
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,690
Just updating the phone book.

84
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:34,999
Gram?

85
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,564
Can I see the pictures
of my dad again?

86
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:41,797
Sure, sure.

87
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,407
How come?

88
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,305
Just, you know, to see him.

89
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,844
Sure. Here.

90
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,950
This is the one
of your father in a meadow.

91
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:58,320
And helping a little boy fly a kite.

92
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,922
And here he is at a graduation.

93
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,121
Another graduation.

94
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,830
Another graduation.

95
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,601
Is this really my father?

96
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,335
Is it really your fa?

97
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,338
Well, of course it is.

98
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:23,512
I smell smoke. Maybe because
someone's pants are on fire!

99
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,785
In all the years we've been
grandmother and granddaughter...

100
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,317
...you've never lied.

101
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:36,024
All right, that's not your father.
It's a picture of a guy in a frame.

102
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,463
Oh, God.

103
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,392
It was your mother's idea.

104
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,034
She didn't want you
to know your real father...

105
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,171
...because he hurt her so much.

106
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,366
I didn't want to do it.

107
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,908
But then she died
and it was harder to argue with her.

108
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,179
Not impossible, but harder.

109
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:01,642
All right. So he's not
a famous tree surgeon?

110
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:10,392
And I guess he doesn't live in a hut
in Burma where there's no phones?

111
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,290
Last I heard, he was a
pharmacist somewhere upstate.

112
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,159
That makes no sense.

113
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,428
Why would the villagers
worship a pharmacist?

114
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,702
Honey.

115
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:29,114
Anyway, that's all I know.

116
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:32,742
That...

117
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,387
...and this.

118
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,817
This...

119
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,659
...is the real him.

120
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,862
I remember my father
all dressed up in the red suit...

121
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,198
...the big black boots
and the patent leather belt...

122
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,444
...sneaking around downstairs.
He didn't want us to see him...

123
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:03,113
...but he'd be drunk, so he'd crash
into something and wake everybody up.

124
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,575
That doesn't sound like
a very merry Christmas.

125
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,911
Who said anything about Christmas?

126
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,623
Anyone hear from Phoebe yet?

127
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,020
No, nothing.

128
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,691
I hope she's okay.

129
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,932
I know exactly
what she's going through.

130
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,461
How do you know that?

131
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,266
She told us.

132
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,402
What do you got there, Monica?

133
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,835
Stuff for the party.

134
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,977
Aren't you guys
supposed to be shopping?

135
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,771
You didn't buy presents yet?

136
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,710
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve!
What are you gonna do?

137
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,784
Don't you have to be
Claymation to say that?

138
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,656
I don't think the mailman
liked your cookies.

139
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,723
The ornaments your mom sent.

140
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:57,368
Maybe the mailman liked the cookies.
We just didn't give him enough.

141
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,470
Monica, pigeons learn faster than you.

142
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:09,838
Hey, Rach.

143
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,982
I think I know what will
make you feel better.

144
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,915
How about you make a list about me?

145
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,350
Forget it.
I'm not gonna stand here...

146
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:19,750
...and make a list

147
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,926
Okay, you're whiny...

148
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:25,391
...you are obsessive,
you are insecure...

149
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:26,962
...you're gutless.

150
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,224
You don't ever just "seize the day."

151
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,562
You liked me for a year
and you didn't do anything about it.

152
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,967
And you wear too much
of that gel in your hair.

153
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,172
See, there...

154
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,814
All right, you did what I said.

155
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,378
And you know what?
You're right. I do feel better.

156
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:49,621
Thank you, Ross.

157
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:59,858
Yeah, in Albany. Could I have
the number of Frank Buffay?

158
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,595
Okay. In Ithaca?

159
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,205
All right, Saratoga?

160
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,433
Oneonta?

161
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:14,076
You know what? You shouldn't
call yourself Information!

162
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,014
Hello, Grandma. If that is,
in fact, your real name.

163
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,984
Come on now, Pooh.
Don't still be mad at me.

164
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,158
- How's it going?
- Not so good.

165
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:36,724
Upstate's pretty big.
He's pretty small. You do the math.

166
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,436
Well, I think you're
better off without him.

167
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,366
Oh, honey, I know he's your daddy.

168
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,737
But to me, he's still
the irresponsible creep...

169
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,506
...who locked up your mom
and stole her Gremlin.

170
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:56,182
I know. I just wanted to know
who he was, you know?

171
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,689
Yeah, I know.

172
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:06,488
I wasn't completely honest with you
when I said I didn't know...

173
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,962
...exactly where he lived.

174
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,927
What do you mean?

175
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,163
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive
in Middletown.

176
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:20,068
If you hit the Dairy Queen,
you've gone too far.

177
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,143
You can take my cab.

178
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,117
Thank you.

179
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,053
- Nobody else drives that cab.
- Got it.

180
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,716
I'm gonna see my dad!

181
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,224
Thank you.

182
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,556
Wish me luck, Grandpa.

183
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,102
Phoebe here with the cab yet?

184
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,438
Yeah, she brought the invisible cab.

185
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:56,875
Hop in!

186
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,378
She'd better get here.
The stores close at 7.

187
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,383
It'll be two hours
to Phoebe's dad's house...

188
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,681
...they'll meet, chat,
swap life stories.

189
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,888
We'll have plenty of time.

190
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,261
Hey, here she comes!

191
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:22,933
Can you believe this?

192
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,243
In, like, two hours
I'm gonna have a dad.

193
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,778
Yeah, big stuff!

194
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,409
Okay, let's go!

195
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,583
Here, you have to hold this.

196
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,953
"Brake, left. Gas, right"?

197
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,221
That's my cheat sheet.

198
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,894
- Where's my seat belt?
- There isn't one.

199
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,430
The paramedics had to cut through it.

200
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,378
Come on, just tell me.
Please, please!

201
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:08,551
For the 16th time:
No, I do not think you're obsessive!

202
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,152
- It's hot in here!
- Rach, get the heat.

203
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,620
Ross, turn the heat down, please?

204
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,289
The difference between obsessive

205
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:19,621
Ross, the heat!

206
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:23,824
Okay! Heat, heat, heat!
And I'm the obsessive one?

207
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,003
This way is on.

208
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,470
So this is...

209
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,102
...off.

210
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,942
Did you just break the radiator?

211
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,846
No, I was turning the knob and...

212
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,777
...here it is.

213
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,456
Well, put it back!

214
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,355
It won't go back.

215
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,653
I'll call the super.

216
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,261
Here, let me try.

217
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,957
That's right. I forgot about
your ability to fuse metal.

218
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,697
Hey, it's Funny's cousin...

219
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:00,963
...Not Funny!

220
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,735
Hi, Mr. Treeger?

221
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,873
It's Rachel Greene from upstairs.

222
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,169
Yes, somebody broke our knob
on the radiator...

223
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,712
...and it's really hot in here.

224
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,342
Yes, it's hot enough
to bake cookies.

225
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,287
Could we have a new one by 6?

226
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,390
Tuesday?
We can't wait until Tuesday.

227
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,219
We're having a party tonight.

228
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:25,963
Okay, tip the man.

229
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,496
If he doesn't like
our cookies, too bad.

230
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:29,928
I won't be blackmailed.

231
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,431
Look, if it gets a little warm...

232
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,363
...it can be a theme party.

233
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,370
Here's a theme:
"Come on in, live like bacon!"

234
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:41,972
This is it!

235
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:43,303
Seventy-four.

236
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,013
So that's what this is for!

237
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,183
This is it.
I'm gonna meet my dad.

238
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,752
This is like
the biggest thing ever.

239
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,994
Sure is.

240
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,856
Here I go. I'm going in.

241
00:14:59,131 --> 00:14:59,927
All right!

242
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,824
Good luck, Pheebs.

243
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,126
Here I go.

244
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,506
Here I go.

245
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,641
I'm going.

246
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,615
Welcome to our tropical
Christmas party.

247
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,385
Put your coats, sweaters,
pants and shirts in the bedroom.

248
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,367
It's hard to tell
because I'm sweating...

249
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,627
...but I use exactly
what the gel bottle says.

250
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:46,510
An amount about the size of a pea.
How can that be too much?

251
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,440
Ice?

252
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,508
Ice? Ice squares anyone?
Take a napkin.

253
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:57,916
Monica!

254
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,093
Your guests are turning into jerky.

255
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,455
Really?
I'm perfectly comfortable.

256
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,765
Hey! Get in line, buddy.
I was next.

257
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,531
Mr. Treeger.

258
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,305
You said there was a party.

259
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,169
Well, hey, welcome to our sauna.

260
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,539
Is it hot?
My body always stays cool.

261
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,975
Probably because I have so much skin.

262
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,878
Hey, cheese!

263
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,316
Here's the chance.
Monica, give him cash.

264
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,652
Rachel, give him your earrings.
Something. Anything!

265
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,452
No, I will not cave.

266
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:38,560
I'm with Mon.

267
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,164
All right. You know how you say
I never seize the day?

268
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,699
Even though he's your super,
I'm seizing.

269
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,867
Mr. Treeger?

270
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,702
Here is $50.
Merry Christmas.

271
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,076
I didn't get you anything.

272
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,340
Here's five back.

273
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,248
No, that's your Christmas tip.

274
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:07,015
Do you think there's a chance
you can fix that radiator now?

275
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,386
No can do.
Like I told the girl...

276
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,423
...I can't get a knob until Tuesday.

277
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,229
Ross?

278
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,760
He's playing baseball.

279
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:17,593
You mean hardball?

280
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,229
Whatever.

281
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,064
What you gonna do?

282
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,402
Excuse me. I'm seizing.

283
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:27,873
Mr. Treeger?

284
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,771
Here's another 50.

285
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,444
Happy Hanukkah.

286
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:36,045
Will this help
with the knob-getting?

287
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,284
No, the place is not open
till Tuesday.

288
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,961
Am I not saying it right?

289
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,796
So you really did like my cookies?

290
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,832
Yeah, they were so personal.
It really showed you cared.

291
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,069
Nice seizing...

292
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,901
...gel boy.

293
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,483
Is this mistletoe?

294
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,112
No, that...

295
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,151
That is basil.

296
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,953
If it was mistletoe,
I was gonna kiss you.

297
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,925
No, it's still basil.

298
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:30,133
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire

299
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:36,379
Jack Frost nipping at your nose

300
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,579
- How far did you get?
- Mailbox.

301
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,447
All right, we're getting closer.

302
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,416
What's going on?

303
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,954
It's just like
a whole mess of stuff.

304
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:54,757
Like yesterday, my dad was this
famous Burma tree-surgeon guy.

305
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:58,469
And you know, now he's
a pharmacist guy and...

306
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,800
Well, maybe he's this
really cool pharmacist guy.

307
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,875
Yeah, maybe!
And I'll knock on the door...

308
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,810
...and he'll hug me,
and I'll have a dad!

309
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,644
I'll go to his pharmacy and
everyone will be nice to me...

310
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,684
...because, you know,
I'm Frank's daughter.

311
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,288
So why not go knock?

312
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:27,895
Because, I mean, what if
he's not this great-dad guy?

313
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,362
What if he's still the dirtbag
who ran out on my mom and us?

314
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:39,774
You know what?

315
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,107
I've already lost
a fake dad this week.

316
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,049
I don't think I'm ready
to lose a real one.

317
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:53,251
Pheebs, that's okay.
You took a big step today.

318
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,720
Someday, when you're ready,
you'll make it past the hedges.

319
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:02,798
And when you do,
he'll be lucky to have you.

320
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,369
You guys...

321
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,098
Sorry about your shopping.

322
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:14,210
Oh, that's okay.
We'll figure something out.

323
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,076
I know you're not going in there...

324
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:22,719
...but you think it's okay
if I go in and use his bathroom?

325
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,620
That's fine, never mind.

326
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:28,926
Cool, snow!

327
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,061
Kind of like a blank canvas.

328
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:44,266
Ho-ho-ho-holy crap,
is it hot in here!

329
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,670
You mind if I turn the heat down?

330
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:52,110
We could have used
that kind of thinking earlier!

331
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,211
So, Pheebs, how did it go?

332
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,780
Oh, I couldn't go in.

333
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,956
- Honey, I'm sorry.
- Are you okay?

334
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,921
Yeah, it's okay,
because I know he's there.

335
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,060
So that's enough for now.

336
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:07,424
Hey, it's after midnight!
Merry Christmas, everyone!

337
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,601
Oh, right! Merry Christmas!

338
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,100
The knob was broken...

339
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:17,797
...so I turned it off from underneath.
I hope that's all right.

340
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,497
Rach, these are for you.

341
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,022
Wiper blades!

342
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,495
I don't even have a car.

343
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,797
No, but with this new-car smell,
you'll think you do!

344
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,811
Okay, Pheebs, your turn.

345
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,507
Toilet-seat covers!

346
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,315
Is that what you did
while I got gas?

347
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,349
You guys!

348
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:09,551
And for Ross...

349
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,487
...Mr. Sweet Tooth.

350
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,300
You got me a cola drink?

351
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,266
And a lemon-lime!

352
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:27,176
Well, this is too much! I feel like
I should get you another sweater.

353
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,473
