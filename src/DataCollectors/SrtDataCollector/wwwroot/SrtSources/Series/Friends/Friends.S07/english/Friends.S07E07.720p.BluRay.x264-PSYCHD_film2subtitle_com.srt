1
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:05,295
- Morning.
- Hi.

2
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:07,297
How was your date?

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,883
- Pretty good.
- Oh, good.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,388
- Aah!
- My God. Sorry about that.

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,850
Okay, really good.

6
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,643
I gotta go. I'm late.

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,937
You're going to leave her with me?

8
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,189
Don't worry, she's a terrific girl.

9
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,774
Can you do me a favor?

10
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:30,404
Could you mention I'm not looking
for a relationship? That'd be great.

11
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,573
What, are you kidding?

12
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:36,201
Just casually slip it in, you know.
Lay the groundwork.

13
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,705
Tell her I'm a loner. No, an outlaw.

14
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:43,042
She doesn't want to get mixed up
with the likes of me.

15
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,626
That's a lot to remember.

16
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,962
Can't I tell her that you're a pig?

17
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,965
I'm gonna call her later myself.

18
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,425
Honest.

19
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,720
Chandler used to do it.
He'd make her pancakes.

20
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,639
He'd make extras and leave them for me.

21
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,393
I'm not telling her anything.
It's not my responsibility.

22
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,853
Fine.

23
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,523
Now, where did we land
on those pancakes?

24
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,612
- Hi.
- Hi.

25
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:15,032
Sorry, but I couldn't get
that lock to work.

26
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,327
Yeah, Joey kind of disabled it
when I moved in.

27
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,705
- You must be Rachel. I'm Erin.
- Hi.

28
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:26,919
I don't mean this to sound like high
school, but did he talk about me?

29
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,256
Would you like some pancakes?

30
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:17,261
- Come on. Why are we here?
- Okay, okay, take a guess.

31
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,222
The hot chicks?

32
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,893
Okay, okay, I was typing names
into the library computer earlier...

33
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,311
...you know, for fun.

34
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,773
And I typed mine in,
and guess what came up?

35
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,859
My doctoral dissertation.

36
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,155
It's right down here in the biggest
library in the university.

37
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,032
Wow, that's actually pretty cool.

38
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:44,121
There's also a book here
by a woman named Wendy Bagina.

39
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,333
What is that?

40
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,422
Sounds like two people are really
enjoying the Dewey decimal system.

41
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,220
We're so sorry.

42
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,268
You didn't bring me here to do that,
did you?

43
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,651
She sent the chicken back again?

44
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,989
She said it's too dry and wants
to explain to you how she wants it.

45
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,533
I'd like to meet this chicken expert.

46
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,535
Send the colonel in.

47
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:32,336
Oh, my God!

48
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,881
Lucky bastard.

49
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,468
- Janice.
- How are you...

50
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:44,806
...Ms. Hotshot-Chef-at-the-Big-Fancy-
Restaurant-With-the-Best-Chicken-Ever?

51
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,228
I'm fine.

52
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,898
Oh, what is that on your finger?
I'm blind.

53
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,359
Oh, uh...

54
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,278
So who's the lucky guy?

55
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,533
Oh, my God.

56
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,120
I am so sorry, sweetie.

57
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,248
Are you okay?

58
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,209
You didn't tell her we're engaged?

59
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,920
- She saw the ring.
- Did she freak out?

60
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,382
She was shocked,
but then again, so were most people.

61
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,967
Eh.

62
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,970
She actually has a boyfriend herself.

63
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,888
Name's Clark.

64
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,933
She also invited herself to our wedding.

65
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,810
Clark too.

66
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,938
You said no, right?

67
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,399
Huh?

68
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,111
You said no, right?

69
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,447
She cornered me. She asked me
if the wedding was in town.

70
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,616
- What was I supposed to do?
- Lie.

71
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,370
How hard is that?
"Your check's in the mail."

72
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,665
"Oh, your baby's so cute."

73
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,544
"I can't wait to read your book, Ross."

74
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,090
So she comes to the wedding.
Maybe it won't be so bad.

75
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,136
Think she'll sit quietly?
Think she'll want to make a toast?

76
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:08,140
You don't think she'll want
to sing "Part-Time Lover"?

77
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:12,811
Oh, my God. She's not gonna like
the chicken either, is she?

78
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,816
You know what? It'll be okay.

79
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,569
She's probably not gonna even
want to come.

80
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,114
- Really?
- No, that was a lie.

81
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,658
See how easy that was?

82
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,412
So you would have just lied?

83
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,039
Yes.

84
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,209
- It would have really been that easy?
- Yes.

85
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,504
Do it Saturday. We're having
dinner with her and Clark.

86
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,929
Hey, what's up?

87
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,556
- Hey.
- Hey.

88
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,517
Hey, who's your friend?

89
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,144
Hey!

90
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,688
- Hey, Joey.
- Erin.

91
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,066
You're still here.

92
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:04,696
We ended up spending the day together
and had such a great time.

93
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,699
Why wouldn't you? Erin is great.

94
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,243
And then there's you guys.

95
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,789
Well, listen, I better get going.

96
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,457
- Today was great. Thanks.
- I know.

97
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,708
Okay.

98
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,378
And Joey, last night was fun.

99
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,963
Yeah. I'll call you.

100
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,091
- I'll call you too.
- Or I'll call you.

101
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,967
- And call me.
- Okay.

102
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,178
- Good to see you again.
- Bye.

103
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,472
Bye-bye.
- Bye.

104
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,018
The system kind of broke down, huh?

105
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,523
Joey, I'm sorry. I just couldn't
tell her all those things.

106
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,525
And we got to talking, and I...

107
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,735
We want you to marry her.

108
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:45,737
What?

109
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,448
She is so amazing. You have no idea.

110
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,534
Who do you think brought her here?

111
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,119
Cupid.

112
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,790
She's so cool.
She speaks four languages.

113
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:00,168
Man, do you know what guys want.

114
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,508
Come on, she's so perfect for you.
She's sweet.

115
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,053
She likes baseball.
She had two beers at lunch.

116
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,805
My beers?!

117
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,267
Look, she's a very nice girl.

118
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,520
We had a very good time,
but I don't see it going anywhere.

119
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,147
You always say that.

120
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,233
Maybe if you gave her a chance,
it would go somewhere.

121
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,236
I'm sorry, you guys. I just don't think so.

122
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,697
- Whatever.
- Fine.

123
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,741
Hey, don't start judging me.

124
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,910
You're in love with your assistant.

125
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,873
You're sleeping with the guy
who keeps pigeons on the roof.

126
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,083
Phoebe!

127
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,377
Secret affair.

128
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,098
People are doing it in front of my book.

129
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,976
I'm sorry?

130
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:02,481
My doctoral dissertation is in the library
at school. I went to see it.

131
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:08,236
And there were students making babies
right in the paleontology section.

132
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,865
Oh, my God.
Did you get to see anything good?

133
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,284
At your school...

134
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:19,623
...was there a place on campus
where students went to fool around?

135
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,082
Yeah, there was.

136
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,795
In the corner of the library where all
the books were that nobody ever read.

137
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,131
Yes, there was.

138
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,511
Great, because people kept showing up.
I think it's like a thing.

139
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,429
Hold on a second.

140
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,933
Fifth floor, against that back wall?

141
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,686
Oh, for crying out loud!

142
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,442
- So we should go catch our movie.
- What's the rush?

143
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,362
I'd like to see the previews.

144
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,864
The candy.

145
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,577
- Oh, hey.
- Well, look who's here.

146
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,329
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Erin.

147
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,789
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi.

148
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,625
We were about to take off
and see a movie.

149
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,420
- Oh, no!
- What's wrong?

150
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,841
Phoebe, we forgot that party
we have to go to.

151
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,927
Oh, no.

152
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:15,971
What party?

153
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,098
A birthday party.

154
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,642
Whose birthday party?

155
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,103
Alison's birthday party.

156
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,940
Oh. And how old is Alison?

157
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,567
Thirty-two.

158
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:35,407
Wait a minute.
Why don't you guys do something?

159
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,285
Look how that worked out.

160
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,501
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here.

161
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:51,548
Do you know the paleontology section,
fifth floor, stack 437?

162
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,634
Well, yes. Just give me five minutes.

163
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:58,138
I just have to find someone
to cover my shift.

164
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,393
No, no, no.

165
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,645
Can I speak to someone in charge?

166
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,567
How can I help?

167
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,112
Hi, I was wondering, is it possible
to increase security...

168
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,281
...in the paleontology section?

169
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,199
I wrote a book that's up there.

170
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,785
And instead of reading it, people are...

171
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,164
Well, they're rolling around in front of it.

172
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:29,085
We are aware of the problem
you're referring to.

173
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:37,052
As far as increasing security,
I'm afraid the library's understaffed.

174
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,721
I can't help you.

175
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,765
Well, fine.

176
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,684
If I'm the only person
with any appreciation...

177
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:48,688
...of the sanctity of the written word,
then I'll go defend it myself.

178
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,691
Don't you follow me.

179
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,779
- Hey.
- Hey.

180
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,157
- How did it go with Erin?
- Unbelievable.

181
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,368
We had the best time.

182
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,535
Yay!

183
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:06,164
- So you're not mad anymore?
- No, no. You guys were totally right.

184
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,625
This was much better than the first date.

185
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,378
It was awkward. We were both nervous.

186
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,673
- Didn't you sleep together?
- Yeah, that calms me down.

187
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,677
And we have so much in common.

188
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:24,349
She loves sandwiches, sports.
Although she is a Met fan.

189
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,060
Not an issue now, but if we had kids...

190
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:31,356
Oh, my God! Listen to you talking
about having kids.

191
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,901
Oh, my Joey.

192
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,862
- Please don't get married before I do.
- Oh.

193
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,493
Oh!

194
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,372
I just cannot believe
that Clark stood me up.

195
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,082
He may still show up.

196
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,542
What are you, stupid?

197
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,338
- It's been three hours.
- Is that all?

198
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:59,926
Let's go on to happier things.

199
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,679
Why don't you tell me
about your lovely wedding?

200
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:07,684
There was something that we wanted
to tell you about the wedding.

201
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:11,187
It's going to be a small ceremony.

202
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,314
Tiny.

203
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,152
We're not even sure why we're having it.

204
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,905
It's actually going to be just family.

205
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,577
Oh, wait.

206
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,456
You two think of me as family?

207
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,421
I have to ask you something now,
and be honest.

208
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:41,259
Do you want me to sing
"Careless Whisper" or "Lady in Red"?

209
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,890
How can you say that?
The Mets have no closer.

210
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,393
- What about Benitez?
- What about game one of the Series?

211
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,104
- What about shut up?
- You shut up.

212
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,065
I love arguing with her.

213
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,401
- Be right back.
- Okay.

214
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,154
How's it going with Joey?

215
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,323
Oh, okay.

216
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,949
Okay?

217
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,162
Tell me that you like him, please.
I mean, tell me that you like him.

218
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,750
He's a really great guy, and I know
you really want this to work out...

219
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,920
...but I just don't see this having a future.

220
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,421
What?

221
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,342
But you said that you liked him.
What happened?

222
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,345
Did you just change your mind?

223
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,556
- Kind of.
- Then change it back!

224
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:33,394
I'm sorry. It's just there's no real spark.

225
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,438
Didn't you sleep together?

226
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,065
Yeah.

227
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,983
Tramp.

228
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,362
Does Joey have any idea?

229
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,948
I don't think he does. You know what?

230
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,951
Maybe you could tell him
I'm not interested...

231
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,119
...in a serious relationship.

232
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,790
You mean, like,
that you're kind of a loner?

233
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,416
Yeah, that'd be great.

234
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,504
- And maybe that you're a real stronzo.
- I'm sorry?

235
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,383
I guess Italian isn't one
of the four languages you speak.

236
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,388
- Hey. Want to go?
- Yeah, let's go.

237
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,891
- Okay. See you guys later.
- Bye, guys.

238
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,811
Hey, thank you so much.

239
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,524
Wow.

240
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,569
I guess it wasn't Cupid
that brought her here.

241
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,364
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.

242
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,040
Yes, yes. How can I help you?

243
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,001
We were just looking around.

244
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,587
Oh, you're fellow scholars.

245
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,256
What exactly were you looking for?

246
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,424
Perhaps...

247
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,594
Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings...

248
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,597
...on the Smilodon californicus?

249
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,099
- Uh...
- Uh! Uh!

250
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,434
Get out of here!

251
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,653
Meeting someone?

252
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,573
Or are you just here to brush up...

253
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,743
...on Merriam's views on evolution?

254
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:16,623
Actually, I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

255
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,547
I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

256
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,967
I'm sorry. Who are you?

257
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,386
I'm a professor here. Ross Geller.

258
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:34,307
Ross Geller?
Why do I know that name? It's a...

259
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,725
Wait.

260
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,022
Did you write this?

261
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,399
Yes.

262
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,490
You're the person
who checked out my book?

263
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:56,412
You know, you look nothing
like I would have thought.

264
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,331
You're so young.

265
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,544
Well, I skipped fourth grade.

266
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:15,640
I am very, very sorry.

267
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,897
- Hey.
- Hey.

268
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,148
Hi.

269
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:28,236
- So how was your date?
- Great. We walked around the Village.

270
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,030
We went to this ice cream place.
Split a milk shake.

271
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,949
Seventy-thirty, but still.

272
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:37,787
I'm thinking of taking her upstate
to one of those bed-and-breakfasts.

273
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,289
Really? She said she wants to go?

274
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:45,169
No, it's a surprise. It's gonna be tricky,
because she's busy at work.

275
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,671
- Oh.
- Oh.

276
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,508
Joey, look, honey, we need to talk, okay?

277
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,719
Um...

278
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,929
I got the feeling from her...

279
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,600
...that she's not looking
for a serious relationship.

280
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,312
- Where are you getting this?
- She told me.

281
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,525
She said she's kind of a loner.

282
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:14,198
Oh.

283
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,369
- Joey...
- Hey, Rach, it's cool, you know.

284
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,289
I'm a loner too, right?

285
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,752
Hey, Joey. You know what?
You are way too good for her.

286
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:30,882
I promise, next time I will tell them
you're not looking for a relationship.

287
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,550
No.

288
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,721
No, don't do that. Just...

289
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,726
- Next time, make sure she likes me.
- Well, that too.

290
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,191
Joey?

291
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,693
Yeah?

292
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,613
- Do you want some pancakes?
- Finally.

293
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,202
What are we gonna do?

294
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,454
I say we go with "Careless Whisper."

295
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,626
Chandler?

296
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,462
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?

297
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,344
Janice, what are you doing here?

298
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,388
I thought I was gonna go back
to my apartment...

299
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,852
...but I just felt like I really
couldn't be alone tonight.

300
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,112
I was just wondering if I could maybe
stay here with you.

301
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,698
Just I really feel like I need
to be with family.

302
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,912
Our kids are gonna call her
Aunt Janice, aren't they?

303
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:48,334
Please. Because otherwise,
I really don't know what I might do.

304
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:52,630
Aren't you just a teensy bit curious?

305
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,634
- You have any tissues?
- Yeah, in the bathroom.

306
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,973
We'll just let her stay.

307
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:06,602
No. If we let her stay,
she will stay forever.

308
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,857
- Kind of like your Barcalounger.
- Is that what you're thinking about?

309
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,859
I never stop thinking about it.

310
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,070
Hey, you guys?

311
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,323
Do either one of you want to get
in there before I take my bath?

312
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,536
Janice, I'm sorry...

313
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:27,123
...but you can't stay here tonight.

314
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:28,791
Why not?

315
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,585
Honestly?

316
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,046
Our apartment is a hotbed...

317
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,841
...for electromagnetic activity.

318
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,679
Monica and I have been immunized,
but sadly...

319
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,474
...you have not.

320
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,773
I'm gonna need a comforter.

321
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,527
Do you have a hypoallergenic one?
Because otherwise I get very nasal.

322
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,367
Do you have a cat?
Because it's already happening.

323
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,785
Eh. Do you hear that? Listen.

324
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,251
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
You have to go.

325
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,461
Why?

326
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,799
Because Chandler still has
feelings for you.

327
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,554
He does?

328
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,640
Say again?

329
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,684
That's right. That's right.

330
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,979
And that is why you can't
stay here tonight.

331
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,358
And probably why you shouldn't come
to the wedding.

332
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,445
Feelings. Such strong feelings.

333
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:45,660
I mean, I realize that his feelings
may never completely go away...

334
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,912
...but you can.

335
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,832
Oh, my God.

336
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,711
I understand. I am so sorry.

337
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,421
I'll go.

338
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,220
Goodbye, Monica.

339
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:08,516
I wish you a lifetime
of happiness with him.

340
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,767
Chandler.

341
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,063
You call me when this goes
in the pooper.

342
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,287
I've got this section covered.

343
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,498
Yeah, in fact, I've got this baby
to shine in people's eyes.

344
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,375
Okay, see you later.

345
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,971
I just wanted to show Monica your book.
