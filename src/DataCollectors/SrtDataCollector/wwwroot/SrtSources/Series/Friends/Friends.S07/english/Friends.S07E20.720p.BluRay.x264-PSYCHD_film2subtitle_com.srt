1
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,550
Hey, out of all of us, who do you think
will get married next?

2
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,138
Probably Monica and Chandler.

3
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:20,394
Hi, could I have
a pack of Newport Lights?

4
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,856
Oh, um, uh, we don't sell cigarettes,
but they do across the street.

5
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,983
That'd be great. Thanks.

6
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:29,528
Oh, my God.

7
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,531
Melissa Worbert. I don't think
I have the energy for this.

8
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:36,702
Oh, my God! Ray-Ray Green?

9
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,248
Melissa. Hey.

10
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,335
You've been MIA
for seven sorority newsletters.

11
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:46,754
What's up with you?

12
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,716
Why don't I tell you over here?

13
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:55,095
So last I heard
you were gonna get married.

14
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,305
Oh.

15
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,098
Poor Ray-Ray.

16
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,934
Oh, no, no. It's... It's good.
It's all good.

17
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:04,063
- I actually work at Ralph Lauren.
- Shut up!

18
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,275
I will not. Heh, heh. I'm the
divisional head of men's sportswear.

19
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:12,196
Oh, shut up more!
Are you friends with Ralph?

20
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,823
- Oh, please. Ha.
- Are you?

21
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,575
No.

22
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,829
Listen, we have to have dinner.
What are you doing tomorrow?

23
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:24,708
- Oh, tomorrow. I don't know. Um...
- You're having dinner with me.

24
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:25,918
Shut up.

25
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:30,547
I've gotta go.
This has been so great, Ray-Ray.

26
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,799
Oh, there you are.

27
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:35,469
Um, so listen, just call me.
Here's my card.

28
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,720
Oh, wow, thanks.

29
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:40,265
- Oh, you're in real estate?
- Oh, no, heh, that's an old card.

30
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,811
Um, I got out of that to do something
where I could...

31
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,855
...help people and make a difference.

32
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,649
Wow. What do you do now?

33
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,901
I'm a party planner.

34
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,530
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

35
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:58,867
Hey guys, look who's back.
It's Ray-Ray.

36
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,788
That was my friend, Melissa,
from college.

37
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,833
She seems really, really fun!

38
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:10,254
She's actually very sweet,
and we used to be very close.

39
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:14,758
Wait a minute.
She's not the one who you?

40
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,719
Who you what? Who you what?

41
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,806
- Yes.
- Wow!

42
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,517
Wow... Wow, what? Who you what?

43
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,978
Oh, it's not a big deal.

44
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,396
They were lovers.

45
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,273
- What?
- What?

46
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,233
No, we weren't. It was nothing.

47
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:35,237
It was one night, senior year,
and we went to a party...

48
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:40,159
...had a lot of sangria,
and you know, ended up...

49
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,869
...kissing for a bit.

50
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,329
So that's two of my wives.

51
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,628
Okay, so this is where the band is.
And here's the bar.

52
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:37,216
And all these pins have people's names
on them. Rach, here you are.

53
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,009
Oh, wow!

54
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,846
Why don't we just put me
with a Manhattan in my hand...

55
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,723
...talking to the cute bartender.

56
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,230
These pins aren't for playing,
are they?

57
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,192
Okay, the red ones are my guests,
and the blue are yours.

58
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,278
This is so sad.
I only have like 10 pins.

59
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,448
Heh, Chandler, relax. It's not a contest.

60
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,741
Certainly not a close one.

61
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,329
- Hello.
- Hey.

62
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,417
Hey, Rach.

63
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,879
Stop picturing it!

64
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,428
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart
is done. This is our wedding.

65
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,057
Wow.
They all look like they're having fun.

66
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,101
So where are my parents gonna be?

67
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,435
Oh.

68
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,730
Well, if this is the wedding hall,
then, um...

69
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:37,776
...your parents would be over here
at home in Queens.

70
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:42,114
They're not invited?
Oh, no, they're gonna be crushed!

71
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,783
Why would they think they're invited?

72
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,577
You got me. I don't...

73
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,956
- Joey!
- Look, I thought parents were coming.

74
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:54,209
Your parents are coming.
Chandler's parents are coming.

75
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,837
Ross' parents are coming.

76
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,840
Ross' parents are my parents.

77
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,718
Well, see, parents are coming.

78
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,056
- We should invite them.
- You just want more blue pins.

79
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,641
Well, this is just sad.

80
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:16,231
All right. Maybe I can fit them in
if I just do some rearranging.

81
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,900
Rachel may have to sit at the bar.

82
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,653
That is not a problem.

83
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:25,157
- Maybe you'll order a little sangria.
- Oh, get out of here!

84
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:34,583
These are our tuxedos. If you like
anything, we can make a deal.

85
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:39,421
Anything at all. But these are
the three that Monica pre-approved.

86
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,716
Uh, well,
thanks a lot for hooking me up.

87
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:47,304
And I want you to know that I want
you to attend our wedding as my guest.

88
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,809
I'm Monica's maid of honor.

89
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,062
Okay, don't try to blue-pin me.

90
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,192
- Well, these look nice.
- They are nice.

91
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,988
When celebrities are done with them,
they send them back.

92
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,991
- You mean, like, for award shows?
- Some of them.

93
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,161
They've been down the red carpet
with people yelling, uh...

94
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,747
..."Who are you wearing?
You look fabulous!"

95
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,418
Might I suggest watching
a little more ESPN...

96
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,003
...and a little less E!

97
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,799
Okay. Who wore those?

98
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,217
Uh...

99
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,929
- Well, uh, this one's Tom Brokaw.
- Not bad.

100
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,932
This one is, uh, Paul O'Neil.

101
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,601
Who's that?

102
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:39,856
He plays for the Yankees.
Seriously, ESPN.

103
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:43,318
Just once in a while.
Have it on in the background.

104
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,281
Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan.

105
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,491
- Pierce Brosnan?
- Uh-huh.

106
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,951
Are you serious?

107
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,244
007?

108
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:57,624
This is James Bond's tux? Oh, I have to
get married in James Bond's tux.

109
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,418
Ha, ha. It's a pretty cool tux.

110
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,754
Ah, it's not just that. I would be
England's most powerful weapon.

111
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:08,885
A jet-setting heartbreaker
on Her Majesty's secret service.

112
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:12,806
A man who fears no one,
with a license to kill.

113
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,685
Would Monica let me wear this?

114
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,860
We should really learn
how to play the real way.

115
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,236
I like our way.

116
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,405
- Ah!
- Hey, hey!

117
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,115
Chess!

118
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,703
- Nice move.
- Yeah.

119
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,622
- Hey.
- Hey.

120
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,835
I hooked Ross and Chandler up
with tuxedos. Do you need one?

121
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,212
No, I'm not wearing a tux.

122
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,508
- What are you gonna wear?
- Multi-colored robes.

123
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,260
Ooh, and maybe a hat.

124
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,679
- Huh. Does Monica know about this?
- No.

125
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,557
Can I please be there
when you tell her?

126
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,228
Hey, Rach,
you want to go to a movie tonight?

127
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,689
Oh, I can't.
I'm having dinner with Melissa.

128
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,024
Can I come?

129
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,945
I won't talk.
You'll just hear my video camera.

130
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,073
- What? What's going on?
- Can I tell her?

131
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,910
Do you want what happened,
or Joey's lewd version?

132
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,245
- Joey's.
- Okay.

133
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,663
Okay, come on.

134
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,415
I had this college friend...

135
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,586
...and I made the mistake
of telling Joey that one time...

136
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,465
...she and I, you know,
kissed a little bit.

137
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,843
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.

138
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,097
- It did.
- Sure.

139
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,602
Hey, heh. It happened.

140
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,608
Yeah, it was senior year.
It was after the Sigma Chi luau...

141
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,110
...and Melissa and I got very drunk.

142
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:53,448
And we ended up kissing.
For several minutes.

143
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,952
Which means she had a couple spritzers
and a peck on the cheek.

144
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,581
- Why are you taking this away from me?
- Ugh.

145
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,459
Why is it so hard for you to believe?

146
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:08,213
Okay. I just didn't know
that you were a lesbian.

147
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,016
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian.
I'm just saying that this happened.

148
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:24,896
It just seems pretty wild.
And you're... You know, so...

149
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,940
...vanilla.

150
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:32,028
Vanilla? I'm not vanilla.
I do lots of crazy things.

151
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,740
I mean, I got drunk
and married in Vegas.

152
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,200
To Ross.

153
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,412
If you don't believe me...

154
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,957
...just come with me to dinner tonight
and she'll tell you.

155
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,043
Okay. Because I can't picture it.

156
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,171
You should get inside my head.

157
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,969
- Hey.
- Hey.

158
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,846
Guess what I got for your wedding?

159
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,557
A freakishly thin date
with a hanger for a head?

160
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,729
Rachel hooked me up with a tux.
But not just any tux.

161
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,772
Batman's tux!

162
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,774
- What?
- That's right.

163
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:14,988
Made expressly for Val Kilmer,
and worn by him in the hit film...

164
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,699
...that Batman film he was in.

165
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,660
You can't wear that.
I'm wearing the famous tux.

166
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,495
- James Bond's tux.
- So?

167
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:26,416
If you wear that,
it'll make mine less special.

168
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,002
You need something to
to make it special?

169
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,671
Hello! You have
the most special thing of all.

170
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,300
You are marrying the woman you love.

171
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,515
Don't take away my cool thing.
Pretty please?

172
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:46,978
"Pretty please?" Not very, uh, 007.

173
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:51,358
If you were getting married,
I'd never do anything to upset you.

174
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:56,112
- You slept with my sister.
- That was pretty 007.

175
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,993
- Hey.
- Hey. Okay, good. You're here.

176
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,495
All right, I figured it out.

177
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,997
I'm gonna take 2 tables of 8,
add your parents...

178
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,833
...and make them into 3 tables of 6.

179
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,003
And I called the caterer.
We are good to go!

180
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,255
Yeah. They're not coming.

181
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,967
What?

182
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,637
They think that you only
invited them because of me.

183
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,014
They feel unwanted.

184
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:27,352
That's too bad. It's true. But too bad.

185
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,522
- If you could just call my mom.
- Oh, Joey.

186
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,816
Come on. Just let her know
you want them there.

187
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:36,444
Let's not forget this is a woman
who has sent you many lasagnas.

188
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,654
No, she hasn't.

189
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,657
Is it her fault
if some didn't make it to you?

190
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,367
What am I gonna say?

191
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:47,205
Just tell them you mixed up invitations.
No, no, no, blame it on the post office.

192
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:51,209
They hate the post office.
And the Irish.

193
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,837
But I don't think
you could blame it on them.

194
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:02,053
Hello? Yeah, hi. Uh, Mrs. Tribbiani?
Hi, this is Monica Geller.

195
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:06,641
I'm just calling to say that I really
hope you can make the wedding.

196
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,145
Apparently some of our invitations
weren't delivered.

197
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:14,649
Um, I guess there was some screw-up
at the damn post office.

198
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,445
Tell me about it.

199
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:22,824
Yeah, the U.S. Post Office?
No. More like U.S. Lost Office.

200
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,244
What are they, Irish?

201
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:37,922
Anyway, his name's Allen. And we've
been going out for three years.

202
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,092
He was my first client
when I became a party planner.

203
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,555
He was actually planning a party
for his girlfriend at the time.

204
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,307
- Oh, well.
- No.

205
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:52,937
- Ah. He was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
- Oh! Oh, that's great.

206
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,147
Mm-hm.

207
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,566
- Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
- Of course.

208
00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:00,779
Yes. I was a, um,
Thigh Mega Tampon.

209
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,657
What one?

210
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:08,161
Yeah, we were huge too.
But they had to shut us down...

211
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,164
...when Regina Phalangie
died of alcohol poisoning.

212
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,373
Ugh.

213
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,251
Isn't it a shame when one girl
ruins it for the whole bunch?

214
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,378
Hmm. Mm-hm. Ugh.

215
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,800
Anyway...

216
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,303
Speaking of drinking too much,
I was, uh, telling Phoebe...

217
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:30,141
...about that crazy night after the
Sigma Chi luau where we made out.

218
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,060
What?

219
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:37,649
Remember we... Come on, we had
sarongs on and the coconut bikini tops.

220
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,944
We went back to the house
and got really silly...

221
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,695
...and we made out.

222
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:48,243
Wow, Ray-Ray, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

223
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,119
Really?

224
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,003
Ross is Batman.

225
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,676
Well, he did manage to keep
his identity secret for a long time.

226
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:10,098
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo
that Val Kilmer wore in Batman.

227
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,059
Batman is so much cooler
than James Bond.

228
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:18,273
- What? 007 has all those gadgets.
- Batman has a utility belt.

229
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,527
- 007 has a fancy car.
- Batman has the Batmobile.

230
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:29,826
- 007 gets all the ladies.
- Heh. Batman has Robin.

231
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,541
We get ESPN, right?

232
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:44,591
How about you go put on your 007
tuxedo, and I'll make you a nice martini?

233
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,718
Actually I don't like martinis.

234
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,929
- A Yoo-Hoo with a funny straw?
- Ooh, yum.

235
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:53,892
- Hey.
- Hey.

236
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,019
I know the invitation says 6:00...

237
00:14:56,186 --> 00:15:00,231
...but does that mean get there at 6,
or the show starts at 6?

238
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,900
The show?

239
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,447
Right, the wedding. Gotcha.

240
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,950
But weddings start a little late, right?

241
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,828
Have you ever
been to one of my weddings?

242
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,207
Ah, well, it's the same day
as my niece's christening...

243
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,710
...and I want my parents to see me.

244
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:25,590
My part's in the beginning. I'm not
in the rest of the show... Wedding.

245
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,800
The wedding starts at 6.

246
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,470
Okay. I totally hear you.

247
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,431
Ooh! How about this?
I vamp till they get there.

248
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,600
Heh. You'll "vamp"?

249
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,728
Yeah, yeah, like warm up the crowd.
Ask where they're from.

250
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:43,149
In Joey Tribbiani, you get
a minister and an entertainer.

251
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,776
I'm a "ministainer."

252
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,819
All right?

253
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,031
There's no one better.
There's no one greater.

254
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,407
Huh?

255
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,410
How can you not remember us kissing?

256
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,997
I don't know. I don't remember
a lot of things that never happened.

257
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,248
Wha...

258
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:05,046
Remember, we were on the sleeping
porch? We couldn't stop giggling.

259
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,548
Our coconuts kept knocking together.

260
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,218
Somewhere Joey's head is exploding.

261
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,180
I don't want
to make you uncomfortable...

262
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,892
...but I told Phoebe it happened,
and she doesn't believe me.

263
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:23,940
I'm sorry. I mean, if I thought
it happened, I would say it.

264
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:27,568
Maybe I passed out and you did stuff
to me while I was sleeping.

265
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,405
No.

266
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,032
It's okay, you don't have to do this.
I believe you.

267
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:37,203
If you say you kissed Melissa,
then you kissed Melissa.

268
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,415
- Thank you, Phoebe.
- Okay.

269
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,291
- But she didn't.
- I know.

270
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,338
- Hey.
- Hey.

271
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,715
You carry that around?

272
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:49,924
Yes.

273
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:53,052
I find it to be something
of a conversation piece.

274
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,306
- Between you and?
- Gunther.

275
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,809
Hey, hey. Why don't we put them on?

276
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,062
Get a picture of Batman
and James Bond, together.

277
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,732
I would, but my pants
are a little tight.

278
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:10,903
A little tight?
I could see 00 and 7 in those things.

279
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:15,783
I was looking forward to wearing
our celebrity tuxes together.

280
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:20,079
- So you're not gonna be wearing yours?
- Are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!

281
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,291
Let me try it on.

282
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:28,588
Okay. But just the jacket.
00 and 7 are not getting in there.

283
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,592
Okay.

284
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,305
Holy double-vented comfort, Batman!

285
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,476
- What's this?
- Huh?

286
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,562
An invitation to
the At First Sight premiere?

287
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,855
Oh, my God.

288
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,815
Val Kilmer didn't
wear this in Batman.

289
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:52,320
He wore it to the premiere of a fruity
love story where he was a blind guy.

290
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,906
Let me see that.

291
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,867
Oh, man.

292
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,746
The only super power you have is the
slightly heightened sense of smell.

293
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,291
Hey.

294
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,210
Uh, can I talk to you guys
for a second?

295
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,754
I give up.
Whatever you want, you can have it.

296
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,298
You want to sing a song or do a dance?

297
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:16,886
You want your mom at the altar
screaming racial slurs? I don't care.

298
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:22,642
No. I just want to thank you guys
for what you did for my parents.

299
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,353
They're so happy
to get to be a part of your special day.

300
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,687
Oh.

301
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,649
Well, your welcome.
Tell them we're glad they're coming.

302
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,362
I will. Oh, check out what they got
me to wear for the ceremony!

303
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:37,949
Huh?

304
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:42,245
I wear it like this when I
marry you guys. And then this...

305
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,956
...is for party time.

306
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:54,715
It happened.
I am telling you it happened.

307
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,759
Hey, it was great meeting you.

308
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:01,013
And, uh, Rachel? I don't think
I'll be calling you because, uh...

309
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,932
...you know, you've gotten weird.

310
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,853
Take care, you guys.

311
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,480
Wha... Wait a minute. Okay, look.

312
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:13,985
That night was the one wild thing
I've ever done in my life.

313
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,279
I won't let you take it away from me.

314
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,699
So if you don't remember that,
maybe you'll remember this...

315
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:31,377
Oh, my God. You love me.

316
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,298
- What?
- Of course I remember our kiss.

317
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,717
I think about it all the time.

318
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:41,429
I can still hear
the coconuts knocking together, I...

319
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:47,643
I didn't want to tell you, because I
didn't think you'd return my love.

320
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

321
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:55,151
Aw! Look who's being suddenly shy.

322
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,821
You have to feel what I feel.

323
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,699
Nobody can kiss that good
and not mean it.

324
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,077
I'm just a good kisser.

325
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,705
Shut up.

326
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,708
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,418
Oh.

328
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:17,340
Oh, you don't have to be sorry.

329
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,760
I'm obviously kidding.

330
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,971
I'm not in love with you.
I'm not in love with her.

331
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,642
I don't hear coconuts
banging together.

332
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:33,439
I don't picture your face
when I make love to my boyfriend.

333
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,734
Anyway, I gotta go.

334
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,153
A kiss goodbye?

335
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,947
No? Okay.

336
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,207
Wow!

337
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,711
I mean, I had no idea
that that would...

338
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,261
What the hell was that?

339
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,972
Just wanted to see
what all the fuss was about.

340
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,600
- And?
- I've had better.

341
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,776
I found one that fits.

342
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:23,864
Well, you know what they say?
23rd time's a charm.

343
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,869
Aw! Look at you, all handsome.

344
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,539
- Whose is it?
- Oh, does it matter?

345
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,126
All that matters
is that you look so handsome.

346
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,590
- Whose is it?
- I don't want to say.

347
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:45,052
Come on, I don't care. Whose is it?

348
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,971
Diane Keaton.
