1
00:00:03,557 --> 00:00:05,354
Are you looking at naked tribeswomen?

2
00:00:05,926 --> 00:00:07,257
No, look.

3
00:00:08,562 --> 00:00:10,120
That's a pig.

4
00:00:10,597 --> 00:00:13,259
l know.
But look at the knobs on it!

5
00:00:19,105 --> 00:00:21,096
Emily's cousin kicked me out.

6
00:00:21,374 --> 00:00:22,466
-What?
-Why?

7
00:00:22,709 --> 00:00:25,405
When you sublet
from your wife's cousin...

8
00:00:25,612 --> 00:00:29,742
...then you divorce, sometimes
the cousin wants his apartment back.

9
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,474
Didn't you sign a lease?

10
00:00:31,718 --> 00:00:34,118
Who needs a lease when it's ''family''?

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,481
You can stay with us.

12
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:40,248
Anything you need.

13
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,293
But you have to let us know
when you feel better...

14
00:00:43,563 --> 00:00:45,326
...so we can make fun of your hair.

15
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:49,165
You got it.

16
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:54,131
Thanks, l really appreciate this.
l'm going to get packing again.

17
00:00:54,407 --> 00:00:57,899
l've been moving around so much
that l feel like a nomad.

18
00:01:00,947 --> 00:01:04,178
-What?
-He thought you said gonad.

19
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,980
The One Where Ross Moves ln

20
00:01:54,134 --> 00:01:57,865
lf every place were this clean,
it'd be tough making a living.

21
00:01:58,572 --> 00:01:59,903
Oh, Larry!

22
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,065
Do health inspectors
work on commission?

23
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,675
No, bribes.

24
00:02:05,512 --> 00:02:07,980
-lt's okay to laugh?
-l was just kidding.

25
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,243
-l'll check the kitchen floor.
-Knock yourself out.

26
00:02:13,553 --> 00:02:16,681
l don't get violations.
You could eat beans off that floor.

27
00:02:16,856 --> 00:02:20,087
But don't, because that'd be a violation.

28
00:02:21,094 --> 00:02:22,652
Yummy!

29
00:02:25,065 --> 00:02:27,727
Yeah, l'd let him check out
my kitchen floor.

30
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:32,865
A ninety-eight.

31
00:02:33,673 --> 00:02:36,335
l deducted two points
for not wearing your hat.

32
00:02:36,543 --> 00:02:38,704
That is a Section 5 violation.

33
00:02:38,912 --> 00:02:41,073
Now look, Larry, honey.

34
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,948
l wrote the book on Section 5.

35
00:02:44,184 --> 00:02:46,675
You only need to wear it
in the kitchen.

36
00:02:46,886 --> 00:02:49,616
-Where's your hat?
-ln the kitchen. l'll get it.

37
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,388
There's the two points!

38
00:02:54,194 --> 00:02:56,924
You should really read
that book you wrote.

39
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:09,274
You saw the hat in the kitchen and
knew she'd go in hatless to get it.

40
00:03:09,476 --> 00:03:12,877
You could have your own
health inspector detective show.

41
00:03:14,214 --> 00:03:15,442
l don't know about that.

42
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:18,209
But then l could be
your sidekick, Voonda.

43
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:22,416
Maybe l could ask Voonda
to dinner sometime?

44
00:03:22,756 --> 00:03:24,451
She would love that...

45
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,253
...since you know
all the clean places to eat.

46
00:03:29,996 --> 00:03:31,759
l'll call you.

47
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,061
He's so funny!

48
00:03:45,812 --> 00:03:47,302
Thank you.

49
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:51,250
How's Ross doing
since all the Emily stuff?

50
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:52,849
He's not great.

51
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:56,145
But he's dealing with it.
Wait, you're not--

52
00:03:56,356 --> 00:03:59,757
l can't get started
with all that Ross stuff again.

53
00:03:59,993 --> 00:04:02,461
He'll be screwed up for a long time.

54
00:04:02,696 --> 00:04:06,427
Besides, l don't go for guys
right after they get divorced.

55
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,000
Right, you only go for them
five minutes before they get married.

56
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:17,006
-Two pounds of mocha java.
-lt's Danny.

57
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,638
Are you going to go out again?

58
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:22,679
l don't know.
He hasn't called since we went out.

59
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:25,976
l see him in the hallway.
We flirt. l'm all:

60
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,712
And then nothing.

61
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,686
Wow, thirsty.

62
00:04:32,892 --> 00:04:36,350
l'm having a party on Saturday.
Sort of a housewarming thing.

63
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:38,124
-Fun.
-Great!

64
00:04:38,331 --> 00:04:39,798
l'm looking forward to it.

65
00:04:40,066 --> 00:04:41,192
See you!

66
00:04:46,306 --> 00:04:48,900
So l guess we won't
be warming his house.

67
00:04:51,711 --> 00:04:54,202
All right, l see what he's doing.

68
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:58,474
He's not asking me out
because he wants me to ask him out.

69
00:04:58,885 --> 00:04:59,874
And you won't do that.

70
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:01,485
That's right!

71
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:04,815
Because that would give him
the control.

72
00:05:05,058 --> 00:05:08,186
So now he comes up with this
''l've got a party'' thing...

73
00:05:08,394 --> 00:05:11,022
...to get me to hint
for an invitation.

74
00:05:11,264 --> 00:05:13,164
Blew up in his face, didn't it?

75
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:16,432
So there is no party?

76
00:05:17,403 --> 00:05:20,338
No, there's a party.
There's a party.

77
00:05:20,573 --> 00:05:22,040
But the power?

78
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:24,403
That is still up for grabs.

79
00:05:24,844 --> 00:05:26,607
You follow me?

80
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,142
l think so.

81
00:05:28,348 --> 00:05:32,216
So he won't invite you to his party
because he likes you?

82
00:05:32,685 --> 00:05:33,674
Exactly!

83
00:05:36,523 --> 00:05:39,583
Then why didn't he invite me?

84
00:05:42,896 --> 00:05:44,693
To throw me off.

85
00:05:55,141 --> 00:05:56,768
Hey, roomies!

86
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:01,069
l love what you've done
with the place.

87
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:03,146
l know it's a lot of boxes.

88
00:06:03,383 --> 00:06:07,285
-l appreciate you letting me stay here.
-Not a problem.

89
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:09,614
Since you'll be here a while...

90
00:06:09,823 --> 00:06:12,792
...we could put your name
on the answering machine.

91
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:14,956
l hope you don't mind...

92
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:18,562
...but l kind of already
jazzed it up a little.

93
00:06:19,332 --> 00:06:20,629
Check it out.

94
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:27,331
<i>We will</i>

95
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:29,973
<i>We will call you back</i>

96
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:34,646
Pretty cool.

97
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,083
-You're fake laughing too, right?
-The tears are real.

98
00:06:44,657 --> 00:06:46,852
You look beautiful this evening.

99
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,159
Show me the badge again.

100
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:56,333
Shiny.

101
00:06:57,036 --> 00:07:01,029
You mind if l wash up?
Who knows where these have been?

102
00:07:01,307 --> 00:07:03,366
You are just nonstop!

103
00:07:14,287 --> 00:07:16,016
-We're out of here.
-Why?

104
00:07:16,222 --> 00:07:20,056
l saw 1 0 violations.
l'm shutting this place down!

105
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,625
-You have the power to do that?
-This does.

106
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:26,496
Shut it down.

107
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:42,305
What are you doing?

108
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:44,511
Nothing.

109
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:48,210
You built a fort, didn't you?

110
00:07:50,423 --> 00:07:51,822
Kind of.

111
00:07:52,058 --> 00:07:55,516
Oh, my God! The air purifier.
Ross' air purifier.

112
00:07:55,828 --> 00:07:59,093
All l heard for four years
through college was....

113
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:03,862
You should have gone out
once in a while.

114
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,561
-l hate this thing!
-Come on, Chandler.

115
00:08:06,873 --> 00:08:09,535
Ross is our friend.
He needs us right now.

116
00:08:09,742 --> 00:08:13,872
So why don't you be a grownup
and come watch TV in the fort?

117
00:08:18,384 --> 00:08:21,512
Can't believe that Larry closed down
Churman's. l love that place.

118
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:24,088
You should have heard
about all their violations.

119
00:08:24,257 --> 00:08:28,284
Larry said that they should call it Vermin's.

120
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:30,486
That guy just plain kills me.

121
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:40,135
l wanted to invite you to the party.

122
00:08:40,606 --> 00:08:42,665
Thanks, l'll try to stop by.

123
00:08:42,976 --> 00:08:45,968
Actually, l think
l'm going to be busy.

124
00:08:46,245 --> 00:08:47,234
You are?

125
00:08:49,315 --> 00:08:51,510
Remember, l've got that gala?

126
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,751
What's the gala for?

127
00:08:56,823 --> 00:08:59,087
lt's a regatta gala.

128
00:08:59,993 --> 00:09:01,085
Do you sail?

129
00:09:01,461 --> 00:09:03,759
No, but l support it.

130
00:09:05,598 --> 00:09:09,125
l hope l see you tomorrow night.
Take care.

131
00:09:12,939 --> 00:09:15,533
Walked right into that one,
didn't he?

132
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:17,105
What one?

133
00:09:17,343 --> 00:09:19,868
You wanted him to invite you
and he did.

134
00:09:20,213 --> 00:09:23,273
He waited until the last minute.
So if l said yes...

135
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:27,214
...he'd know l had nothing better
to do than wait for his invitation.

136
00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:28,818
But l said no...

137
00:09:29,022 --> 00:09:31,889
...which puts me back
in the driver's seat.

138
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,457
So the ball is in his court?

139
00:09:34,694 --> 00:09:35,786
Ball?

140
00:09:35,995 --> 00:09:37,860
No, there's no ball.

141
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:41,333
Hey, Pheebs, you want to join us?

142
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:45,130
-Oh, sure, yeah. Where is this from?
-lt's from Sun Ling's.

143
00:09:45,304 --> 00:09:50,105
Oh, Larry just told me
something about Sun Ling.

144
00:09:50,276 --> 00:09:52,574
Oh, no, thank you.

145
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:04,483
Joey, please.

146
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:05,917
Sorry.

147
00:10:23,109 --> 00:10:24,701
Hello, children.

148
00:10:25,478 --> 00:10:28,106
You want to play some foosball?
Please?

149
00:10:31,117 --> 00:10:34,951
We moved the table into my room
because of all the boxes.

150
00:10:35,188 --> 00:10:36,553
Come on!

151
00:10:42,495 --> 00:10:44,292
l have one question.

152
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:47,192
What is the deal with this?

153
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:51,293
Bye-bye, little puppet Joey hand?

154
00:10:52,038 --> 00:10:53,528
No, the quiet down thing.

155
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,173
You mean this.

156
00:10:59,378 --> 00:11:01,676
l don't know how much more
l can take.

157
00:11:01,914 --> 00:11:06,010
Did you know he taped over my <i>Baywatch</i>
tape with a show about bugs?

158
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:09,086
My God!

159
00:11:09,555 --> 00:11:11,853
What if that had been porn?

160
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:14,792
All right, this may be tough...

161
00:11:14,994 --> 00:11:17,554
...but it's Ross.
l survived college with him.

162
00:11:18,164 --> 00:11:21,031
l guess l can hold out
a little longer.

163
00:11:21,234 --> 00:11:22,861
Let's have a game.

164
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:30,764
Fellas?

165
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,107
So he's out of here.

166
00:11:47,627 --> 00:11:51,654
Got anything to eat?
l went to Jono's and it was closed.

167
00:11:51,898 --> 00:11:56,392
l took Larry there, but it was all
violated, so we shut it down.

168
00:11:57,303 --> 00:12:01,399
lf this guy keeps closing our
favorite places, where will we eat?

169
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:03,302
l don't know. Clean places?

170
00:12:03,543 --> 00:12:04,737
Yum!

171
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:11,805
lt's Danny.

172
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:15,076
Don't let him in!
l'm supposed to be at a gala.

173
00:12:15,321 --> 00:12:17,846
We'll be right there.
Can't you say it's later?

174
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:21,660
What kind of a regatta gala
starts at night?

175
00:12:22,228 --> 00:12:23,422
The fake kind.

176
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:31,267
-l need a ladle. You got a ladle?
-We have a ladle.

177
00:12:33,873 --> 00:12:35,864
See you at the party.

178
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:41,504
You know what Larry would say?
He'd say, ''See you ladle.''

179
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:49,443
l'm done. You want anything?
Sports? lnternational?

180
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:50,883
Apartment listings?

181
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:52,680
l'll take sports.

182
00:12:52,892 --> 00:12:54,223
Mine!

183
00:12:55,995 --> 00:12:57,519
All right, international.

184
00:12:57,797 --> 00:12:58,821
That's mine too.

185
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,392
l'm ltalian.

186
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:08,465
l could check apartment listings,
though there's never anything here.

187
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,903
Not even on page seven?

188
00:13:13,846 --> 00:13:16,610
You're right.
Here's an affordable place.

189
00:13:16,816 --> 00:13:21,150
Two-bedroom, close to work.
lt's available in five weeks.

190
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:23,322
What about that circled one?

191
00:13:24,724 --> 00:13:27,989
lt's kind of expensive for a studio.

192
00:13:28,227 --> 00:13:29,922
But it's available now.

193
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:31,220
lsn't it?

194
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,920
Yes, it is.

195
00:13:33,232 --> 00:13:35,166
Let's go look at it!

196
00:13:37,003 --> 00:13:38,493
There we go!

197
00:13:40,673 --> 00:13:45,770
Guys, would you chip in for some
new air filters for the purifier?

198
00:13:46,178 --> 00:13:49,113
l mean, after all,
we are all using it.

199
00:13:49,382 --> 00:13:50,371
Let's go quicker!

200
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,961
Oh, my God!

201
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:09,757
Look at this kitchen/bathroom.

202
00:14:10,736 --> 00:14:14,137
That's great!
So you can cook while in the tub.

203
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:16,136
Somebody was using his head.

204
00:14:17,977 --> 00:14:20,571
Let's check out
the rest of the place.

205
00:14:29,555 --> 00:14:31,614
l think this is it.

206
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:35,590
l don't know.
Maybe we should keep looking.

207
00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:38,295
But this place is available now.

208
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:41,623
You don't want to be stuck
with us for five weeks.

209
00:14:47,907 --> 00:14:50,671
So you think l should
take this place?

210
00:14:50,943 --> 00:14:52,570
lt's perfect!

211
00:14:56,582 --> 00:14:58,140
How about you?

212
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:00,817
Kitchen, slash, bathroom.

213
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:06,583
l see what you guys are saying.

214
00:15:06,826 --> 00:15:09,659
l'll go downstairs
and fill out an application.

215
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,259
We are bad people.

216
00:15:17,136 --> 00:15:19,832
He knew we were trying
to get rid of him.

217
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:25,637
Could we get a bathtub
in our kitchen?

218
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:31,346
Ready for dinner?

219
00:15:31,617 --> 00:15:33,551
-Absolutely.
-Great.

220
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:35,980
You wanted to go to
the ltalian place on Bleecker St.?

221
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:37,951
l love that place!

222
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,657
So, no.

223
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,355
How about Mama Lozetti's?

224
00:15:43,863 --> 00:15:45,023
Sure.

225
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:49,032
How long has that milk
been sitting out?

226
00:15:49,568 --> 00:15:51,866
No, this place is totally healthy.

227
00:15:52,138 --> 00:15:54,629
This milk is mine.
l bought this today...

228
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,741
...because l was thirsty for milk,
you know?

229
00:16:02,014 --> 00:16:03,641
Okay, let's go.

230
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:07,981
Hey, buddy.

231
00:16:08,254 --> 00:16:13,317
Health Code 1 1 B requires that refuse
be taken out the back exit.

232
00:16:13,526 --> 00:16:15,824
But then l have to go
all the way around.

233
00:16:16,061 --> 00:16:18,996
So you choose convenience
over health?

234
00:16:19,732 --> 00:16:24,260
Would you be interested in a free coffee?

235
00:16:24,437 --> 00:16:26,064
Stop, Larry.

236
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,434
Can't you just be Larry and not
Larry the health inspector guy?

237
00:16:32,745 --> 00:16:34,576
lt was exciting at first.

238
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:39,216
But now, it's like, so where
are we going to eat ever?

239
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:43,120
l suppose l could give him a warning.

240
00:16:43,355 --> 00:16:44,617
Thank you.

241
00:16:45,624 --> 00:16:46,613
Go, go!

242
00:16:50,963 --> 00:16:54,455
lf, after dinner,
you still need to bust someone...

243
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,965
...l know a hot dog vendor
who picks his nose.

244
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:05,638
Maybe we did good,
helping Ross get back on his feet.

245
00:17:05,945 --> 00:17:07,572
That was a nice place.

246
00:17:07,813 --> 00:17:12,807
No closet space, but he could hang
his stuff out the window in a bag.

247
00:17:17,223 --> 00:17:18,212
What do we do?

248
00:17:18,724 --> 00:17:20,248
l don't know.

249
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:22,120
Maybe pizza?

250
00:17:23,496 --> 00:17:25,293
About Ross!

251
00:17:34,573 --> 00:17:38,270
lt's the apartment manager.
Ross put us as references.

252
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:41,674
Ross is the greatest guy.
He's very reliable--

253
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:46,316
Of course, he has a big, huge dog
that barks into the night.

254
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,585
Well, who doesn't love dogs?

255
00:17:51,457 --> 00:17:53,448
He's a tap dancer.

256
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,622
Yes, some would say
that is a lost art.

257
00:17:58,497 --> 00:18:00,522
He's a pimp!

258
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:03,692
There you go. He's a pimp.

259
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:05,994
He's a big, tap-dancing pimp!

260
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:28,923
-Okay, honey, l'm ready.
-What are you doing?

261
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:32,621
l am going to wander into the party
and l will be all, you know:

262
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:36,427
''l don't need this,
l'm coming from a regatta gala.''

263
00:18:39,071 --> 00:18:41,437
Did you get this out of a book?

264
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:45,873
Monica, honey, this is as real as it gets.

265
00:18:56,488 --> 00:18:59,252
This is never going to work.
He's right there.

266
00:18:59,491 --> 00:19:00,549
Just go say hi.

267
00:19:00,826 --> 00:19:05,786
l have to go downstairs and back up,
as if l'm coming home from the gala.

268
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:10,126
So just go distract him.
But don't be sexy.

269
00:19:13,172 --> 00:19:14,264
What's going on?

270
00:19:14,473 --> 00:19:17,442
This is a great party.
Great food.

271
00:19:19,144 --> 00:19:24,104
You know, most parties, it's all
chips and salsa, chips and salsa.

272
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,811
So....

273
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:28,976
What's this?

274
00:19:29,822 --> 00:19:30,811
Salad.

275
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,987
And what's this?

276
00:19:36,295 --> 00:19:37,626
Bread.

277
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,792
Aren't you a chef?

278
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,695
Right, tonight was your party.

279
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,033
You look great!
l'm glad you made it.

280
00:19:50,342 --> 00:19:53,709
Well, you know,
the gala had to end sometime.

281
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:57,440
Don't go anywhere.
l'll be right back.

282
00:19:59,752 --> 00:20:02,220
Whose court is the ball in now?

283
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:05,585
l thought there wasn't a ball.

284
00:20:06,425 --> 00:20:10,828
Come on. He's glad l came.
He doesn't want me to go anywhere.

285
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,724
Ball's flying all over the place.

286
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,165
This is my friend, Tom.

287
00:20:16,435 --> 00:20:19,063
This is the girl l told you about.

288
00:20:19,271 --> 00:20:22,263
Come on!
You telling people about me?

289
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:25,405
l think you two
could really hit it off.

290
00:20:25,978 --> 00:20:27,741
l'm gonna go mingle.

291
00:20:29,348 --> 00:20:33,751
So you work at Bloomingdale's?
My mom calls it ''Bloomies.''

292
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:42,584
At ease, soldier!

293
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:45,318
l'm sorry?

294
00:20:45,531 --> 00:20:48,967
You can just drop the act.
l know what's going on.

295
00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:51,159
You're Danny's wingman, right?

296
00:20:51,437 --> 00:20:54,804
You guys are best buds, frat bros.

297
00:20:56,341 --> 00:20:59,003
l'm going to go talk to a friend.

298
00:20:59,311 --> 00:21:02,109
Yeah, you go talk to your friend.

299
00:21:02,347 --> 00:21:04,338
Go tell him, ''Nice try.''

300
00:21:08,353 --> 00:21:10,446
He just keeps lobbing them up...

301
00:21:10,656 --> 00:21:14,023
...and l keep knocking them
right out of the park.

302
00:21:16,328 --> 00:21:18,353
l think l need a drink.

303
00:21:22,968 --> 00:21:24,629
Ninety-eight...

304
00:21:24,837 --> 00:21:26,304
...ninety-nine...

305
00:21:26,538 --> 00:21:28,403
...one hundred!

306
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,800
Okay. Go.

307
00:21:30,042 --> 00:21:32,135
Dude, l'm telling you, l'm fine.

308
00:21:36,081 --> 00:21:37,878
Here we go, here we go.

309
00:21:41,086 --> 00:21:45,716
So l didn't get that apartment.
Some problem with my application.

310
00:21:45,924 --> 00:21:47,186
You're kidding?

311
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:51,556
But Phoebe said l could stay
at her place for a while, so....

312
00:21:51,764 --> 00:21:55,165
Well, you can't stay with Phoebe.
We're roomies.

313
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,233
You don't need me
taking up all your space.

314
00:21:58,504 --> 00:22:02,907
We got plenty of space.
There's still some by that speaker.

315
00:22:05,277 --> 00:22:06,938
Please, just stay.

316
00:22:07,346 --> 00:22:08,404
Are you sure?

317
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,740
-Definitely.
-You have to stay.

318
00:22:17,422 --> 00:22:19,253
So l'm a pimp, huh?

319
00:22:21,927 --> 00:22:23,758
lt's okay.

320
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:26,293
Sometimes l can be a pain in the ass.

321
00:22:26,532 --> 00:22:30,127
But just talk to me.
Tell me if something bothers you.

322
00:22:30,402 --> 00:22:35,533
And l'll do everything l can
to keep my annoying habits just....

323
00:22:51,623 --> 00:22:54,490
Well, l see you've had
a very productive day.

324
00:22:55,194 --> 00:22:57,128
The cowboy hat's a little much.

325
00:22:57,396 --> 00:22:59,296
Come on, it's fun!

326
00:23:02,401 --> 00:23:03,390
All right.

327
00:23:11,043 --> 00:23:12,510
lsn't this a woman's hat?

328
00:23:13,512 --> 00:23:15,412
Stop talking crazy, and make us tea!

329
00:23:16,548 --> 00:23:17,537
