1
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,634
Come in.

2
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,846
I've been waiting for you.

3
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:17,516
Hi, I just...

4
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,644
Ah! Oh, my God! Monica!

5
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,438
Oh, my God!

6
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,523
I'm sorry! I was...

7
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,983
I was taking a nap.

8
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,445
Since when do you
take naps in that position?

9
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:34,533
Tell me you were waiting for a guy.
Please tell me.

10
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,828
Yes, I was. A guy.

11
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,747
From work.

12
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,750
I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!

13
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,754
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant.

14
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,048
The one that looks like
a non-threatening Ray Liotta?

15
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,009
Aha. That one!

16
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:55,929
Give me a second. I'll be out of your hair.
I'm just going to grab a jacket.

17
00:00:56,097 --> 00:01:00,059
When I get back,
I want every little detail.

18
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,354
Maybe that's him.

19
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:07,357
Okay, um... Okay, um...

20
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,236
It's just Joey and Ross.

21
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,821
Why aren't you at the movie?

22
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:16,408
We were, but Ross was talking
so loud on his phone, they threw us out.

23
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:20,037
I had to talk loud
because the movie was loud!

24
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,793
- He's talking to London.
- Did he get in touch with Emily?

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,087
No. He's calling everyone
on her side of the family...

26
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,422
...hoping someone
will help him get in touch with her.

27
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:36,220
I don't care if I said some
other girl's name, you prissy old twit!

28
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,805
Ross.

29
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,307
Way to suck up to the family!

30
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:52,903
I'm so glad you're all here. My office
finally got wrinkle-free fax paper!

31
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:47,624
- Hey
- Oh, no, no! Vomit tux! No, no! Vomit tux!

32
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,877
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.

33
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,086
Vomit tux?

34
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,463
Who vomited on...

35
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,842
You know what? What you up to, Joe?

36
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,720
They're doing
this telethon thing on TV.

37
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,472
And my agent got me a job as co-host!

38
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,183
That's great!

39
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,270
A little good deed for PBS,
plus some TV exposure.

40
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,732
That's the kind of math
Joey likes to do.

41
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,027
Oh, PBS!

42
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,030
- What's wrong with PBS?
- What's right with them?

43
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,325
Why don't you like PBS?

44
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:26,914
Right after my Mom killed herself,
I was in this bad place, you know, personally.

45
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:31,710
So I just thought it would make me
feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street.

46
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,796
Because they were so nice
when I was a little kid.

47
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,924
No one ever wrote back.

48
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:40,260
A lot of those Muppets
don't have thumbs.

49
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:46,058
All I got was a lousy keychain, and
by that time, I was living in a box.

50
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,101
I didn't have keys!

51
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,520
I'm sorry, Pheebs.

52
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:54,024
I just wanted to do a good deed,
like you did with the babies.

53
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:58,528
This isn't a good deed. You just want
to get on TV. This is totally selfish.

54
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,155
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

55
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,824
What about you having
those babies for your brother?

56
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,576
Talk about selfish!

57
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,288
What are you talking about?

58
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,708
It was a nice thing,
but it made you feel good, right?

59
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,126
Yeah, so?

60
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:16,046
It made you feel good
so that makes it selfish.

61
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,758
Look, there's no
unselfish good deeds. Sorry.

62
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,679
Yes, there are totally
good deeds that are selfless!

63
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,764
May I ask for one example?

64
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,642
Yeah, it's... You know, there's...

65
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,769
No, you may not!

66
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,606
That's because all people are selfish.

67
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,817
Are you calling me selfish?

68
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,695
Are you calling you people?

69
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:45,784
Sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs,
but selfless good deeds don't exist.

70
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:46,994
Okay?

71
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,996
And you know the deal on Santa Claus,
right?

72
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:54,918
I'm gonna find a selfless good deed.
I'm going to beat you, you evil genius!

73
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,007
- Hello?
- Hello, Ross?

74
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,383
Emily?

75
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,927
Oh, my God! It's Emily!

76
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,179
It's Emily, everyone! Shh! Shh! Shh!

77
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,474
Hi.

78
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,353
I'm only ringing to say
stop harassing my relatives. Goodbye.

79
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:18,734
Wait! Okay, okay, you can hang up,
but I'll keep calling everyone in England...

80
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,403
...if that's what it takes
to get you to talk to me.

81
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,280
Really? About what?

82
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,866
Look, you're my wife. We're married.

83
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,118
You know, I love you.

84
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,662
I really miss you.

85
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,498
I miss you too.

86
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,876
Well, at least I think I do.

87
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,711
She's talking.

88
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,428
When you said "the deal with Santa Claus,"
you meant?

89
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,055
That he doesn't exist.

90
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,806
Right.

91
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,731
Chandler, have you heard
about Monica's secret boyfriend?

92
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,902
Yeah, she might have mentioned him.

93
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:06,907
So, Mon, when are we going
to meet this new, secret waiter man?

94
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,327
He's really shy. I don't think
he's up to meeting everyone yet.

95
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,913
Yeah, I don't think he's up
to meeting everyone yet.

96
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:17,501
I don't care, I wanna meet this guy
who's the best sex she ever had.

97
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,420
Really?

98
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,424
That's what you heard? You said that?

99
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,093
I might have said that.

100
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,764
Why is that funny?

101
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,434
Because I'm very happy for him.

102
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,229
And you! You lucky dog!

103
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,149
- Hi.
- Hey.

104
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,735
Well, Emily's willing to work
on the relationship.

105
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,153
- That's great!
- Yes!

106
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,405
In London.

107
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,449
- What?
- She wants me to move to London.

108
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,700
But you live here.

109
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,747
You know that.

110
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,583
What are you gonna do?

111
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,670
I bet if I talked to Carol and Susan...

112
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,757
...I could convince them
to move to London with Ben.

113
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,927
I'm sure your ex-wife would be more
than happy to move to another country...

114
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,763
...so you can patch things up
with your new wife.

115
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,976
It could happen.

116
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,817
How you doing? Welcome.
Good to see you.

117
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,403
This'll be your phone.

118
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,700
That's great.

119
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,870
But I'm not really
expecting a lot of calls.

120
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,539
No, you answer it and take pledges.

121
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,040
But I'm the host.

122
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:43,086
No, Gary Collins is the host.
You'll be answering the phone.

123
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,425
You don't seem to understand.
See, I was Dr. Drake Ramoray.

124
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,136
Well, here's your phone, doctor.

125
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,641
I can't believe I can't find
a selfless good deed.

126
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,311
You know that really old guy
that lives next door to me?

127
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,814
I snuck over there and raked up
all the leaves on his front stoop.

128
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:07,235
But he caught me, and he
force-fed me cider and cookies.

129
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,657
Then I felt wonderful.
That old jackass!

130
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,536
Maybe Joey's right.
Maybe all good deeds are selfish.

131
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:20,165
I will find a selfless good deed.
Because I just gave birth to three children...

132
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,252
...and I will not let them be raised
in a world where Joey's right!

133
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,089
Hey, Monica?
Can I ask you a cooking question?

134
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,551
- Sure.
- If you're cooking on the stove...

135
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:35,639
...does that mean that your new secret
boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?

136
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,850
Chandler.

137
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,228
Is he?

138
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,359
I think I'm going to respect the privacy
of my new, secret boyfriend.

139
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,778
Why?

140
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,781
If this guy was me...

141
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:57,244
...and it's me who'd learned that it was
me who was the best you'd ever had...

142
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,787
...I'd be going like this:

143
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,090
All right, Emily.

144
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,133
As much as I love you...

145
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,845
...I'm sorry, I can't
move to London without Ben.

146
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,932
I understand that would be difficult.

147
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,894
Would you consider moving here?
You were moving here anyway.

148
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,272
Why can't you just do that?

149
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,524
I don't know. It's just...

150
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:34,531
Okay, okay, but I know that even though
I've been a complete idiot up till now...

151
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,533
...you have to come here.

152
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:40,287
You have to, so we can
work this out together.

153
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,247
All right.

154
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,958
All right? Did you just say "all right"?

155
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,711
I did. Now I'm the idiot.

156
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,046
Emily, that is so great!

157
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,423
It'll be great!

158
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,594
We're going to be
like two idiots in love!

159
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:02,100
Ross, there's one thing that
really scares me still.

160
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,769
- Yes, tell me.
- You have to understand...

161
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,230
...how humiliating it was
for me up on that altar...

162
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,275
...in front of my entire family,
all my friends.

163
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,445
I know. I am so sorry.

164
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,449
And then, after deciding
to forgive you...

165
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,036
...seeing you at the airport,
catching our plane with her.

166
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,706
Again, very sorry.

167
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,002
I mean, I can't be
in the same room as her.

168
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,881
It drives me mad thinking of you
being in the same room as her.

169
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,344
Emily, there is nothing
between Rachel and me.

170
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:38,887
Okay?

171
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,014
I love you.

172
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,850
All right.

173
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,896
I'll come to New York
and we'll try to make this work.

174
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,481
That is so great!

175
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,318
As long as you
don't see Rachel anymore.

176
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:04,037
I asked Emily
if she would come to New York.

177
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,830
And she said yes.

178
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,750
- Great!
- No, no, no.

179
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,629
Only if I promise
never to see Rachel again.

180
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,297
What? You can't...

181
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,548
What did you tell her?

182
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,592
I told her I'd have to think about it.

183
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,970
I mean, how the hell am I supposed to
make this kind of a decision?

184
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,641
I'm actually asking you!

185
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,019
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore.

186
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,146
She's one of your best friends.

187
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,982
But he can't not see Emily,
I mean that's his wife!

188
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,401
- That's true!
- Yeah, right?

189
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:39,447
But you've known Rachel since high school
and you cannot just cut her out of your life.

190
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,491
- That's true!
- No, you cannot.

191
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,578
Thanks for the help. Problem solved!

192
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,043
- Hello?
- Hey, Mon.

193
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,463
Oh, hey, Joey. We've been watching all day.
When are you gonna be on TV?

194
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,217
There was kind of a mix-up
in my agent's office...

195
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,886
...but I'm still on TV,
and that's good exposure.

196
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,389
You're not on TV.

197
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,936
Oh, okay. How about now?

198
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,023
Yeah! There he is! There he is!

199
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,484
Hello, New York!

200
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,406
Maybe just put the whole duck
right in there. Who cares?

201
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,409
- Now I got the legs.
- Aw! Aw!

202
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:32,167
How many times have I told you guys
to never watch the cooking channel?

203
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,711
- Hi, Chandler.
- Hey.

204
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,714
Listen, I need that broiling pan
that Joey borrowed the other day.

205
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,215
That was yours?

206
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:43,887
We used it when the duck
was throwing up caterpillars.

207
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,432
Williams-Sonoma,
fall catalog, page 27.

208
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,225
Expect it in 4 to 6 weeks.

209
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:55,398
Hey. Joey's gonna be at the telethon
for the rest of the day.

210
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,609
We have the whole place to ourselves.

211
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,277
Yeah, so?

212
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:04,574
Just thought maybe you'd want to book
some time with "the best you've ever had."

213
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,494
You know what, champ?

214
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,037
I think I'll pass.

215
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,040
- Why?
- Why?

216
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,679
What's your point?

217
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,894
PBS Telethon.

218
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,687
Hey, Joey.

219
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,982
I just wanted to let you know
that I found a selfless good deed.

220
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,402
I went down to the park
and I let a bee sting me.

221
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,447
What good is that going to do anybody?

222
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:48,451
It helps the bee look tough
in front of his bee friends.

223
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,704
The bee is happy,
and I am definitely not.

224
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:55,542
You know, the bee probably
died after he stung you.

225
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,340
Damn it!

226
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,052
Back on in 30 seconds, people!

227
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,187
Excuse me,
would you mind switching with me?

228
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,648
No way. I'm in the shot, man.

229
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,443
- You've been here all day!
- I'm taking pledges.

230
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,405
And we're on three, two...

231
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,949
Welcome back to our fall telethon.

232
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,910
If you've been enjoying
the performance of Cirque du Soleil...

233
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:35,123
...and you'd like to see more of the same
kind of programming, it's very simple.

234
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,418
All you have to do is call in and pledge...

235
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:44,215
...and at that time tell one of our volunteers
what type of programming you...

236
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,552
Okay.

237
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,848
That's it. I cannot make this decision.
It is too difficult.

238
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,226
So I'm just going leave it entirely
up to the gods of fate.

239
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,355
A Magic 8 Ball?

240
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,233
You can't make this decision
with a toy!

241
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,444
It's not a toy.

242
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,406
I don't know what else to do!

243
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,869
I either keep my wife
and lose one of my best friends...

244
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,873
...or I keep my friend and get divorced
for the second time before I'm 30.

245
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,376
So if anyone else has
a better suggestion, let's hear it.

246
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,004
Because I got nothing! Don't be shy.

247
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,590
Any suggestion will do.

248
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,889
Okay, then.

249
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,685
Here we go.

250
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,355
Magic 8 Ball...

251
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,399
...should I never see Rachel again?

252
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,363
"Ask Again Later."

253
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,660
Later is not good enough!

254
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,500
"Ask Again Later."

255
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,709
What the hell?

256
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:05,171
This is broken! It is broken!

257
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,548
Let me see.

258
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,969
Will Chandler have sex tonight?

259
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,929
"Don't Count On it."

260
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,644
Seems like it works to me.

261
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,940
PBS Telethon.

262
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,149
Hi, Joey.

263
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,442
Hey, Pheebs.

264
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,152
I'd like to make a pledge.

265
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,405
I would like to donate $200.

266
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,864
Two hundred dollars?

267
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,867
You sure?
After what Sesame Street did to you?

268
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:38,579
I'm still mad at them, but I also know
that they bring happiness...

269
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,249
...to lots of kids
whose moms didn't kill themselves.

270
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,834
You know, so...

271
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:47,880
...by supporting them, I'm doing a good
thing, but I'm not happy about it.

272
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,842
So there! A selfless good deed.

273
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,761
And you don't feel a little good
about donating the money?

274
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,515
No, it sucks.
I was saving up to buy a hamster.

275
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,727
A hamster?
Those things are, like, 10 bucks.

276
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,396
Not the one I had my eye on.

277
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:07,650
It looks like we have surpassed
last year's pledge total.

278
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,901
Thank you!

279
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:14,282
And the pledge that did it
was taken by one of our volunteers.

280
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:20,663
Oh, boy! And may I say,
one of our sharpest dressed volunteers.

281
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,999
Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!

282
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,417
Oh, look!

283
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,252
Joey's on TV!

284
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,754
Isn't that great?

285
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:31,507
My pledge got Joey on TV!
That makes me feel so...

286
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,426
Oh, no!

287
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,225
Look...

288
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:45,730
...maybe I got carried away before,
but there's something you gotta know.

289
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:50,443
If I'm the best, it's only
because you made me the best.

290
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,363
Keep talking.

291
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,616
I was nothing before you.

292
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,285
Call the other girls and ask.

293
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,205
Which wouldn't take long.

294
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:06,167
But when I'm with you,
and we're together...

295
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,837
...oh, my God!

296
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,637
- Really?
- Oh, my God!

297
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,185
Now, I understand if you never
want to sleep with me again.

298
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,437
But that would be wrong.

299
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,981
We're too good.

300
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:32,693
We owe it to sex!

301
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,322
Well, if we owe it!

302
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,992
Oh, my!

303
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,037
When is Joey gonna be home?

304
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,374
I was kind of hoping
we could do this without him.

305
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:51,087
No, no, no! Leave the gloves on.

306
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,964
But I just cleaned the bathroom.

307
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,675
- Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves?
- Yeah.

308
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,930
All right.
Let's show them how it's done.

309
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,974
Okay. Ow!

310
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,603
- That wasn't part of it.
- I know.

311
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,745
Hi. You ready? We're going to be late.

312
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,082
- For what?
- For Stella, remember?

313
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,169
She's getting her groove back
in 20 minutes.

314
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,756
Yeah, I totally forgot about that.

315
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:39,844
Mind if I take a rain check?
I'm waiting for a call from Emily.

316
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,680
Sure, I guess.

317
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,559
Hey, I hear you don't have to go
to London. Yay.

318
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:52,523
It's not that easy. There's still
a lot of relationship stuff.

319
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,108
Like what?

320
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,776
Just stuff.

321
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:59,947
You know, kind of what Emily wants.

322
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,533
Why don't you talk to me about it?
Maybe I can help.

323
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:07,330
No, no, you can't help.

324
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:12,501
I mean, I kind of have to do this
without your help.

325
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,795
Well, I...

326
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:19,884
I know you can do that too. I'm just saying
if you need somebody to talk to...

327
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,261
Hi.

328
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,181
Thanks.

329
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:32,188
Ross, look, whatever this
relationship stuff is that Emily wants...

330
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,315
...just give it to her.

331
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,026
The bottom line is that you love her.

332
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,403
So just fix whatever she wants fixed.

333
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,530
Just do it.

334
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:47,495
You're going to have to try.
You'll just hate yourself if you don't.

335
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,292
Come on, answer it!
It's driving me crazy.

336
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,045
Hello?

337
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,339
Hi, sweetie.

338
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,466
Good.

339
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,845
Look. Yes, I've been thinking...

340
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:08,933
...about that thing
you wanted me to do...

341
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,937
...and I can do it.

342
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,025
So will you come to New York?

343
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,653
