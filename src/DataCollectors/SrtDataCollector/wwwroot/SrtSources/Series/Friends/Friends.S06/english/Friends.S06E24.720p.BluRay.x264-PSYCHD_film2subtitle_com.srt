1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:06,714
That is the most beautiful
engagement ring ever!

2
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:10,009
You should know,
you bought like a billion of them.

3
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,886
You didn't get one.

4
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:17,933
- Tonight's the big night.
- How will you ask her?

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:21,103
It'll be perfect.
We'll go to her favorite restaurant.

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:26,442
I'll get her a bottle of the champagne she really
loves, therefore knows how expensive it is.

7
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:33,240
Then, when the glasses are full, instead
of proposing a toast, I'll propose.

8
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,909
- Aw.
- Sounds perfect!

9
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,038
You'll mess up. Let me do it.

10
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,789
I won't mess up.

11
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,167
If she says no,
can I have the ring?

12
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,712
- She won't say no.
- If?

13
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,675
- Hey.
- Hey.

14
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,469
Hey, Monica.

15
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,307
- Give it.
- It's gone.

16
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,435
Phoebe.

17
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,732
- Hey.
- Hey, Monica!

18
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,778
We're practically kissing.

19
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,735
- Hey.
- Hey.

20
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:56,782
Anyone free tonight? My boss is
hosting a charity event for kids.

21
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,368
And the more people I bring,
the better I look.

22
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,078
So Monica, Chandler?

23
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,331
We can't go.
We're going to dinner. Remember?

24
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:08,168
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- What's the big deal?

25
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:13,048
I just get mad when Rachel doesn't
remember where we're going.

26
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,884
Where are you going?

27
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,264
- How about you guys?
- Open bar?

28
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,851
- I think so.
- I can do that for the kids.

29
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:29,356
I'll come. I'm making money now.
It's time I give some back.

30
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,109
You could give back
the money you owe me.

31
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,404
Okay. Have a benefit.

32
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,368
Ross, can you come
to a charity event tonight?

33
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,495
Oh. No, I have plans with Elizabeth.

34
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,373
Oh. You're already doing
your part for the kids.

35
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:53,172
It's our last night together before she
leaves for camp. To be a counselor.

36
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:59,553
I have a question. All jokes aside.
Where is this relationship going?

37
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,848
Wait a minute. All jokes aside?
I didn't agree to that.

38
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,853
- Do you see this as long-term thing?
- I don't know.

39
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,897
You are 12 years older than her.

40
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,399
Wait a minute.
Does everyone feel this way?

41
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,027
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sort of.

42
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:19,907
Uh, wow. Uh, I thought
you were making jokes. I had no idea.

43
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:24,369
You guys are wrong. Yes, there is
a chronological age difference.

44
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:28,498
But I never notice it,
because she is very mature.

45
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:33,462
It doesn't matter what you guys think.
I'm dating Elizabeth, not you.

46
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,089
Not what she said last night.

47
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,968
See, now he could date her.

48
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:49,102
Will you marry me?

49
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,230
Hey, you marry me.

50
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,573
What's going on, little elves?

51
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,951
It's the big night.
We wanted to wish you luck.

52
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,286
- Yeah. Have the ring?
- In my pocket.

53
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,913
Oh.

54
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,085
- Pheebs.
- Oh. Ha, ha.

55
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:19,508
Will you guys get out of here? I want this
to be a surprise, and she's gonna know.

56
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,302
Yeah, guys. Get out of here.

57
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,306
Hey. Hi, guys.

58
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:32,020
- You look beautiful.
- Aww. Thank you.

59
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,403
What's going on?

60
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,405
We're just really...

61
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,616
...excited about this charity event
that we have to go to.

62
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,082
- Here.
- Thank you.

63
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,459
So what's going on here?

64
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,670
Well, uh, this is a silent auction.

65
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:00,257
They lay the stuff here.
You write down your offer.

66
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,050
The highest bid gets it.

67
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:06,638
No. I know what a silent auction is.
What's going on with your hair?

68
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,643
- Uh, why?
- No, it's nice.

69
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,106
Nice to see you.
So glad you brought someone.

70
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,150
Someone? I brought people.

71
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,944
This is Phoebe.
Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson.

72
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,238
- He's the head of my department.
- Oh, hi.

73
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:27,159
- And I also brought my friend Joey.
- Ohh! Shrimp toast!

74
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,538
You know, I don't know where he is.

75
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,915
I hope you're gonna bid.

76
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,669
Actually, I was about to bid
on this lovely trip to Paris.

77
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,254
- Nice choice.
- Yeah.

78
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,381
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

79
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,716
Ha.

80
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:46,595
Okay, $20.00.

81
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,022
Shut the door! Shut the door!

82
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,523
What's going on?

83
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,026
Guys across the hall
are throwing water balloons.

84
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:05,030
Call the police. That's what I did
to kids in my building.

85
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,949
No, it's a water balloon fight.
We started it.

86
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,243
Oh. Hmm.

87
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:14,623
Um, I just stopped by to see
if you wanted to see this play tonight.

88
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,000
Um, it's excellent. The director is...

89
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,087
- Who drank all the kamikazes?
- Nobody. We put them in here!

90
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,258
- You want some?
- No, I... Okay, okay.

91
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:30,013
- Could I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, sure.

92
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,140
Um, so this play, um,
what do you think?

93
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,394
- It's gotten great reviews.
- Attack!

94
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:41,108
- Put your balloons down!
- You put your balloons down!

95
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:45,862
Everybody put their balloons down!

96
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,283
Now, this is a nice suit!

97
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,124
Our next item is
the romantic trip to Paris.

98
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:02,129
It goes to Emil Alexander
with a high bid of $2300.

99
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,423
Oh! So close!

100
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,343
Hey, you guys, look.
Got me some drinks.

101
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:13,056
- What are you doing?
- Open bar.

102
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,309
Finally, our biggest item
of the night.

103
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:19,980
The 22-foot
Gentleman's Daysailer sailboat.

104
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:24,985
The winning bid
was a whopping $20,000.

105
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,570
I won!

106
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,115
That was my guess!

107
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,325
What? What? What?

108
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,453
I guessed $20,000.

109
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:39,916
Joey, it is an auction.
You don't guess. You buy!

110
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,376
What?

111
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,005
I don't have $20,000.

112
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,008
Congratulations on your new boat,
Joey Tribbiani.

113
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,930
Joey, sit down.

114
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,726
Forget her. You enjoy this. Whoo!

115
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,328
What are you doing?

116
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,497
"One nation...

117
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:24,336
...under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all."

118
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,672
Ha, ha. I remembered it.
The champagne is here.

119
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,008
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Yes.

120
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,676
I'm good. Are you good?

121
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,887
Are you perfect?

122
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,722
Yeah. I'm okay.

123
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,891
I'm a little cold.
Can I have your jacket?

124
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,476
Oh. Yeah.

125
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,479
Uh, no, you can't have my jacket.

126
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,607
Because then I would be cold.

127
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,986
If you thought you'd be cold,
you should have brought a jacket.

128
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,406
Uh, other than that, are you okay?

129
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,202
Are you sure you're okay?

130
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,996
Yes. I'm fine.

131
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:05,335
In fact, I've been fine
for a long time now and I think...

132
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,128
...the reason is you.

133
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,631
That's sweet.

134
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,883
Okay. Um.

135
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:18,306
Before I met you,
I had really little life.

136
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:21,059
And I couldn't imagine growing old...

137
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,435
Oh, my God.

138
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,230
- I know. But let me say it.
- Oh, my God. Richard.

139
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,732
What? I'm Chandler.

140
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,611
Oh, that's Richard.

141
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,782
Maybe he won't see us.
Richard!

142
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,373
- Monica. Chandler.
- Hey.

143
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,501
I don't know why I did that.

144
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,381
- It's good to see you.
- You too. You let your hair grow.

145
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,175
Yeah. Oh, that's right,
you always wanted me to.

146
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,136
I see your mustache is back.

147
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,680
Well, my nose got lonely.

148
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,850
And you don't have a mustache,
which is good. Ha, ha.

149
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:07,022
I'm Chandler.
I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.

150
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:12,694
I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler.
We used to date.

151
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,614
Richard!
No one's supposed to know about us!

152
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,327
See, I did it again.

153
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,080
- Chandler, sit down.
- I'll sit down.

154
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,290
Good to see you.

155
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,042
Your table is ready, sir.

156
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,085
- Oh. Good to see you guys.
- Yes.

157
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,296
If you prefer, this table's available.

158
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,549
That might be fun.

159
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,930
What were you thinking?

160
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,016
I didn't know it was an auction.

161
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,643
I figured I'd take a guess.

162
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,188
Help a charity. Free boat!

163
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,024
Why would a charity
give away a free boat?

164
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,985
- I don't know. Charity?
- Oh!

165
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,530
Well, just buy the damn boat.

166
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,368
Phoebe, don't you think
you've had enough to drink?

167
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,662
I'm just helping the kids.

168
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,666
How is you drinking helping the kids?

169
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,836
Because the more I drink, the less
there is for the kids to drink.

170
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,177
Mr. Tribbiani.
Your contribution brings us...

171
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,846
...a big step closer
to building the youth center.

172
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:25,100
Just out of curiosity,
how much is that boat worth?

173
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,143
I think it was valued at 19,000.

174
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,771
Hey, I was pretty close.

175
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,193
Uh, so, bad news.

176
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:39,531
Um, I can't buy the boat.
I don't have any money.

177
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,870
Joey! Joey, good one!

178
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,165
Good! Very good!

179
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:58,049
- So, uh, I think I'm gonna take off now.
- You can't leave, Joey!

180
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,386
You agreed to buy that boat.
It is a contract.

181
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,222
Plus, if you leave,
my boss is gonna kill me.

182
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,350
Well, what am I gonna do, Rach?
I don't have that kind of money.

183
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,269
I know. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

184
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,687
This is what we'll do.

185
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:14,649
We'll go to the next highest bidder,
and we'll let them buy it.

186
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,026
Then you're just gonna
pay the difference.

187
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,236
Okay.

188
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,448
I don't know why the kids need a
youth center anyway.

189
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:26,286
They should just watch TV after school
like I did. And I turned out fine.

190
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,413
Not great.

191
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,126
So we're hiding in the bathroom...

192
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,796
Then I sneak out. But before
Monica can, her parents come in.

193
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,007
I hid in the shower,
next thing you know...

194
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,217
...they're going at it on the floor.

195
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,677
Oh, my God!

196
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,179
I got a good one.

197
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:48,641
I once walked in on both my parents
making love to the same guy.

198
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:59,194
It's so great seeing you guys again.
I'd like to make a toast.

199
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:03,323
Uh, as a poet once said,
"In the sweetness of friendship...

200
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,618
...let there be laughter
and sharing of pleasures...

201
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,995
...for in the dew of little things...

202
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,123
...the heart finds its morning and is
refreshed."

203
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,458
Aw.

204
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,211
What?

205
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,762
Oh, my God! You guys!

206
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,016
Before you say anything, have we got a story
for you. Guess who we bumped into?

207
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,185
- Who?
- Richard!

208
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,230
Oh. Oh.

209
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,066
I thought you were going out
with Elizabeth.

210
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:42,028
I was. Uh, she was a little busy
with a water balloon fight.

211
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,532
Sometimes grownups have commitments
they can't get out of.

212
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,910
Maybe she is too young for me.

213
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,373
When I was over there,
I felt like I was a babysitter.

214
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:57,919
I finally see what you were talking
about. I don't know what to do.

215
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,506
Just weigh the good stuff about
the relationship against the bad.

216
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,885
That's what I did when I first started
weighing stuff.

217
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:11,933
Okay, um, bad stuff.
I'm 12 years older than she is.

218
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,893
If school finds out, you're fired.

219
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,063
- She's leaving for three months.
- For camp.

220
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,567
Okay, good stuff. Um...

221
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,695
Well, she's sweet and pretty and...

222
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,949
The only question you need to ask
is, do you see a future?

223
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,202
Do you see yourself marrying her?

224
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,956
My God. You did it already.
You married her, didn't you?

225
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,336
No, I didn't do that.
It's just...

226
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:45,842
Honestly, no,
I don't see a big future with her.

227
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,220
Okay, I think that's your answer.

228
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,390
I gotta talk to her.
I hate this part.

229
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,018
Forget Elizabeth.
If you're not careful...

230
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,563
...you may not get married
at all this year.

231
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,735
Rach, Rach.

232
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,446
- Next highest bidder is at table one.
- Great.

233
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,866
The guy who got the Paris trip
is at table four.

234
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,368
You care about the guy
who won the Paris trip?

235
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,703
It's a trip for two.

236
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,997
Excuse me.

237
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:25,423
Excuse me. Is the person who won
the Paris trip at this table?

238
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,092
- That was me.
- Oh. Enchanté.

239
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,724
Uh, is there
a Mr. Bowmont at this table?

240
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,726
- That's me.
- Ah.

241
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,980
Hello. This is your
lucky day, Mr. Bowmont.

242
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:45,193
The, uh, Gentleman Daysailer
has become available again.

243
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,446
I believe you made a bid of $18,000?

244
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,658
You have to pay that.
It's not just a guess.

245
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,538
I was actually relieved,
uh, I didn't win the boat.

246
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,499
My wife would've killed me.

247
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,001
Are you kidding?
She'll love this boat!

248
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,629
- What is your wife's name?
- It's Pam.

249
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:08,967
It's Pam. Just imagine this.
The Pam.

250
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,885
Aw.

251
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,846
I don't think she'd like that.

252
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,600
Okay. Uh, imagine this:
The Mr. Bowmont.

253
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,851
Ooh.

254
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,561
I don't think so.

255
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,773
Okay, look. Let me paint you
a little picture. All right.

256
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:28,444
You are setting sail up the Hudson.
You've got the wind in your ha... Arms.

257
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:34,534
You get all that peace and quiet
you've always wanted.

258
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,704
You get back to nature.
You can go fishing.

259
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:41,582
You get one of those hats,
people call you captain.

260
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,419
And then when you're old, Cappy.

261
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,548
What the hell. It's for a good cause.
All right!

262
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,551
- No way! It's mine!
- What?

263
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,638
The stuff you said, I want that!

264
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,558
But, Joey, you don't have $20,000!

265
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:02,395
Who cares? I'll make payments!
I want the Mr. Bowmont!

266
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,944
Oh, my God! You're back!

267
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,821
Let me see your hand!

268
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,074
Why do you want to see my hand?

269
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,036
I want to see what's in your hand,
the trash.

270
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,043
Ew, it's all dirty.
You should throw this out.

271
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,837
Okay.

272
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,592
- What did you just do?
- What happened?

273
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,262
- Richard was there. I couldn't do it.
- Oh, no.

274
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,183
I was gonna do it tomorrow and surprise her.
Now you've ruined it.

275
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,809
We didn't.

276
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,729
Who walks into a room
and asks to see a person's hands?

277
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:50,276
A palm reader, a manicurist,
a hand doctor.

278
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,529
- Glove salesman.
- Good one!

279
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,909
This is terrible.
What am I gonna do?

280
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:02,497
She only suspects something.
So just throw her off the track.

281
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:06,125
I'll make her think, uh, marriage
is the last thing on my mind.

282
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,003
Yeah. Convince her you're scared
of commitment.

283
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,881
I can do that.
I've had 30 years of practice.

284
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,092
Being you is finally gonna pay off!

285
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,137
Had to go to the basement...

286
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,974
...some idiot keeps stuffing
the chute with pizza boxes.

287
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,894
That guy's still doing that?

288
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,398
Hey. My God, let me see your hand!

289
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:33,236
No, you're too late!
She already took out the trash!

290
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:47,125
Wow. I have never had
such a healthy breakup.

291
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,628
She was such a grownup about it.

292
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:54,132
She didn't seem too immature for me.

293
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:58,344
Did I just make a huge mistake?

294
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,096
Ross? Wait!

295
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,724
Elizabeth, thank God.
I was just thinking about...

296
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,935
You suck!

297
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,186
What?

298
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,819
Okay.

299
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,780
Breakup's still on.

300
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:26,873
Here she comes.

301
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,667
Do I look like a guy
who doesn't want to get married?

302
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,335
Yeah.

303
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,130
And, also, a little like a
French guy.

304
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,135
I never noticed that before.

305
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,388
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

306
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,681
What are you up to?

307
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,934
Just hanging out.
Talking about, uh, web sites.

308
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,144
Ha.

309
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:52,440
Ahem. We saw this interesting website
about marriage.

310
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,775
How unnecessary it is.

311
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,778
How it's a way for governments
to keep tabs on you.

312
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,739
Yeah, Big Brother. Ha, ha.

313
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,408
That's a little crazy.

314
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:07,038
Although I am glad you're looking
at other things on the Internet.

315
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,709
Got me thinking, why would anybody
want to get married?

316
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:16,130
Why? To celebrate the relationship.
To solidify the commitment.

317
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,133
To declare your love for one another
to the world.

318
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,344
Eh.

319
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,097
Okay. Well, that's good to know.

320
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,977
The Mr. Bowmont's here!

321
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,528
A customer wants to compliment you.
Shall I let him in?

322
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,073
Sure! I love this part!

323
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,159
- Come on in.
- Hi.

324
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,161
Richard.

325
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,747
I'm not here to compliment the chef.

326
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,459
Oh. I hate when people come back
to compliment the chef.

327
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,045
Like I've nothing better to do.

328
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,506
What's up?

329
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,384
It was great seeing you
the other night.

330
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,469
Good to see you too.

331
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,764
Come down here
to tell me that?

332
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,434
No. Came here to tell you
something else.

333
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,481
Came here to tell you
I still love you.
