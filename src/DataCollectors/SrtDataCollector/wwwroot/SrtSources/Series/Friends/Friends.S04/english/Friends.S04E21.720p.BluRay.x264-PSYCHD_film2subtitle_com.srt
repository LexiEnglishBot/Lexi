1
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:06,547
It seems like all of a sudden,
so much is happening.

2
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:09,174
I know.
Ross is getting married.

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,261
Phoebe's making people.

4
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:15,264
- Everybody's doing stuff.
- We just sit here.

5
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:17,975
If I died, the only way
people would know I was here...

6
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,686
...would be by the ass print
on this chair.

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,024
Look, we have to do something.
Okay? Something huge.

8
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,027
We could climb Mount Everest.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,739
No, no. Not something stupid.
Something huge.

10
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:34,199
No, no, no.
I saw an ad for this video.

11
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,077
People climb that thing every day.
We could totally do that.

12
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,081
Why not?
I mean, it's just climbing.

13
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,833
It's just steep.

14
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,043
Yeah.

15
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:48,255
We're going to Everest. Okay?
It'd be nice to leave an ass print on Everest.

16
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,466
- Hey.
- Hey.

17
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,718
- What's up?
- We're gonna climb Mount Everest.

18
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,553
- Yeah, baby.
- Really?

19
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,513
I looked into that.

20
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:02,186
Yeah, but, I mean, it costs like $60,000,
and, you know, you could die. And...

21
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,188
And you would die.

22
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,191
Oh, well.

23
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,735
We could get that Everest video.

24
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,530
Yeah, we could do that without,
you know, risking our lives at all.

25
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:17,409
While we're down at the video store,
we could rent Die Hard.

26
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,538
Oh. You know what?
I just remembered.

27
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,666
That Everest thing is only available
through mail order.

28
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:25,918
Oh, well.

29
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,420
So you guys will stay here
and hang out with me?

30
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,547
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,675
But I'll tell you, one of these days...

32
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:37,096
...we're gonna get off our butts
and rent Die Hard again.

33
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,889
Yeah, we are.

34
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,817
So, what did we decide?
Does your uncle Nathan get an invite or not?

35
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,027
Oh, God.
Nobody likes him.

36
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:38,323
And he's so cheap. He'd never fly
to London in a million years.

37
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,700
Yeah, invite him.

38
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,537
Hey, did I do these neat enough?

39
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,707
- Yeah, they're fine.
- Yeah?

40
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,543
If anyone asks,
we'll say that Ben addressed them.

41
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,088
Oh. So you invited Rachel then?

42
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:54,840
Sure, why not?

43
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,717
- Really?
- Yeah.

44
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:01,555
Well, I don't think I'd be comfortable
having any of my old lovers there.

45
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,808
Wait, wait, wait.
Do you think we shouldn't invite her?

46
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,811
Oh, no, no, Ross,
you know I absolutely adore Rachel.

47
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,857
It's just that, well, I thought
it might be a bit awkward for you.

48
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,526
But it's absolutely your decision.

49
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,445
- More tea?
- Yeah, sure.

50
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,073
- Earl Grey?
- Huh?

51
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,159
Fine, yeah,
invite whoever you want.

52
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:32,336
I don't want to be single, okay?
I just want to be married again.

53
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,635
And I just want a million dollars.

54
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,179
Rachel?

55
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,390
- Oh, God, Monica. Hi. Thank God.
- Hi.

56
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,896
Okay. Everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

57
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,857
This is everybody.
This is Chandler and Phoebe...

58
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,150
...and Joey.

59
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,194
- Do you remember my brother, Ross?
- Sure.

60
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,488
- Hey. Oh, God.
- Hi.

61
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,075
You know, back in high school...

62
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,703
...I had a, um, major crush on you.

63
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,499
- I knew.
- You did? Oh, okay.

64
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,544
I always figured you just thought
I was Monica's geeky brother.

65
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,381
- I did.
- Oh.

66
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,759
Listen, do you think...?

67
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,554
And try not to let my intense
vulnerability become a factor here.

68
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,518
Do you think it would be okay
if I asked you out sometime maybe?

69
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,561
Yeah.

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,772
Maybe.

71
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,108
Okay.

72
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,235
Okay, maybe I will.

73
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,531
See, I see, uh...

74
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,992
...big passion in your future.

75
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:46,994
- Really?
- I do.

76
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:50,914
Oh, Ross, you're so great.
Aw...

77
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,467
It's never gonna happen.

78
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,179
Okay, I have a question.

79
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,767
Well, uh, actually,
it's not so much a question...

80
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,478
...as more of a general wondering...

81
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,106
...ment.

82
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,899
- Okay.
- Okay.

83
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,905
Um, well, for a while now,
I've been wanting to, um...

84
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,491
- Oh...
- Yes. Yes. That's...

85
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,036
- Look at that little kitty.
- That's right.

86
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,954
- What?
- That little kitty.

87
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,459
Top of the world looking

88
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,252
Down on creation

89
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:42,924
And the only explanation I can find

90
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:48,055
Listen, missy, if you want this cart,
you're gonna have to take me with it.

91
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,143
Yes.

92
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,228
- Did you see that?
- You were incredible.

93
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,023
A brand-new woman,
ladies and gentlemen.

94
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,650
Thank you. I could not
have done this without you.

95
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,242
Okay, um... Uh...

96
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,036
More clothes in the dryer?

97
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,205
- Oh.
- Oh!

98
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,664
I'm fine. I'm fine.

99
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,542
You had no right to tell me
you ever had feelings for me.

100
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,878
- What?
- I was doing great with Julie...

101
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,463
...before I found out about you.

102
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,757
I was doing great
before I found out about you.

103
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,176
You think it's easy for me
to see you with Julie?

104
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,221
Well, the point is
I don't need this right now.

105
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,139
Okay? It's too late.

106
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,309
I'm with somebody else.
I'm happy. This ship has sailed.

107
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,978
All right, fine.
Go ahead and do that, all right, Ross?

108
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,522
I don't need your stupid ship.

109
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,524
- Good.
- Good.

110
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,778
Oh!

111
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,005
Oh.

112
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:32,284
Do you realize this is the first time
I'm doing something I care about?

113
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,537
This is the first time I'm doing
something I'm actually good at.

114
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,164
If you don't get that...

115
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,958
I get that. I get that bigtime.
And I'm happy for you...

116
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,502
...but I'm tired of having a relationship
with your answering machine.

117
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,297
- I don't know what to do anymore.
- Well, neither do I.

118
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:46,965
Is this about Mark?

119
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,719
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, it's not.

120
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,262
Oh, my God.

121
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,724
I cannot keep having this same fight
over and over again, Ross.

122
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,643
No. You're making this too hard.

123
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,979
I'm making this too hard?
What do you want me to do?

124
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,108
I don't know. I don't know.
Look, maybe we should just take a break.

125
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,278
You're right. Let's take a break.
Let's cool off, okay?

126
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,156
Let's get some frozen yogurt
or something.

127
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,908
No.

128
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,660
A break from us.

129
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,252
- Do I know why we're rushing?
- You know the girlfriend I told you about?

130
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,380
It turns out that she, uh, wants
to get back together with me.

131
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,632
Oh, I found it!

132
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,967
- That's so great for you guys.
- Yeah.

133
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,388
- Good luck with your girlfriend.
- Oh, thank you... Ah, hey.

134
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,811
Rachel!

135
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,980
Hi. Oh...

136
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,192
- You got my message?
- You are right on time.

137
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,861
So, what do you say?
Can I be your girlfriend again?

138
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,613
Yes, you can very much.

139
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,032
Ah!

140
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,327
- I want you to leave. Get out.
- No. No.

141
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,371
I wanna stay.
I wanna talk about this.

142
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,873
All right. How was she?

143
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,291
Oh-oh.

144
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,005
- What?
- Was she good?

145
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,257
Don't answer that.

146
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:16,012
You said you wanted to talk about it.
Let's talk about it. How was she?

147
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,265
She was...

148
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,183
- Awful.
- She was not good, not good.

149
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,143
Nothing compared to you.

150
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,020
She was different.

151
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,605
- Ooh!
- Oh-oh.

152
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,733
Good different?

153
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,070
Nobody likes change.

154
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,364
Oh! Just stop.

155
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,951
The way you owned up to everything...

156
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:42,539
...it just showed me how much
you've grown, you know?

157
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,334
I mean, my mom never thought
this would work out.

158
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:51,256
She was all,
"Once a cheater, always a cheater."

159
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,508
Mm-hm.

160
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,051
Oh...

161
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,680
I just wish we hadn't lost
those four months.

162
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:03,685
But if time was what you needed
just to gain a little perspective...

163
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,524
We were on a break!

164
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,870
You seem to really like her.

165
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,832
Yeah, but what am I gonna do?
We agreed it was gonna be a two-week thing.

166
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,792
You know? No commitment.

167
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:33,131
Ross, that girl just spent
the entire evening talking to your friends...

168
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,800
...asking to hear stories about you...

169
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,678
...looking through Monica's photo albums.

170
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,973
I mean, you don't do that
if you're just in it for two weeks.

171
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,267
You think? Heh.

172
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,563
You've got like 14 hours
until she has to be at the airport.

173
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,107
And you're sitting here
in a hallway...

174
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,653
...with a 28-year-old cheerleader
with a fat lip.

175
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,283
- Yeah, you're right.
- Yeah.

176
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,047
Oh, this is so amazing.

177
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,966
I can't believe my brother's
getting married, and in London.

178
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,219
It's so romantic.

179
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,555
Hey, pretty smart.

180
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,848
Tissue paper.

181
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,518
You're at the wedding.
You have to cry.

182
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,145
Handkerchief?
No, I got my invitation.

183
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,108
Oh, look, isn't this adorable?

184
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,111
Ross let Ben address mine.

185
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,987
- Hello.
- Hey.

186
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,197
- Hey.
- Hey.

187
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,950
Hey, did you get your invitation
to Ross' wedding?

188
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,077
No.

189
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,206
Don't worry, man, I get to bring a guest.
We'll show him.

190
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,375
I'm so jealous you're all going.

191
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,753
I can't believe I never knew
you can't fly in your third trimester.

192
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,213
- I never knew that.
- I didn't, either.

193
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,965
I knew that.

194
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:00,218
So didn't know that.
But you should see your faces.

195
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,055
- Hi, guys. What's up?
- Hey.

196
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,932
We're hanging out.

197
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,274
What's this?
Is this Ross' wedding invitation?

198
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,027
Maybe that's the one
we should have actually hidden.

199
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,865
Oh, no. No, you guys, come on.
You don't have to do that.

200
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,908
I'm happy for him.

201
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,828
I am. I really... I'm... I'm ha...

202
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,663
I'll work on it.

203
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:30,665
I'm sorry, honey.

204
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,917
Mm.

205
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,628
Rach, you're going to come though,
aren't you?

206
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,423
Oh, honey, I don't know. I...

207
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,260
This isn't one of those
"If she doesn't come, we don't come"?

208
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,054
Because I already bought my ticket...

209
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,352
You know what would be real weird?
If you weren't there.

210
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:56,357
- Just say you'll think about it, okay?
- No, I'll think about it. Yeah.

211
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,279
- Who's this from?
- That's Ross'.

212
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,530
Oh.

213
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,329
Oh, my God.

214
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,664
He remembered.

215
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,082
Remembered what?

216
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:17,295
It was like months ago.
We were walking by this antique store.

217
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:21,049
I saw this pin, and I told him
it was just like one my grandmother had...

218
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,635
...when I was a little girl. Oh.

219
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,137
I can't believe he remembered.

220
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,806
This must have cost him a fortune.

221
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,182
I can't believe he did this.

222
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,101
Remember back in college
when he fell in love with Carol...

223
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,396
...and bought her
that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?

224
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,690
What did you just say?

225
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,913
Oh, my God.

226
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,291
Flight number 457 from Beijing now arriving.

227
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,547
Oh, my God.

228
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,967
- We were in school together.
- We haven't seen each other since then.

229
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,595
Well, I land in China.
Guess who's in charge of the dig?

230
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,972
Julie!

231
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,016
Julie! Isn't that great?

232
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:17,188
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

233
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,318
Oh, that is so sweet.

234
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,572
No... Heh.

235
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,782
No... Okay.
No, you hang up.

236
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,952
No, you...
Okay. Okay.

237
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,997
One, two, three.

238
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,500
You didn't hang up either.

239
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,003
- She didn't hang up.
- She didn't hang up either.

240
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,883
Okay, no.

241
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,301
No, you hang up.

242
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,012
You. You. Y...

243
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,143
Ross, hi.

244
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,145
It's Rachel.

245
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:01,190
I'm just calling to say
that, um, everything's fine.

246
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,651
And I'm really happy for you...

247
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,070
...and your cat.

248
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,784
So obviously, I am over you.

249
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,121
I am over you.

250
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:20,376
And that, my friend,
is what they call closure.

251
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,923
Rach, I got a message from you.

252
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,592
Oh, my God, no.
Hang up the phone. Give me the phone.

253
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,138
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
Give me the phone!

254
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,729
You're over me?

255
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,731
Oh, God.

256
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,150
- What...? You're, uh?
- Oh, God.

257
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,443
You're over me?

258
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,323
- Oh, my God.
- When were you...

259
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,200
...under me?

260
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,621
Basically, ahem...

261
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,123
...lately, I've, uh...

262
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,461
Ahem. I've sort of had feelings for you.

263
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,672
Okay, I need to lie down.

264
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,675
He broke up with Julie.

265
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,262
Well, go hug her, for God's sakes.

266
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,975
- Really?
- Really.

267
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,144
It's always been you, Rach.

268
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,105
Oh, God.

269
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,820
Oh...

270
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,949
Listen, I'm sorry
I had to work tonight.

271
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,368
Oh, that's okay.

272
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,371
- You're worth the wait.
- Oh.

273
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,790
And I don't just mean tonight.

274
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:48,297
I never dreamed
That I'd meet somebody like you

275
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:54,762
I never dreamed
That I'd lose somebody like you

276
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:05,398
No, I don't want to fall in love

277
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,985
Oh, God!

278
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,446
Oh. Honey.

279
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,239
Oh, that's okay.

280
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:17,243
Oh, no, you just rolled over
the juice box.

281
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,249
Gunther, please tell me
you didn't say anything to Rachel...

282
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,501
...about me and the girl
from the copy place.

283
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,420
I'm sorry.

284
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,589
Was I not supposed to?

285
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,097
You're the one who ended it.

286
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:42,310
Yeah, because I was mad at you.
Not because I stopped loving you.

287
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,645
You still love me?

288
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,522
No.

289
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:52,445
What does this mean? What do you...?
I mean, do you want to get back together?

290
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,156
No. Maybe.

291
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,617
- I don't... I don't know.
- What?

292
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,870
I just... I feel...

293
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:14,383
I can't believe I even thought of getting back
together with you. We are so over.

294
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,512
Fine by me!

295
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,725
And, hey, just so you know,
it's not that common...

296
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:26,604
...it doesn't happen to every guy,
and it is a big deal!

297
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,440
I knew it!

298
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:44,038
Rachel's coming up.
Doesn't she look pretty, Jack?

299
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,833
Oh, my God.

300
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,752
- This is us getting ready for the prom.
- Oh!

301
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,004
You know what?
We don't have to watch this.

302
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,714
- Yeah, we do.
- Come on.

303
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:54,924
Fun.

304
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,300
Get a shot of Monica.

305
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,177
Wait, how do you zoom out?

306
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,513
There she is.

307
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,809
Shut up.
The camera adds 10 pounds.

308
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,687
Huh, so how many cameras
are actually on you?

309
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,690
Dad, turn it off.

310
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,191
- It is off.
- Yeah.

311
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,943
Right, Ross?

312
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,783
Looking good, Mr. Kotter.

313
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,123
I can't go to my own prom without a date.
I can't. It's too late.

314
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,626
If you're not going,
then I don't wanna go either.

315
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,837
I have a wonderful idea.

316
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,298
You should take Rachel to the prom.

317
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,258
We've seen enough.
Let's turn it off.

318
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,553
- I want to see.
- Fine, I'm not going to watch, all right?

319
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:41,846
Come on, kid. Let's go.

320
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,765
Are you handsome.

321
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,601
Let's show them.

322
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,316
- Okay, Dad.
- Rachel, ready or not.

323
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,651
Here comes your knight in shining...

324
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:56,944
Oh, no.

325
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:01,908
- Bye. Don't wait up.
- Okay, Chip, let's go.

326
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,827
Oh, dear.

327
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,662
Jack, how do I turn this off?

328
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,042
I can't believe you did that.

329
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,586
Yeah, well...

330
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,439
See? He's her lobster.

331
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,159
No.

332
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,162
- You're really not going?
- Yeah.

333
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,748
It's just going to be too hard.

334
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,376
You know, I mean...

335
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,419
...it's Ross.

336
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,714
How can I watch him get married?

337
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,302
You know?
It's just for the best, you know? It is.

338
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,305
Plus somebody's
got to stay here with Phoebe.

339
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,308
She's going to be pretty big by then...

340
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,520
...and she'll need someone
to help her tie her shoes.

341
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,940
Drive her to the hospital
in case she goes into labor.

342
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,484
You don't have a car.

343
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,153
- And your license expired.
- I know.

344
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,616
Yeah. See, there's so much to do,
and I have so little time to do it in.

345
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,457
Check this out.

346
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:37,128
It says there's a place you can go
to rent videos of all the museums.

347
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,214
"It's almost as good as being there."

348
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:44,135
It's better. You can't go to a museum
in your underwear.

349
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,555
Well, you could,
but probably just the one time.

350
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,809
I bet we could get videos
of all the sights...

351
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,604
...get a VCR in our hotel room,
we'd never even have to go outside.

352
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,190
If we do that,
we've got to rent Die Hard.

353
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,070
Oh-ho, I bet the British version is good.
