1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,172
Ross, when's this comet thing start?

2
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:10,092
Well, technically, it started
7 billion years ago.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,677
- No, no.
- Oh, God.

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,805
Okay. Fine, I'll stop.
No teaching, okay?

5
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:18,851
We'll just watch the pretty light
streaking across the sky.

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,519
- Okay?
- Okay.

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,399
Whose official name is Bapstein-King.
Okay! Okay!

8
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:30,404
There it is. Oh, look at that!

9
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:33,532
Isn't Mother Nature amazing?

10
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,077
That's a plane.

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,915
Well, all right, 1700 bags
of peanuts flying that high...

12
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,917
...that's pretty amazing too.

13
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,757
- I wonder if you can see my apartment.
- No, you can't.

14
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,510
- What?
- I don't know.

15
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,514
Man, look at all those stars.

16
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:02,895
Infinite space. It really makes you
wonder, doesn't it?

17
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,481
- Know what else makes you wonder?
- Huh?

18
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,317
Check out the rack on that chick.

19
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,572
We've been out here for two hours...

20
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:59,076
...and we haven't seen any
stupid comets. Can we go now?

21
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,579
I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.

22
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,835
No, I'm not.

23
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,630
Then why are you wearing
Monica's jacket?

24
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,092
Because it's flattering!

25
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,887
Come on, Monica. Come on, Monica.

26
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,433
- We're taking off too. We rented a movie.
- Oh, I won't say no to a movie.

27
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,395
Oh, Pheebs, we just actually
wanted to be alone.

28
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,772
- Shh. Get me out of here.
- Oh, okay.

29
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,652
- Hey, Ross.
- What?

30
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,571
- Check this out.
- Is it the comet?

31
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,867
No. Look, there's a bug
stuck in tar right here.

32
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,119
I can't believe...

33
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,872
I bring you to see
the Bapstein-King comet...

34
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,583
...one of nature's
most spectacular phenomena...

35
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:52,379
...and all you care about are bugs
stuck in tar and some woman.

36
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,926
You know, there's two women, dude.

37
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,888
Show me where.

38
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,765
Right... Right up here.

39
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,983
Joey, where's the pipe
that was holding the door open?

40
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,443
I don't know.

41
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,661
Yeah, I do.

42
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,499
- Joey!
- What? Hey, don't look at me!

43
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:34,463
You wanted to come up here and look
for some stupid Burger King comet.

44
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,550
It's called the
Bapstein-King comet, okay?

45
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:42,304
Hey, Bapstein was a very
well-respected astronomer from...

46
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,139
No! No!

47
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,141
No!

48
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,444
- Monica.
- She's sleeping.

49
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,491
I know. Just a quick question.

50
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:07,037
Which one was Deep Impact
and which one was Armageddon?

51
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,668
Deep Impact was the one
with Robert Duvall.

52
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:16,546
Armageddon is what's going
to happen to you if you wake me up.

53
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,842
Sorry, I just can't sleep.

54
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,095
Ooh!

55
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,768
Where's that book you're reading
with two women who are ice-skating...

56
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,521
...and wearing those hats
with the flowers on it.

57
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,857
Because every time I look
at that cover, I'm like:

58
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:41,196
It's in the living room,
where there's also a light...

59
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,573
...and no one will
kick you in the shin.

60
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,493
What?

61
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,036
Ow!

62
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:02,092
Please don't be a spaceship.
Please don't be a spaceship.

63
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,727
Oh, thank God.

64
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,007
Hm.

65
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,597
How could you be beeping?
I just disconnected you!

66
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,432
I took out your battery! How can...?

67
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:52,976
Don't interrupt me!

68
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:57,189
Monica! Monica!

69
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,066
Come on!

70
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,154
I can't believe this!

71
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:08,825
All right, well, I guess we know
what we have to do to get down.

72
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,994
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice.

73
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,290
Help us! Please, help us!

74
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,503
We're stuck up on the roof,
and we can't get down!

75
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,381
Ross.

76
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,593
I was thinking we'd just
go down the fire escape.

77
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,472
I know. I wasn't finished.

78
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,727
But don't worry!

79
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:39,898
We're gonna go down the fire escape!

80
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,493
Shh-shh-shh!

81
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:59,501
I'm sorry, I thought I'd make some
warm milk and it would help me sleep.

82
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,044
With a wok?

83
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,257
I thought my boring book was gonna
put you to sleep.

84
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,843
It got interesting.

85
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,178
Damn you, Oprah!

86
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,182
Here, let me make the milk.
I'm up anyway.

87
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,852
You know what we could do
now that we're up?

88
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,855
We could just talk
to each other all night long.

89
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,524
Like when we were first going out.
It'd be fun.

90
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,568
- Okay, that does sound fun.
- Yeah.

91
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:28,280
So how bummed were you
when the second sister died, huh?

92
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,407
The second sister dies?!

93
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,746
No.

94
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,585
No, I was talking
about the book I was reading.

95
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,881
The second sister dies in
Archie and Jughead Double Digest?

96
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,217
That's correct.

97
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,810
Want to go in the bedroom?
It's more comfortable.

98
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,729
- Sure.
- Okay.

99
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,609
Oh, wait, did you send
those contracts to Milan?

100
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:10,322
- If this is your idea of sexy talk...
- No.

101
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,074
Seriously. Did you overnight
the contracts I gave you?

102
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,242
What contracts?

103
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,246
Please tell me this is just one
of your jokes that I don't get. Heh, heh.

104
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,581
Like what?

105
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,834
Like the thing when you
put the phone in your pants?

106
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,838
Tag, I'm serious.
This isn't funny.

107
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,633
Those contracts had to go out today.

108
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,843
You didn't give me any contracts.

109
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,138
Yes, I did. I put a little
Post-it on it that said:

110
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,226
"Must go out today," and I
underlined "today" three times.

111
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:43,939
Then I put a little heart in the corner
because I didn't wanna seem too bossy.

112
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,274
You never gave them to me.

113
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:51,154
If we went to the office, you would see
those contracts sitting on your desk.

114
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:55,450
No, I'd see you looking embarrassed
because they are not on my desk.

115
00:08:55,618 --> 00:09:00,330
Maybe I'm embarrassed because you
talk on the phone with your crotch.

116
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,458
- You want to go to the office now?
- No.

117
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,836
Come on, it's late.
We're not going down to the office.

118
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,840
Yeah, I understand. I wouldn't
want to be proved wrong either.

119
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,301
All right, get your coat!

120
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:18,557
Oh! When did you unhook this?
Nice work!

121
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,568
It won't go down any further.
It's stuck.

122
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,320
We'll just have to jump.

123
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,866
Yep. Now, we're gonna have
to make sure to land...

124
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,495
...to the right of that
patch of ice, okay?

125
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,374
Not hit the dumpster
on the other side.

126
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:50,422
And try to avoid that weird
brownish-red stuff in the middle.

127
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,175
So when you get down there...

128
00:09:56,178 --> 00:10:01,057
...you go up to the roof
and you let me in.

129
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,686
- Whoa. Wait a minute. I have to do it?
- Yeah. You'll be fine.

130
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,522
It'll be just like
bungee jumping, you know?

131
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:11,901
But instead of bouncing back up,
you won't.

132
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,365
Well, what if I smack
my head on the concrete?

133
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:21,077
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you, Joey.
It's a possibility.

134
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:27,709
I don't know. Tell you what,
let's flip to see who does it.

135
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:31,254
- You call it in the air, all right?
- Oh, all right. Tail. Oh!

136
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:38,428
- Can you see what it is?
- No.

137
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,931
- Okay. Well, you be careful.
- No. No, Ross, stop.

138
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,266
I'm not jumping.

139
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,604
Look, I have an audition tomorrow,
and I can't go if I break my leg.

140
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:52,442
Well, I'm not jumping. I have a son.
He won't have a father if I die.

141
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,569
So it looks like we're even.

142
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,577
Okay, so this wire...

143
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,748
...is connected to this wire,
which plugs into here.

144
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,710
Okay, so to get the beeping to stop,
all I have to do...

145
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,255
Okay.

146
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,933
Well done, Pheebs.

147
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,607
What do you want from me?!

148
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,114
Here's your milk.
What should we talk about?

149
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,993
What? What? What?

150
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:48,665
Oh, were you sleeping, sweetie?
I'm sorry. Here.

151
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,714
Okay. Feel free to look...

152
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,800
...but I'm telling you
those contracts are not on this desk.

153
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,636
How could you know?
Look at this mess, Tag.

154
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,973
This is what I'm talking about.
You have to be more organized.

155
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:09,144
You've got newspapers,
you've got magazines, you... Oh!

156
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,105
And who's this chippy?

157
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,983
A little young for you, but whatever.

158
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,317
That's my sister.

159
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,155
Really? Very cute braces.

160
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:24,242
Anyway, you know what?
The point is, Tag, start looking...

161
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,704
...because you're gonna find
those contracts on your desk.

162
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,334
So when do you imagine you gave
them to me? Morning or afternoon?

163
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:37,714
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner
came into my office after lunch...

164
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,384
...he put them on my desk,
and then I put a Post-it on it...

165
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,512
...that said:

166
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,724
"Must go out today."

167
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,562
So you just keep looking
in there, all right?

168
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,862
Not here.

169
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,531
Puzzler.

170
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,745
Bit of a puzzle.

171
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,999
Why don't you check the copy room?
Maybe the contracts are in there.

172
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,044
- How could I have left them in the copy room?
- I don't know.

173
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,713
How can your genitals
make phone calls?

174
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,218
Okay? It's not a perfect world.
Just go, please?

175
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,054
- Fine.
- Thank you.

176
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,902
Hello?

177
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,574
I still don't get it.

178
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,956
You still awake?

179
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,208
Yeah. You?

180
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,254
You do know that was me
that just said that, right?

181
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,717
Hey.

182
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,761
As long as we're both up...

183
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,430
Yeah?

184
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,603
I hope you're not thinking
about cleaning the living room.

185
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,820
Man, I'm starving. What the hell
was I thinking at dinner?

186
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,615
"Do you want soup or salad?"
Both, always order both.

187
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:33,955
You know, I'm looking,
and I don't think anyone's home here.

188
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,791
I say we just break the window...

189
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,293
...crawl through...

190
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,837
...and you know, explain later.

191
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,964
- No one's home?
- I don't think so.

192
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,299
Hello?

193
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,850
So when you get in there...

194
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:05,153
Okay. This is where
you and I part ways.

195
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,613
Noisy bitch!

196
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,162
Oh, what? What are you doing?

197
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,831
Do you know what just happened?

198
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,836
Yeah. We had sex
and then we fell asleep.

199
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:27,258
No. We were in the middle of sex...

200
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,553
...and you fell asleep.

201
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:35,016
No. No, that's not true.

202
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,477
No, best time ever.

203
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:42,023
Yeah. You rock my world.

204
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,861
- Monica?
- What?

205
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,657
I was giving you some of
my best moves, and you missed it.

206
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:55,370
So please wake up
so we can do it right.

207
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,374
Okay. Okay. I'm ready.

208
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,668
- Come on, big fella.
- Okay.

209
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,920
- Give me the good stuff.
- Yeah.

210
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,716
No, no, no. Don't fall asleep.

211
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,096
Okay, I'm going
to make you some coffee.

212
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:19,394
Well, I probably won't spill coffee
grounds all over the kitchen floor.

213
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,229
Okay, I'm up. I'm up.

214
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,735
Hi. I got you some coffee to...

215
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,238
So you got anything for me?

216
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,240
- Still no luck.
- Oh, my God.

217
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,243
You checked your entire desk
and all the drawers?

218
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,954
- Want me to check again?
- I wish you would.

219
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,916
Well, no, it's not in there.

220
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,918
How about that drawer?

221
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,263
Well, it's not out here.
Any chance it could be in your office?

222
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,146
I don't know.

223
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,065
I mean, let me check.

224
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,492
Any luck?

225
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,163
Can I see you in my office for a minute?

226
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,664
Yeah.

227
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,959
You found them!

228
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,963
I'm not even gonna gloat.

229
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:32,467
- I'm just really relieved it's...
- You put these on my desk.

230
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,801
- I did not.
- Oh, really?

231
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,095
So they slid out of your bottom drawer...

232
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,973
...crawled across the floor,
then jumped onto my desk?

233
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,976
How did you know
they were in my bottom drawer?

234
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,775
I am so hot for you right now.

235
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,583
Oh, my God!
How did you get back here?

236
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,585
Phoebe Buffay?

237
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,756
Fire Alarm?

238
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,723
Oh, hi, Officer Fireman.
Can I help you?

239
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,850
Your fire alarm was in the trash.

240
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,936
- That's not mine.
- Yes, it is.

241
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,104
How do you know?

242
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,232
If you dump a fire alarm,
don't use a blanket that says:

243
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,401
"Property of Phoebe Buffay,
not Monica."

244
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,113
Do you have a search warrant?

245
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,783
Because the last time I checked,
this was still America.

246
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,912
Please reattach it.
It's against the law to disconnect them.

247
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:47,208
Fine. But please, God, tell me
how to stop it from going off?

248
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,001
Press the reset button.

249
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,839
There's a reset button?
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

250
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,925
Oh. There's a reset button?

251
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,177
My God!

252
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,971
Why didn't I see that?

253
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,976
Reset button. Reset button.

254
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,396
Where is there a reset button?
Oh, here it is! Oh!

255
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,994
God!

256
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,667
- Okay, you have a good grip?
- Yeah.

257
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,712
Okay, I'm gonna start
to climb down you now.

258
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,675
- All right, just hurry up.
- Okay.

259
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,304
Now, should I climb down your front
so we're face to face...

260
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:45,016
...or should I climb down
your back so we're...

261
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,976
...butt to face?

262
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,688
- Face to face.
- I like face to face.

263
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,400
- Okay, here I come.
- All right.

264
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,364
Oh, my... How much do you weigh, Ross?

265
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:06,495
I prefer not to answer that right now.
I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.

266
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,339
When we talked about face to face...

267
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,425
...I don't think we thought it
all the way through.

268
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,888
- What do you want me to do?
- Just shimmy down me and drop.

269
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,686
- Hi.
- Hi.

270
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:36,067
You know, maybe I should hang,
and you should climb down me.

271
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,862
Yeah? Maybe we should talk
about that for a little while!

272
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,992
- It still looks pretty far.
- It's not that far. Just drop.

273
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,953
Do not rush me!

274
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:59,715
Ross, my pants are starting to come down,
and I'm not wearing any underwear.

275
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:02,843
Whoa!

276
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:07,807
Ow! My ankle!
I really hurt my ankle!

277
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:11,560
I think I twisted it when...
Ooh, a quarter!

278
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,777
That really was
some of your best work.

279
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,195
I told you.

280
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,492
I can't believe it.

281
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:30,830
I've only got two hours
until I call in sick for work.

282
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,332
I have to be up in seven minutes.

283
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:38,546
Well, you're not gonna believe this,
but if you have seven minutes...

284
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,840
Really?

285
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,758
You want to?

286
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,429
Okay. You get the vacuum cleaner.
I'll get the furniture polish.
