1
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:06,828
What are you looking at?

2
00:00:06,995 --> 00:00:11,082
A poster for that WWI movie I'm in.
Check it out.

3
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:13,710
Wow! It looks really violent!

4
00:00:13,918 --> 00:00:16,254
I know. I'm coming soon
to a theater near you.

5
00:00:16,421 --> 00:00:19,174
I'm in THX.
I'm unsuitable for children!

6
00:00:20,884 --> 00:00:24,762
- I cannot wait to see this.
- It's generating Oscar buzz.

7
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:28,308
- I started that!
- I thought I did!

8
00:00:28,516 --> 00:00:30,602
I just talked to my agent...

9
00:00:30,852 --> 00:00:33,188
...and the premiere is next week
and you're all invited!

10
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:36,983
- Will we take a limo?
- Sure!

11
00:00:37,442 --> 00:00:39,652
I love taking limos when nobody died.

12
00:00:41,362 --> 00:00:43,531
Well, I won't be able to come.

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,494
For those who haven't checked
their calendars, today's my due date.

14
00:00:48,703 --> 00:00:53,583
I want to thank you guys
for how great you've been during this.

15
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:58,046
I couldn't have done it without you.
I loved these last 9 months.

16
00:00:58,213 --> 00:01:00,548
I'm looking forward
to the next part...

17
00:01:00,965 --> 00:01:03,468
...but I am really gonna miss
being pregnant.

18
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,684
That's right. Still no baby.

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,437
Come on, people, make some room.

20
00:01:14,604 --> 00:01:19,025
Uh, sweetie, maybe you'd be
more comfortable here.

21
00:01:20,193 --> 00:01:21,778
You.

22
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:27,408
Like you haven't done enough.

23
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:32,914
I know you're miserable.
I wish there was something I could do.

24
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:35,208
I wish I were a sea horse.

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,049
Because with sea horses, it's the male.
They carry the babies.

26
00:01:45,802 --> 00:01:49,556
And then also, um,
I'd be far away in the sea.

27
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:03,778
God.

28
00:02:04,404 --> 00:02:09,659
I have never been so uncomfortable
in my entire life.

29
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:12,287
I know. I remember toward the end...

30
00:02:12,453 --> 00:02:16,416
That's a great story. Tell it while
you're getting me some iced tea.

31
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:20,128
Oh...

32
00:02:20,295 --> 00:02:24,465
Oh, God, get out!
Get out, get out, get out!

33
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:28,636
Let's.

34
00:03:10,553 --> 00:03:13,473
Hey, did you have the baby yet?

35
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,478
Do you want me to sit on you?
Because I'll do it.

36
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:23,650
- What are you doing here?
- They sent me home from work.

37
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:27,362
They said, "Start your maternity
leave now. Just rest."

38
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:29,530
You know what? Screw them!

39
00:03:29,697 --> 00:03:32,533
If they don't want me there,
I'll hang out with you guys.

40
00:03:34,535 --> 00:03:36,913
Or you could do volunteer work.

41
00:03:39,457 --> 00:03:42,168
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Estelle.

42
00:03:42,377 --> 00:03:47,465
I was able to get you and one guest
tickets to your premiere.

43
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:52,470
- You told me I could have six tickets.
- I sold four on eBay.

44
00:03:54,597 --> 00:03:57,392
You'll be sitting next to HotGuy372.

45
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,355
So that's it?
I only get to bring one guest?

46
00:04:02,563 --> 00:04:05,733
Yeah. What time do you
want to pick me up?

47
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,778
Hello?

48
00:04:09,612 --> 00:04:13,074
You hear that?
I only get one extra ticket.

49
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:15,910
So somehow I have to pick
between you three and Ross.

50
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:22,792
- What about me?
- You said you didn't want to go.

51
00:04:23,084 --> 00:04:25,920
I would still like
to be acknowledged.

52
00:04:26,212 --> 00:04:29,841
- Because I'm pregnant, I'm invisible?
- Definitely not invisible.

53
00:04:33,261 --> 00:04:37,014
Ross didn't care enough
to be here, so he's out.

54
00:04:37,265 --> 00:04:41,060
- You snooze, you lose.
- He's not snoozing. He's teaching.

55
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:42,895
Well, then somebody's snoozing.

56
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:49,068
And, Joey, not that this should, uh, affect
you at all, but, um, if you pick me...

57
00:04:49,277 --> 00:04:53,448
...I was planning on wearing
a sequin dress out down to here.

58
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:58,703
- I haven't seen this dress.
- Star in a movie.

59
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,460
Pick whoever you want. Listen
to your heart. What does it tell you?

60
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:07,670
Phoebe.Phoebe.Phoebe.

61
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:11,924
Well, uh...

62
00:05:14,552 --> 00:05:16,095
I think I want to take Chandler.

63
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,015
Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.

64
00:05:22,602 --> 00:05:26,606
- You want to take me?
- Yeah, I wish I could take everybody.

65
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:29,817
But Chandler's always
supported my career.

66
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:33,488
He's paid for acting classes,
headshots and stuff.

67
00:05:33,654 --> 00:05:35,531
This will be my way
of paying you back.

68
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:39,160
So you're never actually
going to pay me back?

69
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:46,501
Just because he paid for your
headshots, you're gonna take him?

70
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:51,839
I don't think you're comprehending
just how slutty this dress is.

71
00:05:52,673 --> 00:05:57,303
It's not just the stuff he paid for.
It's everything, you know?

72
00:05:57,512 --> 00:06:01,599
He read lines with me.
He went with me on auditions.

73
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:05,102
Then he consoled me
after I didn't get parts.

74
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,856
You always believed in me, man,
even when I didn't.

75
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:12,235
I always knew you were gonna make it.
I'm so proud of you.

76
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:17,240
Thanks, that means a lot to me.

77
00:06:19,742 --> 00:06:22,370
Mon, maybe one of these guys
wants to wear your dress.

78
00:06:24,247 --> 00:06:29,418
- I'm gonna go shave. Ahem.
- Yeah, well, I'm gonna go, uh, spit.

79
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:35,925
Ugh, I have to pee.

80
00:06:36,092 --> 00:06:41,430
If I don't come out, it's because I've
choked to death on the potpourri stink.

81
00:06:43,057 --> 00:06:46,602
You hold her nose, I'll blow in her
mouth and the kid'll just...

82
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:49,272
...Out of her.

83
00:06:50,898 --> 00:06:54,110
She's a week late.
She's got to have it today.

84
00:06:54,277 --> 00:06:57,822
I don't know. I think
it's still gonna be a while.

85
00:06:57,989 --> 00:07:00,199
Hmm. Care to make it interesting?

86
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:05,121
- I bet you she'll have it tomorrow.
- You're on.

87
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:08,916
- Okay, how much?
- One hundred thousand dollars.

88
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:13,713
- How about 50 bucks?
- I'll call Zurich and move some money.

89
00:07:15,423 --> 00:07:17,842
All right, whose turn is it
to help me get up?

90
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,096
Ahem, no one's here.

91
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,808
Oh, damn it.

92
00:07:39,947 --> 00:07:45,161
This is exciting. So glamorous! People
taking our picture. How do I look?

93
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,289
- A little tall.
- What?

94
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:51,083
Would you crouch down a bit
so that I look taller?

95
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:56,297
There you go.

96
00:07:57,924 --> 00:08:00,676
It's just so glamorous.

97
00:08:04,055 --> 00:08:05,806
Oh, hey, Mon? Rach is here.

98
00:08:07,183 --> 00:08:08,601
And you're still pregnant.

99
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:13,356
I'm sorry. I know
how uncomfortable you are.

100
00:08:13,564 --> 00:08:15,566
- You know what? You look great.
- Aw.

101
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:17,234
Yeah, like 50 bucks.

102
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:26,077
I have to go pee. Apparently this baby
thinks my bladder is a squeeze toy.

103
00:08:27,912 --> 00:08:31,499
Damn it. Here's your 50 bucks.

104
00:08:31,874 --> 00:08:36,921
That's interesting that you lost.
Now, I forget, do you like to lose?

105
00:08:37,088 --> 00:08:39,340
All right, stop it.

106
00:08:39,548 --> 00:08:41,509
- Double or nothing she has it tomorrow.
- Fine.

107
00:08:41,676 --> 00:08:42,718
Okay.

108
00:08:42,927 --> 00:08:47,014
Until then, General Grant, why don't
you set up camp right there?

109
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,521
- Rachel here? We have an appointment.
- In the bathroom.

110
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:56,941
- Rach, we gotta go.
- In a minute!

111
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:02,905
People ask why we're not together.
I just don't know what to tell them.

112
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:06,784
All right, all right, let's go.

113
00:09:06,951 --> 00:09:08,577
Uh, do you want to go change first?

114
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:11,747
The doctor's keeping the office
open late for us, but if you hurry...

115
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,712
- No, I'm fine.
- You don't think that's inappropriate?

116
00:09:18,254 --> 00:09:21,507
- What?
- Good God, man. Don't anger it.

117
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:31,058
Ross, it is 100 degrees outside.
For the first time in weeks, I am...

118
00:09:31,225 --> 00:09:34,895
Fine. Whatever you want.
You're the mommy.

119
00:09:35,062 --> 00:09:37,064
Uh-uh, pal! Don't call me "Mommy."

120
00:09:37,356 --> 00:09:39,233
It's bad enough you call
your own mother that.

121
00:09:41,777 --> 00:09:44,155
I'm actually with her on this one.

122
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:54,248
I thought I knew who the enemy was...

123
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:57,585
Okay, this is it. This is
my big fight scene coming up.

124
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,174
I'm fighting for every
man in the 82nd Ground Division.

125
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:12,767
- Ross?
- Yeah?

126
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:15,186
- Can I ask you something?
- Uh-huh.

127
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:19,440
- When Carol was pregnant with Ben...
- Mm-hm?

128
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,692
...were you this irritating?

129
00:10:25,613 --> 00:10:26,614
- Wow.
- Excuse me?

130
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:28,365
Uh, nothing. You're just, uh...

131
00:10:28,532 --> 00:10:33,788
You've been a little short with me
lately. I'm not trying to irritate you.

132
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:36,791
Well, then, you must have
a natural talent for it.

133
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:42,671
The doctor will be in soon.
Why don't we not speak until then?

134
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:44,215
Okay.

135
00:10:48,636 --> 00:10:50,596
Seriously. Breathe louder, Ross.
That's great.

136
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:58,395
We should ask the doctor
if she even knows...

137
00:10:58,562 --> 00:11:03,067
...how to deliver a baby
that's half human, half pure evil!

138
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:08,322
- Hi, Dr. Long. How are you?
- Hello.

139
00:11:08,531 --> 00:11:09,573
You're nice to her.

140
00:11:09,824 --> 00:11:11,117
She has the drugs.

141
00:11:13,702 --> 00:11:16,038
- We'll do a quick check.
- Okay.

142
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:18,374
- Eight days late, huh?
- Yeah.

143
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,042
You must be getting uncomfortable.

144
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:22,837
Yeah, just a tad.

145
00:11:23,712 --> 00:11:28,717
You're 80 percent effaced.
You're on your way. It still could last a while.

146
00:11:28,968 --> 00:11:34,056
- There are ways to help things along.
- Do them!

147
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:38,853
Actually, they're things
you can do. Home remedies.

148
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:42,857
In my experience, I've found
some are very effective.

149
00:11:43,023 --> 00:11:48,070
- Well, we are ready to try anything.
- There's an herbal tea you can drink.

150
00:11:48,237 --> 00:11:49,280
Okay.

151
00:11:49,488 --> 00:11:52,533
You can take some castor oil.
There's spicy foods.

152
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:54,535
We will do all of those.

153
00:11:54,785 --> 00:11:57,121
- Taking a long walk.
- Good. Done.

154
00:11:57,371 --> 00:12:01,000
And there's the one that's
proved most effective: sex.

155
00:12:07,047 --> 00:12:09,008
You've got to be kidding me.

156
00:12:24,315 --> 00:12:27,526
Good job, Joe! Well done! Top-notch!

157
00:12:28,194 --> 00:12:31,447
- You liked it'? You really liked it?
- Oh, yeah!

158
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:36,160
- Well, which part exactly?
- The whole thing! Here we go!

159
00:12:36,368 --> 00:12:38,746
No, no, no. Give me some specifics.

160
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:43,000
I loved the specifics.
The specifics were the best part.

161
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:48,255
Hey, what about the scene with
the kangaroo? Did you like that part?

162
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:54,929
I was surprised to see a kangaroo
in a World War I epic.

163
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:56,931
You fell asleep!

164
00:12:58,432 --> 00:13:03,145
There was no kangaroo!
They didn't take any of my suggestions!

165
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,694
- Thanks for coming. See you later.
- Don't go. I'm so sorry.

166
00:13:10,945 --> 00:13:13,989
Look, this guy fell asleep!
He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!

167
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:18,244
Or call an ambulance!

168
00:13:21,664 --> 00:13:22,957
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

169
00:13:23,123 --> 00:13:27,044
What did the doctor say?
Any news on when the baby will come?

170
00:13:27,211 --> 00:13:30,673
No. She gave us ideas
on how to induce labor.

171
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,258
We tried them all.

172
00:13:32,424 --> 00:13:38,222
We went for a walk, uh, we tried tea,
castor oil, spicy food. Nothing worked.

173
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:40,808
There is one thing we didn't try.

174
00:13:40,975 --> 00:13:45,104
But someone thinks that
that will open up a can of worms.

175
00:13:45,312 --> 00:13:49,149
If it's gonna help
bring the baby here, today...

176
00:13:49,316 --> 00:13:50,442
...I think you should do it.

177
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,030
- It's sex.
- Do it!

178
00:13:57,157 --> 00:14:00,828
- Monica.
- It's been a really long time for you.

179
00:14:01,036 --> 00:14:04,832
I mean, women have needs.
Do it. Get yours.

180
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:09,545
Oh, I don't know about that.

181
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:17,219
I think if the two of you had sex,
the repercussions would be catastrophic.

182
00:14:18,178 --> 00:14:20,431
All right, let's be practical.

183
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,935
If Ross isn't willing, he's not
the only guy you can have sex with.

184
00:14:26,937 --> 00:14:29,064
You could borrow Chandler.
Chandler is good.

185
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:33,610
Monica, what is the matter with you?

186
00:14:34,611 --> 00:14:38,115
- I just want the baby to be born today.
- Why today?

187
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:41,035
Okay, fine.

188
00:14:41,493 --> 00:14:46,290
I bet Phoebe that you're gonna have
the baby, and I don't want to lose.

189
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:52,129
What? While she's been going through
this hell, you've been making money?

190
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:55,257
You're betting on your friend
staying in this misery?

191
00:14:59,136 --> 00:15:02,681
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

192
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:06,352
I'm miserable. I may as well
make some money out of it.

193
00:15:07,102 --> 00:15:08,771
Can I get some of that action?

194
00:15:09,688 --> 00:15:12,024
I'm betting against all of you?

195
00:15:12,232 --> 00:15:15,194
I really feel like
tomorrow it's gonna happen.

196
00:15:15,402 --> 00:15:17,154
Okay.

197
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,622
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.

198
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:31,001
Where have you been?
I want to talk to you. I still feel bad.

199
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:34,838
Oh, no. Were you upset?
Did you lose sleep?

200
00:15:35,631 --> 00:15:36,965
I'm so sorry.

201
00:15:37,174 --> 00:15:41,011
The reason I came over is
to settle things between us.

202
00:15:41,178 --> 00:15:45,349
I wanted to pay you back
with the premiere, but you missed it.

203
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,851
- So how much do I owe you?
- What?

204
00:15:48,102 --> 00:15:51,688
- I don't want to owe you anything.
- You don't owe me.

205
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:54,483
- I don't want your...
- Ah, ah, ah. We're doing this!

206
00:15:54,691 --> 00:15:57,528
You got me my first headshots.
How much?

207
00:15:57,903 --> 00:16:02,199
- I don't know, uh, $500.
- Okay, $500. What else?

208
00:16:02,408 --> 00:16:07,204
Then there was the second set.
The infamous "booger" headshots.

209
00:16:08,288 --> 00:16:12,543
Okay, so that's another 500.
That's 500 and 500. That's...

210
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,925
- You want a calculator?
- Please.

211
00:16:21,176 --> 00:16:22,886
Here.

212
00:16:25,347 --> 00:16:27,224
Oh.

213
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,809
All right, what else?

214
00:16:29,017 --> 00:16:33,939
Well, uh, there's acting classes,
stage-combat classes, tap classes...

215
00:16:34,148 --> 00:16:37,067
Which we're still keeping
under our hats.

216
00:16:37,276 --> 00:16:41,738
That dialect coach who helped you
with a Southern accent.

217
00:16:41,905 --> 00:16:45,409
Which, after 20 hours of lessons,
still came out Jamaican.

218
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:48,704
What the hell are you talking about?

219
00:16:48,871 --> 00:16:51,832
The South will rise again, man.

220
00:16:55,544 --> 00:16:58,255
- Yes, money well-spent.
- Yeah.

221
00:16:58,464 --> 00:17:00,632
Okay, what else? Rent.

222
00:17:00,883 --> 00:17:05,554
Uh, two, three years of rent,
utilities, food...

223
00:17:05,804 --> 00:17:10,309
Okay, so I'm writing you
a check for...

224
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:17,357
So you fell asleep during my movie.
Big deal, right?

225
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:18,817
How do you clear this thing?

226
00:17:24,907 --> 00:17:26,950
Finish your enchilada.

227
00:17:27,117 --> 00:17:31,121
Ross, we've tried all the spicy food.
It's not working.

228
00:17:31,288 --> 00:17:34,625
Okay, here, have one of these peppers.

229
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:42,049
Oh, God. So hot. Oh, my God.

230
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:46,929
By the way, you don't want to touch
the pepper and then touch your eye.

231
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:53,268
- I am feeling nothing.
- Oh...

232
00:17:56,271 --> 00:17:59,399
Speaking of hot,
watching you do that...

233
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:01,610
...really makes me want
to have sex with you.

234
00:18:03,695 --> 00:18:07,241
- Stop it.
- Come on! Why are we wasting time?

235
00:18:07,407 --> 00:18:11,954
We know it's gonna work.
It's doctor-recommended.

236
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:18,001
I'm sorry. But we have to have
some boundaries. My God, I'm dying.

237
00:18:18,168 --> 00:18:21,171
We've done it before.
We'll do it again.

238
00:18:21,338 --> 00:18:24,091
It'll be a nice way
to bookend the pregnancy.

239
00:18:24,758 --> 00:18:28,262
I'm not gonna make love to you
so you'll go into labor.

240
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,931
Make love'? What are you, a girl?

241
00:18:33,725 --> 00:18:37,020
Always a great way to get
into a man's pants.

242
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:41,817
You'll be performing a service.
Think of me as a ketchup bottle.

243
00:18:41,984 --> 00:18:45,696
Sometimes, you have to bang on
the end of it to get it to come out.

244
00:18:48,699 --> 00:18:50,993
I love when you talk dirty to me.

245
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:56,248
Oh, I know it. You're right.
That's not sexy.

246
00:18:56,456 --> 00:18:59,543
Oh, oh. Whoops.

247
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,795
Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork.

248
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:05,882
Let me just bend over and get it.

249
00:19:13,348 --> 00:19:14,891
Oh, God!

250
00:19:17,894 --> 00:19:21,398
Okay, enough.
This is not going to happen.

251
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:24,234
Come on, Ross. I'm miserable here.

252
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:26,403
Come on, you started this,
now you finish it!

253
00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:31,783
Come on, wuss. Make love to me.

254
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:36,622
- You know what?
- What?

255
00:19:36,913 --> 00:19:38,915
Forget it.

256
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,128
What now, Ross, you're not gonna talk?

257
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:47,049
How on earth will you ever annoy me?

258
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:48,925
Oh, wait a minute, I know.

259
00:19:53,597 --> 00:19:57,809
I You'd think the jalapeño would
clear up your sinuses, but no!

260
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,646
That's not enough...
What are you doing?

261
00:20:00,812 --> 00:20:02,397
I'm getting that baby out of you!

262
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:12,324
- Oh, God!
- I know.

263
00:20:12,574 --> 00:20:14,701
Oh, no, no, no.

264
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:17,037
I think my water just broke.

265
00:20:18,914 --> 00:20:21,667
I am good!

266
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:27,130
Okay, I got the pillow. Uh, I got the bag.

267
00:20:27,297 --> 00:20:30,509
- You got the keys?
- I got the keys. Okay.

268
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:34,888
- Hey.
- Yeah?

269
00:20:35,222 --> 00:20:36,973
We're having a baby.

270
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:55,325
I didn't, uh, have time to read this part
of the books, but do we have time...?

271
00:20:55,534 --> 00:20:58,412
- Not so much.
- Okay, let's go.

272
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:04,668
- Two hundred.
- Thank you.

273
00:21:04,835 --> 00:21:08,797
That's it. I don't care when
the baby comes. No more betting.

274
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:10,215
Okay.

275
00:21:12,092 --> 00:21:13,760
Hello?

276
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:19,725
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay.

277
00:21:21,268 --> 00:21:23,395
I guess we could bet one more time.

278
00:21:24,813 --> 00:21:27,649
- Is Rachel having the baby?
- How did you know that?

279
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:32,779
- Joey! Chandler! It's time!
- They're at the coffee house.

280
00:21:32,988 --> 00:21:34,406
You know everything!

281
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:39,119
Wait. I bet you the baby
is over 7 pounds.

282
00:21:40,287 --> 00:21:44,040
I bet you it has hair!
I bet you it's a girl.

283
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:47,961
- We know it's a girl.
- I'll give you really good odds.
