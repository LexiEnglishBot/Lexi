1
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:06,338
I just saw Kathy naked.

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:08,382
It was like torture.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:13,012
If we go to war and you're captured,
you're in for a surprise.

4
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,514
It keeps getting worse.

5
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:19,018
I'm in love with
my roommate's girlfriend.

6
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:24,189
Every time we're in the same room,
there's weird energy between us.

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,151
Call me crazy, but
I think she likes me too.

8
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,612
And now I have seen her naked.

9
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,490
At least with her clothes on...

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,036
...I could imagine her body
was covered in boils.

11
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:41,749
But there are no boils.
She's smooth.

12
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,251
Smooth!

13
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,380
Wow...

14
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,340
Could you see up his robe?

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,885
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

16
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,728
- Here you go.
- I'll call you.

17
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:45,979
Great.

18
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,608
Hey, hey. Who was that?

19
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,111
Casey. We're going out tonight.

20
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,905
Going out? Wow.

21
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,410
It didn't work out with Kathy? Bummer.

22
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,954
No, things are fine.

23
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:06,625
I'm having a late meal with her
after an early one with Casey.

24
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,168
- What?
- Yeah.

25
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:12,297
The craziest thing is,
I just ate a whole pizza myself.

26
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:13,966
Wait...

27
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,468
- You're going out with Kathy.
- Yeah.

28
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,137
Why are you upset?

29
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,763
Well, I'm upset...

30
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,056
...for you.

31
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:26,687
Sex with an endless line of women
must be unfulfilling.

32
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:32,484
What's the big deal?
It's not like we're exclusive.

33
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,153
Look, Joey.

34
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,698
Kathy's not fulfilling
your emotional needs.

35
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,158
But Casey...

36
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,286
Granted, I just saw
the back of her head.

37
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:46,081
But I got this sense
that she's smart and funny...

38
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,542
...and gets you.

39
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,379
You got all that
from the back of her head?

40
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,631
It's time to settle down.

41
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,633
Make a choice. Pick a lane.

42
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,260
Who's Elaine?

43
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,683
Little Tony Tarzan

44
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:10,105
Swinging on a nose hair
Swinging with the greatest of ease

45
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,151
I don't know the next verse.

46
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,154
You could just go:

47
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,614
Greatest of ease

48
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,073
Ba-ma-na-ma-na-ma...

49
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,825
Then go right into it.

50
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,245
I like that.

51
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,165
How do you know about
"ba-ma-na-ma-na-ma"?

52
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,084
You know, I used to play.

53
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,338
That's right. The keyboards?

54
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,217
A little in high school.
I got into it in college.

55
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,720
That's when I really found my sound.

56
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,935
Juice just came out of my nose,
but it was worth it.

57
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,563
Oh, my God.

58
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,441
- I completely forgot about your sound.
- Yeah.

59
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,611
He'd lock himself in the basement.

60
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,698
No one was ever allowed to hear
"the sound."

61
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,243
I want to hear "the sound."

62
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:09,289
No, I mean, I haven't played in so long.

63
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,834
Well, it's really personal stuff.

64
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,295
Play that funky music, white boy.

65
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,258
- Yeah, come on.
- No, you guys.

66
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,386
My keyboards are all the way...
Yeah, okay.

67
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,519
Okay, guys.

68
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,438
All right. Bring it on, you.

69
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,360
Here we go.

70
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:49,288
You know, I've never played
my stuff for anyone before.

71
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,999
It's important that you understand...

72
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,584
...it's about communicating...

73
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,171
...very private emotions.

74
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,013
You know...

75
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:10,183
You should think of my work...

76
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,895
...as wordless sound poems.

77
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,236
- That's what...
- My God, play.

78
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,690
Well, you know, that was...

79
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,485
...terrific.

80
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,571
Really...

81
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,615
...bitchin'.

82
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:12,037
Wow. It was so wow.

83
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,497
Really?

84
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:18,585
Yeah. I mean, you should
play in public.

85
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,089
Wow, thanks, you guys. That's...

86
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,508
I want to play you another piece.

87
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,885
Oh.

88
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:31,431
I left my helicopter sounds
on another disk. I'll be back.

89
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:37,104
This is so nice. I mean, I am so...

90
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,611
God bless my dad
for soundproofing the basement.

91
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,075
I can't believe I ever let him
touch me with those fingers.

92
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,538
What are you guys talking about?
I loved it.

93
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,124
It was so moving.

94
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,836
It's so different
from the stuff you usually hear.

95
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,754
You mean, music?

96
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,469
I know what you think.

97
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,390
Yes, yes, your breasts
are just as firm and juicy.

98
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,018
Come in.

99
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,354
Hey.

100
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,731
Oh, God. Is that Baywatch?

101
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:25,277
Yes, but I just watch it
for the articles.

102
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,612
So is Joey around?

103
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,906
No, he's not back yet.

104
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,451
Come in, have a seat. Bow or stern?

105
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,786
I don't have a preference. You?

106
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,955
I like it in the stern.

107
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,251
Of the boat.

108
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,379
Hello.

109
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,341
It's me. Casey and I
had a little car trouble.

110
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,343
- What happened?
- We broke down.

111
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,637
I have to get transmission fluid.

112
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,600
Tell Kathy that I'm sorry
and I'll be there soon.

113
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:01,354
- Why can't you tell her?
- I think my time is about to...

114
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,148
Joey? Joey?

115
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,357
Yeah?

116
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,612
I thought your time ran out.

117
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,323
Me too, but I guess I do have...

118
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:17,996
Joey's running a little late,
and he says he's sorry.

119
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,499
I guess it's just you and me, then.

120
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,666
Oh.

121
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,503
- Okay.
- Yeah, I think it is.

122
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,175
So what'd you do today?

123
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,010
I had an appointment
to cut my hair.

124
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,096
- Looks great.
- And then it got canceled.

125
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,974
I could cut it.

126
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,559
Really?

127
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:44,564
Yeah, I learned at my aunt's
dog-grooming shop. What do you say?

128
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,566
Dog grooming?

129
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,110
Don't make my tail too poofy.

130
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,661
You have really great hair.

131
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,372
Oh, thanks. I grow it myself.

132
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,213
Joey also has great hair.

133
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,423
Yes, Joey has great hair.

134
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:15,095
I'm basically done here.
Let me get this hair off your neck.

135
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,235
What are you doing?

136
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,946
Checking if it's even.

137
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,031
Okay.

138
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,952
Looks good.

139
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,791
The phone! The phone's making sounds.

140
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,003
- Hello.
- Hey, dude, it's me.

141
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,212
Hey, it's Joey.

142
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,133
It looks like we'll be stuck here.

143
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,970
I got the fluid.
The transmission wasn't there.

144
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,389
- What?
- It fell out.

145
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,017
I just figured we hit a dog.

146
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,185
Okay.

147
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,689
Could you put Kathy on?
I want to apologize to her.

148
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,816
It's Joey.

149
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,526
Hey...

150
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,613
No, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

151
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,741
Yeah, no, stop apologizing. It's okay.

152
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,243
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

153
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,081
- I should probably go.
- Yeah.

154
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,167
Yes. Yeah...

155
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,890
I forgot my purse.

156
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,475
Oh...

157
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,567
I really did. I forgot my purse.

158
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,660
- This is bad. It's bad.
- Horrible.

159
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,871
Wait, the kiss or the situation?

160
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,956
The kiss was good.

161
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,876
- But that's bad.
- Here's what we do.

162
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,045
- We forget it.
- What?

163
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:17,300
We swallow our feelings, even if
we're unhappy forever. Sound good?

164
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,969
Can you really do that?

165
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,556
I have to. He's my best friend.

166
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,350
And you're seeing him.

167
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,561
Chandler, I like Joey a lot.

168
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,271
But with you...

169
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,565
No, don't. Don't, see?

170
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,652
You're getting me confused.
I'm starting to yearn.

171
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,448
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,911
If you want to pretend that
nothing happened, I can try.

173
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,331
I think we have to.

174
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,709
Okay.

175
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,754
- Bye.
- Bye.

176
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,350
Are you still out there?

177
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,728
No.

178
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,989
Electrifying

179
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,620
Infinite time

180
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,124
There's a Starbucks
about three blocks down.

181
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,378
He's so inspired.
Just look at him. Look at him go.

182
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,355
Thank you very much.

183
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,775
Hey, aren't you up next?

184
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,404
- I'm not playing tonight.
- Why not?

185
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,574
I can't follow Ross.

186
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,952
It'd be like those
poor bicycle-riding chimps...

187
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,206
...who had to follow the Beatles. No.

188
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,293
Phoebe. Ross sucks.

189
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,964
The place has emptied because of him.

190
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:24,093
My God, he's not even
appreciated in his own time.

191
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:28,473
I'd give anything to not be
appreciated in my own time.

192
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,353
Okay. Phoebe...

193
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,981
You suck too.

194
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,652
Yeah, Phoebe.

195
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,404
You're awful.

196
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,076
You guys.

197
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,995
You suck too.

198
00:13:56,418 --> 00:14:01,005
Man. I can't believe
I locked myself out again.

199
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,299
Hang on, buddy.

200
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,556
My God. What happened?

201
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,642
- Did you do all this? Why?
- I sure did.

202
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,521
It made me feel good to do
something nice for my friend.

203
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,106
You're amazing.

204
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,651
No, this is amazing.

205
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,030
A TV appears from nowhere.

206
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,908
The dream.

207
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,953
How did you afford all this?

208
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:35,206
I'm 29. I mean, who needs
a savings account?

209
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,167
You're the best friend
anyone has ever had.

210
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,045
I don't know.

211
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,463
No, you are.

212
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,091
You do this, you give me advice...

213
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:49,178
What you said about
focusing on one woman?

214
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,513
I'll do that.

215
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:51,931
With Casey?

216
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,518
I'll see how things go with Kathy.
She's cool.

217
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,146
- Or Casey.
- No, Kathy.

218
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,314
Could be Casey.

219
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,607
No, Kathy.

220
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:01,774
Consider Casey.

221
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,030
I think somebody's
got a little crush on Casey.

222
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,033
I'll fix you two up.
What do you think?

223
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:14,621
That all the pieces of my life
are falling right into place.

224
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,463
- Hey.
- Hey.

225
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,926
You were really great.
You were really, really great.

226
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,385
Thanks.

227
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:35,183
Monica tells me you don't want
to play anymore because of me...

228
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,560
...and, you know, my talent.

229
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:39,854
Is that true?

230
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,733
- Well, kind of, yeah.
- Pheebs...

231
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:47,779
I was trying to be really okay
and upbeat about it...

232
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:51,532
...but I just feel so dwarfed
by your musical gift.

233
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,702
See, but...

234
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:59,707
Pheebs, that is the exact
opposite intent of my music.

235
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,127
You know, my music
is meant to inspire.

236
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,296
If it bothers you this much...

237
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:09,133
...then I won't play anymore.

238
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,054
No, don't do that.

239
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:18,434
How could I live if I knew I was
depriving the world of your music?

240
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,897
Yeah, okay.

241
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:32,448
Hey, Chandler.
Saw the new furniture. Very nice.

242
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,826
Joey has the best boyfriend ever.

243
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,788
I kissed Kathy.

244
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,373
What? Are you serious?

245
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,458
- Does Joey know?
- No.

246
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,421
Is there any way you think
he will understand this?

247
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:50,717
You obviously haven't
screwed over your friends.

248
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,844
Which we all appreciate.

249
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:57,682
If you'd told him how you felt
before you kissed her...

250
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,435
...knowing Joey,
he'd have stepped aside.

251
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,647
Don't say that. That's not true, is it?

252
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,441
- Yeah.
- He loves you.

253
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,277
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?

254
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,904
I said something to Phoebe.

255
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,782
And I thought it was a really good idea.

256
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,994
- Yeah, I remember.
- Oh, my God.

257
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,371
What am I going to do?

258
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,290
You'll have to tell him.

259
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,042
Why do I have to?

260
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,003
- Because you do.
- Yeah, I know.

261
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,385
Would it be okay
if I wrote a song about this?

262
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,893
- Hey.
- Hey.

263
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,936
Sambuca Margarita?

264
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,147
It that a real thing?

265
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,567
Well, we only had sambuca, so it is now.

266
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,820
Listen, Joe. I need to...

267
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,572
I need to talk to you.

268
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,866
What's up?

269
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,744
It's about Kathy.

270
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,165
I like her.

271
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,793
I like her a lot, actually.

272
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,753
You do?

273
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:09,962
Yeah.

274
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,757
Your timing couldn't be better.

275
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,801
She's not my girlfriend anymore.

276
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,135
What?

277
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:20,848
- Yeah, she broke up with me.
- When?

278
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,267
Just now, after acting class.

279
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,271
I thought she was doing some scene,
so I let people watch.

280
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,735
Man, I am so sorry. Are you okay?

281
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:37,240
I've been better, but I'm all right.
So you like her?

282
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,034
Yes, but I don't have to.

283
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,954
No, it's okay.

284
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,832
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

285
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,418
You know why?
Because you came to me first.

286
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,049
I thought that would be
the best thing to do.

287
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,845
You might have your work
cut out for you.

288
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:03,933
When I talked to her, I got the feeling
she's into some other guy.

289
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,980
See, that's actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

290
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,984
I think I know who the other guy is.

291
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,443
Who?

292
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,613
It's me.

293
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,574
I'm the other guy.

294
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,534
What?

295
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:27,373
When you were late last night,
Kathy and I got to talking...

296
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,334
...and one thing led to another, and...

297
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,962
And what? Did you sleep with her?

298
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,797
No, I just kissed her.

299
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,091
What? That's even worse.

300
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,761
- How is that worse?
- It's the same.

301
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,349
There's nothing I could do.
I'm in love with her.

302
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,559
Who cares?

303
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,854
You went behind my back?
I'd never do that to you.

304
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:53,399
I have no excuses.
I was totally over the line.

305
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:58,446
You're so far past the line,
that you can't even see the line.

306
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,198
It's a dot to you.

307
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,908
Yes.

308
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:06,162
Yes, right. And I feel horrible.
You have to believe me.

309
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,831
Is that why you bought all this?

310
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,834
You know what?

311
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,503
I will not watch your TV.

312
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,589
I won't listen to your stereo.

313
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,093
And there's a loaf in the new bread maker
I won't eat. Know why?

314
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,261
Because...

315
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,014
It's all tainted with your betrayal.

316
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,479
This apartment is empty to me.
I'm not happy about you, either.

317
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,820
And just so you know...

318
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,657
...I made that bread for you.

319
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,049
Oh, my God. He's totally lost it.

320
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,261
What?

321
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,806
Phoebe. This cannot get any worse.

322
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:10,101
Rats in the basement
are hanging themselves.

323
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,779
Thank you. Thanks.

324
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,826
I lost it.

325
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,454
I won't play anymore.

326
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,708
Would you... Can you finish my set?

327
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,043
After that? Yeah.

328
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,548
No, I mean, if I can help.

329
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,556
Like I could lose it.

330
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,186
- What?
- I played bad on purpose, guys.

331
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,813
- Oh.
- Oh.

332
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,858
You were playing bad this whole time.

333
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,526
Just that last song.
