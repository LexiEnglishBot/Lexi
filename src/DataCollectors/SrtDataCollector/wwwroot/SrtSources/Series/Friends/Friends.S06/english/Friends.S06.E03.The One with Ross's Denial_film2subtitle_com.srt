00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:06,964
- Hey.
- Hey, check it out. This is unbelievable.

2
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,342
Joey has been holding his breath
for almost four minutes.

3
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,766
Are you trying to kill me?

4
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,395
- Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.
- Uh-huh, what?

5
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:26,233
Um, well, since I'm moving out
and you're so beautiful...

6
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,735
...how about I move in with you?

7
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:31,155
Well, that would be great,
but then what do we do about Denise?

8
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,408
- Who's Denise?
- My roommate.

9
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,786
- You have a roommate?
- Yes, Denise. Denise.

10
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,707
Hey, what is with the secrecy, Phoebe?
Huh?

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,126
And what about this Denise? She cute?

12
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,130
How can you have a roommate
that none of us know about?

13
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,591
Maybe because you never listen
to anything I say.

14
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,926
I talk about her all the time. Denise!

15
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:58,474
Rach, I was thinking, I'm gonna have
an extra room over at my place.

16
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,893
- Oh, that's true.
- Why don't you move in with me?

17
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,979
It'll be great.
We can stay up late talking, watch movies.

18
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,565
And you know
about naked Thursdays, right?

19
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,862
Yeah, yeah,
I think I'm gonna find my own place.

20
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,741
Hey, hey. I thought naked Thursdays
was just our thing, man.

21
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,701
- Hey.
- Hey.

22
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:03,038
What did Rachel say when you told her
you were still married to her?

23
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,291
Oh, that. Um, she took it really well.

24
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,586
- Oh. You didn't tell her, did you?
- No.

25
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:13,507
- Because you're in love with her.
- I am not in love with her.

26
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,843
She was very upset
about having to move out.

27
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,638
So I didn't tell her we were still married,
because she'd only get more upset.

28
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,015
I comforted her. As a friend.

29
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:25,435
- What do you mean, "comforted her"?
- It was nothing. I gave her a hug.

30
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,397
Aha. A classic sign of love, the hug.

31
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,191
It's also a sign of friendship.

32
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,277
Yeah, not in your case, Lovey Loverson.

33
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,113
It was a hug.

34
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,116
Just tell me this,
did you or did you not smell her hair?

35
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:43,620
Smell her hair? Well, what if I did?

36
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:47,541
Ninety percent of a woman's pheromones
come out the top of her head.

37
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,210
That's why women are shorter.

38
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:54,047
So that men will fall in love
when they hug them.

39
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,426
Come on, Ross, you're a scientist.

40
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,220
I was hugging her as a friend, okay?

41
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,639
It's not my fault her hair got in my face.

42
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:06,226
She's got a lot of it,
and it smells all, uh...

43
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,645
...you know, coconutty.

44
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,901
What? Oh. It doesn't mean
I have feelings for Rachel.

45
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,612
Maybe it means I have feelings
for coconuts.

46
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,783
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful.
Rachel's not in the same place you are.

47
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,786
Okay, if the place you're referring to
is being in love...

48
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:30,500
...then she is in the same place as me,
because I am not in that place.

49
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,836
Okay, I didn't understand that.

50
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:38,008
But maybe that's because you were
speaking the secret language of love.

51
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,639
- Hey.
CHANDLER: Hey.

52
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,141
- Dude, some guy just called for you.
- Who was it?

53
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,392
I don't know.

54
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,270
How about
"Thanks for taking the message"? Jeez.

55
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,148
Hey, listen.

56
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,567
When you move in,
Rachel's room's gonna be empty.

57
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,861
You wanna talk
about what we wanna do with it?

58
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,071
- Sure.
- Okay.

59
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,406
I think we should have
a beautiful guest room...

60
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:05,327
...with a mahogany sleigh bed
and bedside tables with flowers on them.

61
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,038
Then we could have a rolltop desk
with comment cards...

62
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,541
...so people can tell us
how much they love staying here.

63
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,420
Whatever, you know,
I really haven't thought about it that much.

64
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,882
Well, I like that idea, obviously. Ha, ha.

65
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,552
But I was thinking maybe
it could be a game room, you know?

66
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,554
I mean, you can buy old arcade games...

67
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,891
...like "Space Invaders"
and "Asteroids" for $200.

68
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,269
The real ones. The big, big, big ones.

69
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,730
No.

70
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,610
Okay, so you mean "no" as in,
"Gee, Chandler, what an interesting idea.

71
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,655
Let's discuss it
before we reject it completely."

72
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,991
Oh. I'm sorry. Of course.

73

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

74
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,745
Yes. Interesting idea,
um, talk about it, but no.

75
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,581
So that's it?

76
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:55,419
Well, I just don't think that arcade games
go in the beautiful guest room.

77
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,963
The guest room's gonna be filled
with antiques.

78
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,675
Which is why "Asteroids" is perfect.
It's the oldest game.

79
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,429
What do you have
against the guest room?

80
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,639
I don't have anything
against the guest room.

81
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,518
Especially since everybody that we know
lives about 30 seconds away.

82
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,062
Are you mocking me?

83
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,690
No, I'm not mocking you
or your beautiful guest room.

What's up?

85
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,199
Nothing. Monica and I had a stupid fight.

86
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,786

"Wanted: Female roommate,

- Nice.
- Ah?

89
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,505
I figured after living with you...

90
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,508
...it'd be an interesting change
to have a female roommate.

91
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:47,304
You know? Someone I could learn from.
Someone who's different than me.

92
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:51,141
And what's more different than me,
a guy who's not 19...

93
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,810
...than, say, a girl who is 19?

94
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,520

324
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,466
So, uh... Ahem.

325
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,552
Where are the other guys?

326
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,179
Well, let's see,
Monica and Chandler are occupied.

327
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,931
- Fighting?
- No, the other thing.

328
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,060
I really think it's great
they worked things out.

329
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,063
Yeah, there's no breaking them up,
is there?

330
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:13,067
Hey, can I borrow the key to your house
so I can make a copy?

331
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,736
- Here.
- Thank you.

332
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:16,946
Now, are you sure?

333
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,241
Because once I make a copy,
there's no turning back.

334
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,076
Yeah, I'm sure.

335
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,955
Now get out of here
before I change my mind.

336
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,086
Uh, listen, Ross.

337
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,173
You really think this moving in with Rachel
is a good idea?

338
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,800
I've been back and forth.

339
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,179
Yeah, well,
maybe you should go back, okay?

340
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,306
Rachel moves in,
and before you know it...

341
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,850
...you're where you don't wanna be,
back together.

342
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,518
Yeah, I don't think so.

343
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,354
She's already talking about,
you know, dating other guys.

344
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,856
That's not gonna work out.

345
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,401
Then she's gonna come home all weepy,
and you'll be telling her:

346
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,612
"Oh, that's okay. You'll find someone."

347
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,990
And then, bam, she finds you.

348
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,536
Huh. Oh, maybe you're right.

349
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,207
I am telling you, Ross, she is definitely
gonna fall in love with you again.

350
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,666
Now, is that what you want?

351
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,420
- Heh. Is that what I want?
- [OVER MICROPHONE] Yes.

352
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,884
Here she comes.
I'm gonna make your life much easier.

353
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,012
All right, well, the place was closed,
so I'll copy it later.

354
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,388
Or not.

355
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,141
Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in
with me?

356
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,684
- Ahh.
- Oh.

357
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:32,021
- Whoa, whoa, Joey.
- No, no, no. It's okay.

358
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:37,526
Look, Rach, I know I scared you off
with that whole naked-Thursdays thing...

359
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,947
...but we don't have to do that.

360
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:45,117
Well, it would be easier
to move just right across the hall.

361
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,830
Wait a minute, unless you're thinking
about naked Wednesdays.

362
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,584
Thursday's clearly not good for you.
Pick a day.

363
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,758
- Hi.
- Hi.

364
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,511
Come on in. Thanks for coming back.

365
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,305
Okay, there have been a lot of people
interested in the room.

366
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,308
But I have narrowed it down,
and you are one of the finalists.

367
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,978
- Great.
- Okay, now, before I make my decision...

368
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,356
...I just wanna make sure
that our personalities match, okay?

369
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,816
So I made up a little test.

370
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:21,070
Now, I'm gonna say a word, and then
you say the first thing that comes to mind.

371
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,948
- I can do that.
- Okay, here we go.

372
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,533
- Pillow.
- Fight.

373
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,535
Very good.

374
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,663
Okay. G.

375
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,999
- String?
- Excellent.

376
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,585
Okay. Um...

377
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,838
Doggy.

378
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,259
- Kitten?
- Ooh, sorry.

379
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,139
No, no, no. So close, though.
But, you know, okay, bye-bye.
