1
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:04,336
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,964
I saw the Porsche parked out front.

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,509
Can I get the keys?
I'll take that bad boy for a spin.

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:15,723
Ross drives it? When I ask,
you say you're the only one allowed to.

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,393
He's my brother, plus he drives
so slow he couldn't hurt it.

6
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,229
It's a car, Monica, not a rocket ship.

7
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:23,814
Whatever, Ross.

8
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,942
Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights
after you're done.

9
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,195
- Hey.
- Hi.

10
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:34,825
Saw the Porsche. Looking good.
When can I take it out again?

11
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:42,541
- You let Joey drive it?
- I've never driven it. Not once.

12
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,794
Okay, once. Okay, I drive it all the time.

13
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:52,301
So much for the "you can drive it
but don't tell Rachel" plan.

14
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,512
Wow, I can't believe you lied to me.

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,642
I can fix this. Monica, Rachel thinks
all you can talk about is the wedding.

16
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:07,483
I won't let you drive the Porsche
because you're a terrible driver.

17
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,319
There. That wasn't about the wedding.

18
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:16,825
If you want a ride in the Porsche,
I'll take you around the block.

19
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,494
You got a couple hours?

20
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,702
Whew, that was a brisk ride.

21
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,791
- Take the top down, did you?
- Only way to fly.

22
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:12,214
Give me the keys. Monica's wrong.
I'm an excellent driver.

23
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:16,468
You're fast and irresponsible.
That adds up to a bad driver.

24
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:20,222
In high school, that added up
to head cheerleader.

25
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,813
Did you see the look
that girl just gave me, huh?

26
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,774
She must've seen me cruising
in the bad boy.

27
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:34,153
- She's checking out your beehive.
- What?

28
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,406
- Give me a brush.
- Give me the keys.

29
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,158
- No way!
- Well, no brush.

30
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,201
Fine. It doesn't matter.

31
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:45,455
If I remember correctly, there's a comb
on the floor of the bathroom.

32
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,473
Alimony.

33
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,981
We still haven't gotten an RSVP
from your dad.

34
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,777
Oh, right. Um, maybe that's because
I didn't send him an invitation.

35
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,032
Chandler, he's your father.
He should be at your wedding.

36
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,203
I don't even know him.
I haven't seen him in years.

37
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,914
And when he finds out he wasn't asked?

38
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,374
We don't run in the same circles.

39
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,669
I hang out with you guys and he...

40
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,547
...stars in a drag show in Vegas.

41
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,342
Ooh, I think I want to trade circles.

42
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,179
You don't want him there.
Nobody will stare at the bride...

43
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,724
...when the groom's father's
wearing a backless dress.

44
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,059
Heh, so what?

45
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,646
As long as he's not wearing
a white dress and a veil, I don't care.

46
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,273
I think I need to do some shopping.

47
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,905
Ah.

48
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,866
Ooh, nice.

49
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,536
My God!

50
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:11,959
- What do you think you're doing?
- Just washing the windshield.

51
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,841
There's no way I'll let you drive this car.

52
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,844
- Just hand over the keys.
- Oh.

53
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,096
Oh, ah-ah-ah!

54
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,640
Do not start this car.

55
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,688
Okay, okay. I will give you 20 bucks...

56
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,358
...if you get out of this car right now. Hey!

57
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,653
Look.

58
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,406
If you're so freaked out, get in the car.

59
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,283
With you? Yeah, right.

60
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,701
All right.

61
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,953
Okay, okay, okay.

62
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,669
- What are you doing? Get in front.
- In the death seat?

63
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,136
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, sweetie.

64
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,639
- Ready to go?
- My purse is at Mon's. I'll be back.

65
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,099
- Wait a minute.
- What?

66
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,726
Oh.

67
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:12,894
Ooh!

68
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,814
Oops.

69
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,108
Whoa, oh, that one kept going.

70
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,073
So, you and Phoebe, huh?

71
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,242
- How long have you been going out?
- A month.

72
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,829
Wow. We ought to get to
know each other better.

73
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,583
- Sure. I'd like that.
- Yeah. So, uh...

74
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,210
What's your name?

75
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,840
- It's Jake.
- Joey.

76
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,551
- Do you like the Knicks?
- Yeah, big fan.

77
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,388
Me too. There's a game Tuesday.
Do you want to go?

78
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:52,309
Great! Let me make sure
I'm not doing anything Tuesday.

79
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,027
Here.

80
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,739
- What's this?
- Your suitcase. We're going to Vegas.

81
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,992
Are you serious? Eloping?
No more stupid wedding stuff.

82
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,580
No more these flowers, these flowers.
Think of the money we'll save.

83
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,626
We're not eloping. I love the flowers.
Can our wedding be bigger, please?

84
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,587
We're going to see your dad.

85
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,298
I want to get to know my father-in-law.

86
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,509
We already went over this and I won.

87
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:28,637
No, you didn't. Honey, just so you know...

88
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,640
Now that you're marrying me,
you don't get to win anymore.

89
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,978
Forget it. I don't want to go.
I don't want to see him.

90
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,856
I know your dad embarrassed you.

91
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,567
All kids are embarrassed
by their parents.

92
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,071
You need a new word
for what I went through.

93
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,199
In high school,
he came to all my swim meets...

94
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,577
...dressed as a Hollywood starlet.

95
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,121
It's hard enough to be 14.

96
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:58,417
You're skinny, wearing Speedos
your mom promised you'd grow into.

97
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,047
You look up in the stands.
There's your dad cheering you on.

98
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:08,135
Dressed as Carmen Miranda,
wearing a headdress with real fruit...

99
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:12,848
...that he'll later give to your friends
as a healthy snack.

100
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,270
The point is that he was at every one
of your swim meets cheering you on.

101
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,397
That's a pretty great dad.

102
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,524
He had sex with Mr. Garibaldi.

103
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,986
- Who's Mr. Garibaldi?
- Does it matter?

104
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,072
Chandler...

105
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,077
You're not 14 anymore, okay?
Maybe it's time you let that stuff go.

106
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:40,542
If he's not at your wedding,
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

107
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,714
Okay, but I'm just doing this for you.

108
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,299
Yes!

109
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:52,262
- I never get to win anymore?
- How much did you ever win before?

110
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,976
- Pheebs.
- Hey.

111
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,938
You know how, uh, when you're wearing pants
and you lean forward...

112
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,565
...I check out your underwear?

113
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,233
Yeah.

114
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,111
- Well, when Jake did it...
- Mm-hm.

115
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,823
...I saw that he was wearing
women's underwear.

116
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,742
I know. They were mine.

117
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,660
Oh.

118
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,664
No, no, wait. That's weird.

119
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,668
We were goofing around,
and I dared him to try them on.

120
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,253
That's weird!

121
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:29,257
- I'm wearing his briefs right now.
- That's kind of hot.

122
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:35,472
I think so too. And that little flap?
Great for holding my lipstick.

123
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,395
I wouldn't know about that.

124
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:48,109
Jake says that women's underwear
is actually more comfortable.

125
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,279
He loves how silk feels against his skin.

126
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:55,700
Next he'll say your high heels
are good for his posture.

127
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,412
There's nothing wrong with Jake.
He is all man.

128
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,331
I think, more than you.

129
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:05,377
He looked like a real lumberjack
in those pink lacies.

130
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:10,674
Only a man completely secure
with his masculinity...

131
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:14,135
...could walk around in women's underwear.
I don't think you could.

132
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:18,348
- I am secure with my masculinity.
- Okay, whatever.

133
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,101
You've seen my huge stack of porn.

134
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,235
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?

135
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,490
God, I forgot how much I love driving.

136
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,368
I have got to get my license renewed.

137
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,375
You don't have a valid driver's license?
Pull over right now.

138
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,628
You're so tense. You just gotta relax, okay?

139
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:53,925
Okay? Just need to relax. All right?
Just need to relax.

140
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,971
What are you...? That's not funny.
Stop horsing around.

141
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,390
I am not horsing around, okay?

142
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,852
I am "Porsche-ing" around.

143
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,775
Uh-oh.

144
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:16,072
Stay calm. Nothing will happen.
You're not in that much trouble.

145
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,657
Really? You think so?

146
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,619
I'm talking to myself. You're going down!

147
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:04,245
I can feel something inside me say

148
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,164
Has someone taken your order?

149
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:11,878
Oh, yeah. She did. Um, he did. She?
I'm sorry, I'm new. I don't...

150
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:13,963
Mm-hm.

151
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:17,342
- I just ordered a beer.
- You're straight. I get it.

152
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,389
If we called your dad,
we'd have better seats.

153
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,434
I don't want him to know
we're here yet. I'm not ready.

154
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,437
He won't be too happy to see me either.

155
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,980
Why not?

156
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:35,610
I don't know if I told you this,
but he's kind of tried to contact me...

157
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,822
...a lot over the last few years.
- What?

158
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:42,117
Yeah. He's made phone calls,
written letters.

159
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:45,912
He even came to New York.
I said I was too busy.

160
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,748
It's very "Cat's in the Cradle."
I don't want to get into it.

161
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,628
Here we go.

162
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,714
Ladies and gentlemen...

163
00:11:55,881 --> 00:12:00,218
...please welcome the incomparable
Helena Handbasket.

164
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,724
Hello, darlings.

165
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,184
And there's Daddy.

166
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:18,319
Okay. Switch places with me. Come on!
I'll go under, you go over.

167
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,322
- Yeah, I'll get right on that.
- Ugh, come on!

168
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,074
What? No. Hey, Rach, come on.

169
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,870
I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.

170
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,290
God!

171
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:37,464
Hi, officer. Was I going a little too fast?

172
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,257
Oh, my God.

173
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,136
- Can I see your license, please?
- Oh, yes, absolutely.

174
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:47,849
It's weird. I had a dream last night
that I was stopped by a policeman.

175
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,268
And then he, um...

176
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,147
Well, I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.

177
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:59,778
- Your license.
- Yes. Ahem. Here you go, Officer, uh...

178
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,446
...Handsome.

179
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,408
- It's Hanson.
- Oops, sorry. My mistake.

180
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,577
Dear Lord!

181
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,039
- Wow!
- Here it comes.

182
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,874
This is a great picture.

183
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,375
Ah!

184
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:18,087
Really? You think so?
You know, I had just rolled right out of bed.

185
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,923
You look phenomenal.

186
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,009
She should! It was taken 10 years ago!

187
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,473
You know, you're probably, um...

188
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,642
Probably wondering about the old date.

189
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,020
Yes, I am. You're an Aquarius, huh?

190
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,066
- I'll bet you're a Gemini.
- No.

191
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,567
- Taurus?
- No.

192
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,569
- Virgo?
- No.

193
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,780
- Sagittarius?
- Yep.

194
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,407
I knew it. I knew it!

195
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,577
- You won't speed anymore, right?
- I won't speed.

196
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,539
- Promise to take care of this?
- I promise.

197
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,666
Let him drive. Does he have a license?

198
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,252
- Yeah.
- Can he handle a stick?

199
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,922
- Oh, well...
- I can handle a stick!

200
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,469
I feel pretty

201
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,304
Oh, so pretty

202
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,015
I feel pretty and witty and

203
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,517
Gay

204
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:20,233
- That can't be your father.
- I've been saying that for years.

205
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,527
- Oh, my God!
- What?

206
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,238
That's Mr. Garibaldi playing the piano.

207
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,117
For I'm loved

208
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:34,247
By a pretty wonderful boy

209
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,963
Hello, and welcome to the show.

210
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:46,009
I see some of our regulars in the audience.

211
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,512
And a couple of irregulars.

212
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:55,268
- He's coming into the audience.
- Relax. You'll be fine.

213
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,022
Oh, much better. You're invisible now.

214
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,483
- Where are you from?
- Bakersfield.

215
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,694
- I'm sorry?
- Bakersfield.

216
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,906
No, no, I heard. I'm just sorry.

217
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,618
I'll meet you back at the hotel.

218
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:17,373
Look, a standing ovation already.
So early in the show.

219
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,544
Turn around, darling.
Let me see your pretty face.

220
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,932
Can we have our drinks, please?
Uh, waiter? ...tress?

221
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,654
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

222
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,449
Check it out.

223
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,826
Huh?

224
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,998
How much of a man am I?

225
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:03,836
Wow, nice. Manly, and also kind of a slut.

226
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,174
You know, I'm beginning to see
what Jake was talking about.

227
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,843
- Uh-huh.
- The silk feels really good.

228
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:16,474
And things aren't as smashed down
as I thought they would be.

229
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,850
That's great.

230
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,770
You have so many more choices
than with men's underwear.

231
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:26,359
Bikini, French cut, thong.
And the fabrics: Cotton, silk, lace.

232
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:30,196
You know what I've always
wondered about? Pantyhose!

233
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:34,534
The way they start at your toe,
then they go all the way up to...

234
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,957
- I should go take these off.
- I think it's important you do.

235
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,333
Mm.

236
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,461
What's your name?

237
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,507
Chandler.

238
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,051
Chandler?

239
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,512
What an unusual name.

240
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,057
You must have had terribly
fascinating parents.

241
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,184
Oh, they're a hoot.

242
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,063
And who is your friend?

243
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,108
I'm Monica.

244
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,945
- Monica. Where are you from?
- New York.

245
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,032
I'm not very fond of New York.

246
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,784
Queens, I like.

247
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,371
Ooh, what is this...

248
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,292
...sparkling something, honey, huh?

249
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,755
Actually, Monica and I are engaged.

250
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,716
Really?

251
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,135
Congratulations.

252
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,679
When's the big day?

253
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,433
In two weeks.

254
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,061
I see.

255
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:49,192
Well, I wish you both
a lifetime of happiness.

256
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,320
So you're bald.

257
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,155
Wait, wait.

258
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,285
We'd really love it if you could be there.

259
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,039
Really?

260
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,126
I know it would make me happy...

261
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,837
...ma'am.

262
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,009
Then I wouldn't miss it for the world.

263
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,013
Oh, I'm getting all misty here. Ha!

264
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:22,225
You'd think I was having my legs waxed
or something.

265
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,690
- You okay?
- Yeah.

266
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,151
Thanks for making me do this.

267
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,240
Before we go on with the show,
I want to say to the bride and groom...

268
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,326
...how lucky they are to have
found each other.

269
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,080
In every life a little rain must fall.

270
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,623
Fortunately...

271
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,792
...in my life...

272
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,422
It's raining men

273
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,258
Hallelujah

274
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,845
- It's raining men, uh-huh
- Amen

275
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,018
When I was growing up,
I played the one on the far left.

276
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,774
And it's raining men, amen

277
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,448
Remind me to introduce you to someone.

278
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,159
- Who?
- Fourth gear.

279
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,038
What?

280
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,457
What does he want?
I wasn't doing anything.

281
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:33,337
Maybe he saw your hands slip briefly
from the 10 and 2:00 position.

282
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:40,052
Maybe it's, uh, Sergeant Sagittarius
coming back to flirt some more.

283
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,265
It's a different guy.

284
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:51,105
- Good evening, officer.
- Do you know how fast you were going?

285
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:55,109
Uh, no, I don't, but it could not
have been more than 60.

286
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,069
You're right. It was 37.

287
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,286
You're not ticketing me
for driving too slow, are you?

288
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,205
That's right.

289
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,632
You know, officer, I, uh...

290
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,552
I had the weirdest dream last night.

291
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,971
Oh, my God!

292
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,015
Your license, please.

293
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:31,020
You don't want to hear about my dream...

294
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,772
...Officer...

295
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,357
...Pretty?

296
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,528
It's Petty.

297
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,574
I'll be right back with your ticket.

298
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,205
- You have a son.
- I know. I know.

299
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,422
- Feel better?
- Yeah. Much. Heh.

300
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,258
Listen, uh...

301
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:05,763
Not that I'm insecure about
my manhood or anything, but, uh...

302
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,683
...I need to hook up with
a woman right now.

303
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:12,019
- I understand.
- Yeah, okay.

304
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,651
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

305
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,404
You look familiar. Do I know you?

306
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:22,905
I don't think so.

307
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,491
Maybe it's because I'm on television.

308
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:31,497
- I'm an actor on Days of our Lives.
- Wow. Really?

309
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,500
- Four-fifty, please.
- Oh, let me get this.

310
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,721
These are for you.
