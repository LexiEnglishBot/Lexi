1
00:00:03,222 --> 00:00:04,847
Hey, guys.

2
00:00:05,623 --> 00:00:08,813
So, what do you think?

3
00:00:10,146 --> 00:00:11,285
- About what?
- What?

4
00:00:12,442 --> 00:00:15,917
Are you kidding?
Okay, I'll give you a hint.

5
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:21,621
Eyes. No, no. Your eyes! No.

6
00:00:21,836 --> 00:00:23,532
Chandler's eyes!

7
00:00:24,827 --> 00:00:26,452
I got glasses.

8
00:00:26,742 --> 00:00:29,102
You always had glasses.

9
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:33,489
No, I didn't.

10
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:36,306
Are you sure?

11
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:39,297
Didn't you have a pair?

12
00:00:39,545 --> 00:00:43,744
They were really round and burgundy,
and they made you look kind of...

13
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:45,942
- Feminine.
- Yes!

14
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:47,335
No.

15
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:50,357
I think the glasses look great.
You look sexy.

16
00:00:50,678 --> 00:00:52,031
- Really?
- Yeah.

17
00:00:52,313 --> 00:00:54,365
You didn't think I wore glasses?

18
00:00:54,645 --> 00:00:56,174
Of course.

19
00:01:00,106 --> 00:01:04,377
The One With Phoebe's Cookies

20
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,909
What do you want for
an engagement gift?

21
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:55,180
That's okay, we're not
having a party...

22
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:57,369
...so you don't have to get us...

23
00:01:58,348 --> 00:02:02,346
If someone wants to give us a present,
we can't deprive them of that joy.

24
00:02:03,428 --> 00:02:05,860
You should get them a
little CD player.

25
00:02:06,177 --> 00:02:07,315
I already have one.

26
00:02:07,637 --> 00:02:10,828
Unless someone borrowed it and
left it at the gynecologist.

27
00:02:14,074 --> 00:02:17,478
Yeah, and by "someone"
she means Joey.

28
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,226
I know what I want!

29
00:02:20,511 --> 00:02:23,251
- What we want, honey.
- No, you don't want this.

30
00:02:24,303 --> 00:02:26,900
I want your grandmother's
cookie recipe.

31
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,479
You mean the chocolate chip
cookie recipe?

32
00:02:30,808 --> 00:02:33,062
The one my grandma
made me swear on her deathbed...

33
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:35,980
...that I would never
let out of our family?

34
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:39,817
Dying people say the craziest things.

35
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,754
I've wanted it for years. I was gonna
make cookies for my children.

36
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:48,375
Break my heart. Oh, all right.

37
00:02:48,726 --> 00:02:52,202
I'll be the mom who makes the
world's best chocolate chip cookies.

38
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:55,710
Our kids are gonna be fat,
aren't they?

39
00:02:57,703 --> 00:02:59,197
Ahoy!

40
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:02,075
- How's the boat?
- I'm getting into this sailing stuff.

41
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:04,203
You finally took it out of the marina?

42
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:06,258
Why would I do that?

43
00:03:06,991 --> 00:03:09,838
It took three guys
to get the thing in there.

44
00:03:10,715 --> 00:03:12,732
If you don't sail it,
what do you do on it?

45
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:14,743
It's a great place to just sit...

46
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:18,433
...hang around, drink a few beers,
eat some chips.

47
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:23,265
It's good that you finally
have a place to do that.

48
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,327
I could teach you to sail if you want.

49
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,833
- You could?
- I've been sailing my whole life.

50
00:03:29,154 --> 00:03:32,144
When I was 15, my dad
bought me my own boat.

51
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:35,788
- Your own boat?
- He was trying to cheer me up.

52
00:03:36,043 --> 00:03:37,668
My pony was sick.

53
00:03:49,298 --> 00:03:51,374
- You know what I was thinking?
- What?

54
00:03:51,908 --> 00:03:53,960
Nothing, I just like to go like this.

55
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:58,270
- What are you doing tonight?
- Do you have a lecture?

56
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:01,639
- No, why?
- Then, free as a bird. What's up?

57
00:04:01,997 --> 00:04:04,702
My dad wants to know if you want
to play racquetball.

58
00:04:04,955 --> 00:04:06,687
Great! Dad must like you!

59
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:08,562
He doesn't ask just anyone to play.

60
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:11,069
He didn't ask for you.
He asked for "Chauncey."

61
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:13,575
I assumed he meant you.

62
00:04:14,244 --> 00:04:15,667
Did you correct him?

63
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:18,416
No, I thought it would be
more fun this way.

64
00:04:19,985 --> 00:04:22,346
Cool! Maybe you could
do this every week.

65
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,839
Or you could sit on the porch...

66
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,201
...and make sure no one
steals the trashcans.

67
00:04:26,873 --> 00:04:28,949
He does that every week too.

68
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:34,101
Just so you know, you have to let
him win. He hates to lose.

69
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:36,749
Maybe I'll play with my left hand.

70
00:04:37,938 --> 00:04:39,290
You're not a lefty?

71
00:04:40,756 --> 00:04:42,416
Does anybody know me?

72
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:48,442
What's wrong?

73
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:52,091
I went to my old apartment
to get the cookie recipe...

74
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,808
...and that stupid fire burned it up!

75
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,874
No! Why didn't you make a copy
and keep it in a fireproof box...

76
00:04:59,161 --> 00:05:02,115
...and keep it at least 100 yards
away from the original?

77
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:10,389
Because I'm normal.

78
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:14,781
That was the one legacy
my grandmother left me.

79
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,800
And I know you wanted it
as an engagement present.

80
00:05:18,053 --> 00:05:20,164
We have to get you
an engagement present?

81
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:22,393
Don't worry about it.

82
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:25,147
No one got me an engagement present.

83
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:29,320
I don't have the recipe, but here.

84
00:05:29,638 --> 00:05:31,999
I wish you health
and happiness.

85
00:05:33,012 --> 00:05:34,672
An old cookie?

86
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:38,506
This is what happens when you
don't register for gifts.

87
00:05:39,832 --> 00:05:44,482
I made a batch and froze it.
This is the only one left.

88
00:05:44,738 --> 00:05:45,947
We can't accept this.

89
00:05:46,198 --> 00:05:47,135
Why not?

90
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:50,198
Because it's gross.

91
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,156
No, wait. I think I can figure out
the recipe from this cookie.

92
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,070
I do this at work all the time.

93
00:05:56,393 --> 00:05:57,461
- Really?
- I think so!

94
00:06:02,551 --> 00:06:04,319
Okay, Ross, we owe you a present.

95
00:06:04,603 --> 00:06:06,892
Two! I've been engaged twice.

96
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:17,326
Look at this clown.

97
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:20,841
He thinks he can take up the
whole river.

98
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:23,762
Get out of the way, jackass!

99
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,215
Who names their boat
Coast Guard, anyway?

100
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:32,635
That is the Coast Guard.

101
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:33,933
What are they doing here?

102
00:06:34,246 --> 00:06:36,322
The coast is all the way over there.

103
00:06:37,308 --> 00:06:38,731
Joey, just ignore the boats.

104
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:41,160
- We're not finished with our lesson.
- All right.

105
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:43,595
I'm gonna go over the basic
points once more.

106
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:45,793
Come on, Rach. I got it, okay?

107
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,735
I want to go over there...

108
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:50,243
...where that boatload of girls is.

109
00:06:52,303 --> 00:06:54,284
Is that it? You want to give...

110
00:06:54,565 --> 00:06:56,546
...a shout out to the hot chicas?

111
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,772
Okay, let's do that, Sailor Joe.

112
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:02,148
Quick question, though:
What's this called?

113
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,636
- Boat rope?
- Wrong!

114
00:07:06,881 --> 00:07:08,684
How do you get the mainsail up?

115
00:07:09,768 --> 00:07:11,642
Rub it?

116
00:07:14,813 --> 00:07:18,217
No. What do you do if I say
we're coming about?

117
00:07:18,535 --> 00:07:21,347
I say, "Come again?"

118
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:23,573
I know this one. I know this one.

119
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,608
Time's up. Now you're dead.

120
00:07:27,895 --> 00:07:29,069
And deaf!

121
00:07:29,321 --> 00:07:31,230
You go on and make your little jokes.

122
00:07:31,513 --> 00:07:33,007
If you don't know
what you're doing...

123
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:36,514
...you will die.
Am I getting through to you?

124
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,573
- Yes.
- Don't just say yes.

125
00:07:39,863 --> 00:07:42,295
This isn't a game.
You could get hurt out here!

126
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:45,387
Do you want to pay attention,
or do you want to die?

127
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,403
I want to make a
ship-to-shore call to Chandler.

128
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:03,688
- I definitely taste nutmeg.
- You do?

129
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:06,371
You don't? Well, that's
the difference...

130
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,766
...between a
professional and a layman.

131
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,105
That and arrogance.

132
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:15,313
Hey.

133
00:08:15,664 --> 00:08:17,088
Hey. How was sailing?

134
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:19,800
I don't want to talk about it.

135
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:22,787
You could've at least saved
me a cookie.

136
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:28,744
Women are mean!

137
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:34,721
I can't believe that.

138
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,307
Now the only thing left
of my grandmother's legacy is...

139
00:08:38,557 --> 00:08:40,087
...this crumb.

140
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:44,882
I wish you a long and happy marriage.

141
00:08:48,055 --> 00:08:49,823
- Hey.
- How was it?

142
00:08:50,073 --> 00:08:52,611
Well, I had a great time.

143
00:08:52,926 --> 00:08:55,179
Chauncey, on the other hand...

144
00:08:55,431 --> 00:08:57,376
I will tell the story.

145
00:08:57,727 --> 00:09:00,681
It was going great.
I let him win, we were bonding...

146
00:09:00,997 --> 00:09:02,765
...he even said I could call him Dad.

147
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,782
And what did he ask you
not to call him?

148
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:07,180
Daddy.

149
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:10,317
Look, here's the story.

150
00:09:11,226 --> 00:09:15,710
We had just finished playing,
and we were gonna take a steam.

151
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:17,036
I walk into the room...

152
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:19,296
...and it's really steamy.

153
00:09:21,942 --> 00:09:25,062
So I take off my glasses,
and that's when it happened.

154
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:26,326
Guys?

155
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,449
- Over here.
- Have a seat, son.

156
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:35,647
Hey!

157
00:09:43,026 --> 00:09:45,908
- Oh, my God! I can't believe it.
- I know.

158
00:09:46,192 --> 00:09:48,624
You gave my father a lap dance.

159
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:54,608
Why do they put
so much steam in there?

160
00:09:56,247 --> 00:10:00,933
Because otherwise they'd
have to call it the "room" room.

161
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:06,472
Why?
Why did that have to happen?

162
00:10:07,346 --> 00:10:08,875
Come on, it's not that big a deal.

163
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:11,445
Not that big a deal?

164
00:10:11,764 --> 00:10:14,089
There was touching of things.

165
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:16,450
I know you wanted
to bond with my dad...

166
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,859
...but did you have to bond
to that part?

167
00:10:23,211 --> 00:10:24,871
I'm sure Dad doesn't care.

168
00:10:25,194 --> 00:10:26,653
He probably thought it was funny.

169
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:28,663
He'll be telling this story for years.

170
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:31,691
I don't want him to tell
this story for years.

171
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,265
Oh, but he will.

172
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:39,177
He still tells the story about how
Monica tried to escape from fat camp.

173
00:10:41,093 --> 00:10:42,124
I wasn't escaping.

174
00:10:42,381 --> 00:10:44,563
Then how'd you get caught
in the barbed wire?

175
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,450
I was trying to help out a squirrel.

176
00:10:47,704 --> 00:10:49,471
You were trying to eat it.

177
00:10:52,923 --> 00:10:55,627
If that is your father calling
to tell this story...

178
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,612
...then the marriage is off!

179
00:10:58,176 --> 00:11:00,157
Come on. Hello.

180
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,320
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.

181
00:11:03,603 --> 00:11:05,441
I'll call you later, Dad.
I love you.

182
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:13,690
I'm off to see your dad.

183
00:11:14,563 --> 00:11:15,951
Aren't you a little overdressed?

184
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:21,378
You better make sure
he tips you this time.

185
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,792
I figured I would try to convince
him not to tell the story anymore...

186
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,890
...and I figured the best way
to do that was face to face.

187
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,641
And by "face," I don't mean his lap.

188
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,770
And by "face," I don't mean my ass.

189
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:40,404
Are you getting Monica and
Chandler a present?

190
00:11:40,657 --> 00:11:42,982
I don't know. You know,
they didn't get us anything.

191
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,820
Thank you!

192
00:11:46,885 --> 00:11:47,916
Hey.

193
00:11:48,484 --> 00:11:49,658
Well, hello.

194
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:52,722
So when are we getting
back out on the water, matey?

195
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:57,138
I don't know the boat way
to say this, but never!

196
00:11:59,131 --> 00:12:00,103
Why not?

197
00:12:00,384 --> 00:12:02,709
Because you're mean on the boat.

198
00:12:03,411 --> 00:12:05,143
I was just trying to teach you.

199
00:12:05,463 --> 00:12:07,823
Well, lesson learned.
Rachel is mean.

200
00:12:08,838 --> 00:12:11,958
Yep, yep, yep.

201
00:12:13,117 --> 00:12:15,193
I remember when she took me out
on her dad's boat.

202
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:17,321
She wouldn't let me help at all.

203
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,481
Excuse me, I wanted you to help.

204
00:12:19,762 --> 00:12:20,901
But you couldn't move...

205
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:24,105
...because you were wearing
three life jackets.

206
00:12:25,398 --> 00:12:28,139
You have to respect the sea.

207
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:32,380
Joey, I'm sorry if you thought
that was mean.

208
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,651
But I tell you, that was not mean.

209
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:38,821
My father is mean. He used to always
yell at me on the boat.

210
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:42,132
It was horrible.
I was being a really good teacher.

211
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:45,259
Does a good teacher say,
"Put down the beer, pinhead!"

212
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,505
Does a good student drink seven beers
during his first lesson?

213
00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:51,274
Six and a half.

214
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:53,785
You knocked the last
one out of my hand, remember?

215
00:12:54,032 --> 00:12:55,906
I didn't want you to get hit
by the boom.

216
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:57,471
Well, it hit me anyway.

217
00:12:57,755 --> 00:13:00,874
It would have hurt a lot less
if I had finished that last beer.

218
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,971
I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down
and stop yelling.

219
00:13:07,741 --> 00:13:09,056
No bossing me around?

220
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:11,072
- I won't boss you around.
- And be nice?

221
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,948
- I'll be nice.
- You'll be topless?

222
00:13:14,107 --> 00:13:16,539
- Joey!
- You want me to learn?

223
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:26,034
Here's batch 22.
Maybe these are like your grandma's.

224
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,131
This has a bit of orange peel,
but no nutmeg.

225
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:31,004
Let's give it a shot.

226
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:33,971
I haven't made so many cookies
since 9th grade.

227
00:13:34,217 --> 00:13:35,771
What for, a bake sale?

228
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:37,864
No, just a Friday night.

229
00:13:43,611 --> 00:13:44,820
These are pretty good.

230
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:46,980
Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.

231
00:13:47,229 --> 00:13:48,237
Which one was that?

232
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:50,568
The ones we had after
you almost threw up.

233
00:13:51,682 --> 00:13:53,758
Oh, yeah, batch 17 was good.

234
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:57,144
I did not like batch 16.

235
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,229
I'm okay.

236
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:04,685
Any more from the good batch?
We could work off those.

237
00:14:04,938 --> 00:14:08,343
I think there's one left.

238
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,276
Batch 16.
Sixteen, people, get out of the way!

239
00:14:23,726 --> 00:14:27,510
Okay, Joey. You're doing really good.

240
00:14:27,796 --> 00:14:29,942
I just need you
to step to the portside.

241
00:14:35,311 --> 00:14:37,778
Remember talking about the portside?

242
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,554
Oh, yeah.

243
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:40,902
No.

244
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:46,295
It's left, sweetie, but that's okay.
That's a tough one.

245
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,899
Why not just say left?

246
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:49,844
Okay, go to the left.

247
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:56,251
The left.

248
00:14:56,499 --> 00:14:57,436
Just sit over there!

249
00:14:57,752 --> 00:14:59,863
You're yelling again. See that?

250
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:04,044
Oh, no, no. Very quiet.
Said with love, no yelling.

251
00:15:06,554 --> 00:15:11,205
You know what? Since I'm here,
I'm gonna have a beer on the portside.

252
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:14,198
See what I did there?

253
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,952
We're luffing a little.
Can you tighten up the Cunningham?

254
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:25,225
You just said a bunch
of stuff I don't know.

255
00:15:25,516 --> 00:15:28,113
Joey, come on!
We just went over this.

256
00:15:28,473 --> 00:15:30,347
We did that when that bird...

257
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,611
...flew over with the fish
in his mouth.

258
00:15:32,926 --> 00:15:34,515
Did you see it? It was gross.

259
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,822
I did not see the bird or the fish!

260
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,161
I did not see the piece of
Styrofoam shaped like Mike Tyson!

261
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:45,622
I did not, because I was trying
to teach you how to sail a boat.

262
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,644
Which obviously is
an impossible thing to do.

263
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:51,956
You're yelling, and I don't
see you taking your top off.

264
00:15:52,235 --> 00:15:53,694
I quit!

265
00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:57,731
- What do you mean? You can't quit.
- Why not?

266
00:15:58,011 --> 00:16:00,893
You're not finished! I won't have it.
Greens do not quit.

267
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:03,461
Greens?

268
00:16:03,856 --> 00:16:06,810
I'm a Tribbiani. Tribbianis quit.

269
00:16:10,223 --> 00:16:11,362
Oh, my God.

270
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:14,603
I just said, "Greens don't quit,"
didn't I?

271
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,060
Did I say, "Greens don't quit"?

272
00:16:16,346 --> 00:16:19,335
Yes! And you're still yelling at me.

273
00:16:19,582 --> 00:16:22,536
No, I'm not yelling at you.
I'm just yelling near you.

274
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,586
Oh, God, Joey. I'm my father.

275
00:16:24,905 --> 00:16:27,503
Oh, my God. This is horrible.

276
00:16:28,662 --> 00:16:32,517
I try so hard not to be my mother,
I didn't see this coming.

277
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:40,240
I'm so sorry.
I just wanted you to learn.

278
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:46,507
I did learn.

279
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:50,123
- Really?
- Yeah, come on.

280
00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:51,901
It's okay.

281
00:16:52,147 --> 00:16:54,021
I know what a mainsail is.

282
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:58,612
I know to duck when
the boom comes across.

283
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:01,921
- I know port is right.
- Left.

284
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,411
Damn it!

285
00:17:06,724 --> 00:17:09,120
What are we gonna do
with all these cookies?

286
00:17:10,134 --> 00:17:11,379
Joey.

287
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,896
It would make my grandmother happy...

288
00:17:15,178 --> 00:17:18,060
...that we're trying
to figure out her recipe.

289
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:22,793
I bet she's looking up at us
and smiling right now.

290
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:26,237
Looking up?

291
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:31,042
She was really nice to me,
but she's in hell for sure.

292
00:17:32,922 --> 00:17:33,990
Well, I've tried everything.

293
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:35,974
I give up.
I'm not gonna be the mom...

294
00:17:36,297 --> 00:17:37,851
...who makes the world's
best cookies.

295
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,316
I do make the best
duck confit with broccoli raab.

296
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,707
Kids love that, right?

297
00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:50,386
Isn't there any relative
that has the recipe?

298
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:52,089
What about your sister?

299
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:55,147
No. I made a promise to
myself that the next time...

300
00:17:55,398 --> 00:17:58,494
...I would talk to Ursula
is over my dead body.

301
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:04,546
And that's not happening
till October 15, 2032.

302
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:07,044
That's the day you're gonna die?

303
00:18:07,366 --> 00:18:09,383
I've got shuffleboard that day.

304
00:18:11,054 --> 00:18:11,990
That's what you think.

305
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:19,536
What about friends of your grandma?
Wouldn't they have the recipe?

306
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:23,855
I may have relatives in France
who would know.

307
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:29,107
My grandmother said she got it from
her grandmother, "Nestley Toulouse."

308
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:31,996
What was her name?

309
00:18:32,764 --> 00:18:35,434
Nestley Toulouse.

310
00:18:37,322 --> 00:18:39,611
Nestlé Toll House?

311
00:18:44,976 --> 00:18:47,550
You Americans always butcher
the French language.

312
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:51,965
Phoebe, is this the recipe?

313
00:18:54,544 --> 00:18:55,897
Yes!

314
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:00,135
Oh.

315
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:02,538
I cannot believe that I spent...

316
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,866
...two days figuring out that recipe.

317
00:19:05,155 --> 00:19:06,578
It was here the whole time!

318
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:10,718
I know! You see,
it is stuff like this...

319
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,432
...which is why
you're burning in hell!

320
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,791
So you understand.

321
00:19:19,072 --> 00:19:21,539
I'd feel better if you
didn't tell what happened.

322
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:24,666
I'm a little embarrassed about it.

323
00:19:24,952 --> 00:19:26,790
I understand completely.

324
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,717
Nothing's scarier than embarrassing
yourself in front of your in-laws.

325
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,168
As a matter of fact, when I started
dating Judy, I was unemployed.

326
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:37,677
Her father asked me
what I did for a living.

327
00:19:37,964 --> 00:19:39,660
I said I was a lawyer.

328
00:19:40,156 --> 00:19:42,338
- What'd you do when they found out?
- They never did.

329
00:19:42,591 --> 00:19:46,375
So if you ever see me giving them
legal advice, just nod along.

330
00:19:47,914 --> 00:19:49,088
Shall we?

331
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:07,078
So, I guess we wear swimsuits in here.

332
00:20:18,461 --> 00:20:21,688
Well, Joey, I hate to admit it...

333
00:20:21,941 --> 00:20:24,408
...your way of sailing
is a lot more fun.

334
00:20:27,124 --> 00:20:30,280
Why don't you give a pull
on that rope?

335
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,612
We're not sailing.

336
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,056
- Just pull on it.
- All right.

337
00:20:39,963 --> 00:20:41,457
Sandwiches!

338
00:20:41,737 --> 00:20:43,266
What else?

339
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:45,840
Here you go.

340
00:20:46,226 --> 00:20:48,207
- Thank you.
- Oh, wow.

341
00:20:51,931 --> 00:20:53,734
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

342
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:57,280
Not like that. You're letting
all the good stuff fall out.

343
00:20:57,637 --> 00:21:01,492
Careful!
You're wasting good pastrami!

344
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:07,056
Oh, my God. I'm my dad!
