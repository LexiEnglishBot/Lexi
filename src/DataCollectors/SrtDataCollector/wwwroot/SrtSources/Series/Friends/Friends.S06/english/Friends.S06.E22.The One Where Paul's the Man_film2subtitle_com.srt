- Hey.

What's the matter?

3
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:09,466
Well, it's just... It's one
of these situations that I just hate.

4
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:12,386
You know,
a massage client gave me three tickets...

5
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,347
...to the Helmut Peltz Exhibit
at the Morgan Chase Museum.

6
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,850
Now you're thinking
you gotta sleep with him.

7
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:22,688
No. No, it's just that he gave me
three tickets and there are six of us.

8
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:25,315
- I'll give up my ticket.
- Me too.

9
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,484
Okay. That's so generous.

10
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,571
And I think Ross is generous too.

11
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,990
Great. Okay. Then it's just us girls.

00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,159
- Great.
- Yeah.

13
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,619
So, what is the exhibit?

14
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,497
It's mostly just photographs...

15
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:45,544
...of, um, lesbian love scenes interspersed
with video games and free sandwiches.

16
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,883
Oh, man.

lesbian sandwich museum this weekend.

00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:08,609
Thanks? But I have plans.
Uh, Elizabeth and I are going out of town.

21
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,027
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

22

that you're gonna make.

23
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,697

24
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,783
Well, her father pays you
for babysitting, right?

25
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,034
- Uh-oh.
- Ha, ha.

26
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,996
No, no. That's funny.
But maybe it's time to move on.

27
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,831
You know, let it go. Stop it.

Besides, Rachel's going out
with Elizabeth's father.

29
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,546
So, uh, he's much older than she is.

Looks like I'm not the only one
interested in fossils. Huh?

31
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:39,431
Ross, all that does is remind us
that you are interested in fossils.

32
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,267
Okay, okay.

33
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:47,940
Uh, well, Rachel's gonna need to yell
sweet nothings in his ear. Huh?

34
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,363
- Ross?
- Oh, come on, that's funny, you know?

35
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,533

you know?

36
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,410

since Lizzie likes you so much...

41
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,388
...I accept the fact
that you're going out with her.

42
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,473
Really? Okay, that's great.

43
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,393
Yeah. But then I changed my mind.

44
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,270
I'm funny like that.

45
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,106
So I've told Lizzie
and now I'm telling you.

my daughter anymore.

Yes, it does.

But Elizabeth and I are both adults...

50
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:44,872
...and so I don't think there's really
anything you can do about it.

your relationship and have you fired.

to put your name down.

in putting my name down.

And I just put our names down for fun.

328
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,713
- I mean, what's the harm in that?
- Right here.

330
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,636
Please don't think I was trying
to pressure you.

331
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,055
- Phoebe and Rachel just thought...
- Phoebe and Rachel?

332
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,683
So the people that knew
about our wedding before me were you...

333
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,560
...Phoebe and Rachel, Hildy...

334
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,313
...and apparently some band called
Star Light Magic Seven...

335
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,024
...who are available, by the way.

336
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,361
It was a mistake.

337
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:42,156
Please don't take this to mean anything,
because it doesn't.

338
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,327
Okay.

339
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,412
Really?

340
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:52,500
Yes. If it really doesn't mean anything,
because you know I'm just not ready.

341
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,753
I know.

342
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,546
Okay.

343
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,340
All right.

344
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,176
Now, I'm gonna go tell Joey
that you're back.

345
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,679
We were really worried about you.

346
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:13,187
- Hey, did she buy it?
- Totally.

347
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:17,525
- So did Hildy show you the place?
- Yeah. It's beautiful.

348
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,861
I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica
to marry you.

349
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,321
I know.

350
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,168
- Hey, Gunther.
- Take these cappuccinos to Table 11.

351
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,671
And that guy over there wants
some biscotti.

352
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,216
Oh. Well, I just actually came in
for a cup of coffee to go.

353
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,012
Do you still work here?

354
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,308
No, no. I quit a long time ago.

355
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,060
Did I forget to tell you that? I'm sorry.

356
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,147
- Oh, it's cool. I was gonna fire you anyway.
- Great.
