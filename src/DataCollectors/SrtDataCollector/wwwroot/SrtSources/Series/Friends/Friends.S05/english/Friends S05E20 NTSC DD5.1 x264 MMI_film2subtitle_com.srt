1
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:04,678
Okay, guys, listen.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,475
Tomorrow, Emily gets married again.

3
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:10,517
So try to really keep
Ross' mind off of it.

4
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:12,054
Good idea.

5
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:13,851
Hey, man. What's up?

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,856
Just thinking about Emily
getting married tomorrow.

7
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:22,356
Oh, Ross! Look, look!

8
00:00:24,336 --> 00:00:25,360
What? Where?

9
00:00:25,571 --> 00:00:28,233
Right over there! There!
Look, look, look!

10
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:32,576
-What am l looking at?
-Somebody help me out here.

11
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:34,568
Hey!

12
00:00:36,248 --> 00:00:39,217
Monica, sorry l didn't come by.
l was out with Gary.

13
00:00:39,484 --> 00:00:43,887
He let me ride around with him.
We saw and prevented crimes.

14
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:46,214
You got to go on a ride-along?

15
00:00:46,425 --> 00:00:48,893
-l want to go on a ride-along!
-Me too!

16
00:00:49,094 --> 00:00:50,755
-Okay.
-Yeah! Me too!

17
00:00:51,063 --> 00:00:52,553
Really? You?

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,989
Yeah.

19
00:00:57,102 --> 00:01:00,560
-Well, it's kind of dangerous.
-Well, l like danger.

20
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:03,271
-Okay, you guys free tonight?
-Yeah!

21
00:01:04,843 --> 00:01:07,676
You didn't say
it was gonna be at nighttime.

22
00:01:11,717 --> 00:01:14,151
The One With the Ride-Along

23
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:02,362
l'm so glad you're home.
We can finally organize these photos.

24
00:02:02,634 --> 00:02:04,602
Oh, thank God!

25
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:06,031
Finally!

26
00:02:07,406 --> 00:02:09,874
l've broken them down
into categories.

27
00:02:10,075 --> 00:02:12,976
We got holidays,
birthdays, candids....

28
00:02:13,178 --> 00:02:15,510
And l've cross-referenced
them by subject.

29
00:02:15,714 --> 00:02:17,739
So if you're looking up, say...

30
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,883
...birthdays and dogs,
you get photo 1 52.

31
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:22,075
See?

32
00:02:23,855 --> 00:02:25,982
Oh, it's me and LePoo.

33
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:28,491
Wow, l miss that dog.

34
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:31,662
You can also find him
under ''dog'' and ''dead.''

35
00:02:33,932 --> 00:02:34,921
Great. Thanks.

36
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:39,000
Hand me that other box of photos.
That's the last one.

37
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,070
Oops.

38
00:02:46,778 --> 00:02:47,904
Sorry.

39
00:02:48,113 --> 00:02:49,944
Good thing you numbered them.

40
00:02:50,148 --> 00:02:51,137
l hadn't.

41
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,180
Photo 1 52 was a prototype.

42
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:57,780
Honey, it's okay. lt's okay.

43
00:02:58,056 --> 00:03:01,219
How about l fix you a drink?
Maybe a margarita?

44
00:03:01,727 --> 00:03:03,251
Ross has the blender.

45
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:06,858
Everything's just falling apart.

46
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,700
lt's okay. l'll go to Ross',
get the blender.

47
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:13,360
-You get the margarita stuff ready.
-All right.

48
00:03:13,572 --> 00:03:16,405
His keys are in the drawer.
Also, l need some cash.

49
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:17,972
Want me to stop at the ATM?

50
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:21,542
No. While you're at Ross',
if you see any lying around.

51
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:25,413
-What?
-What?

52
00:03:25,584 --> 00:03:27,575
l don't do that.

53
00:03:37,496 --> 00:03:41,330
That was so cool, man.
The way you leaned on that guy.

54
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:44,057
lt is starting to get dark out there.

55
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,398
He told you everything.
You cracked him.

56
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,938
He was the victim.
They're usually pretty talkative.

57
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,670
Okay, but it is officially nighttime.

58
00:03:56,248 --> 00:03:59,274
-Want me to grab the berry for you?
-lt's called a cherry.

59
00:03:59,484 --> 00:04:01,315
lt's called--
Chandler!

60
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:09,019
Okay, l got it.

61
00:04:09,427 --> 00:04:12,521
This place makes the
best sandwich in the world.

62
00:04:12,798 --> 00:04:14,493
Does it have meatballs?

63
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:15,688
Oh, yeah.

64
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:17,528
Melted cheese and marinara sauce?

65
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:18,825
Yep.

66
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:21,002
You can't eat that in my car.

67
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:24,433
Yeah, okay.

68
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,270
Even though my tax dollars
paid for this car.

69
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:31,372
Your tax dollars?

70
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:35,151
Yeah, okay.

71
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:44,219
Wow, that sandwich smells good.

72
00:04:44,462 --> 00:04:46,327
Did l say you could smell it?

73
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,661
l can't smell it?

74
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:53,504
Half the taste is in the smell.
You're sucking up all the taste units.

75
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:56,200
Okay, l'll give them back.

76
00:04:59,377 --> 00:05:01,004
What is so great about that sandwich?

77
00:05:02,914 --> 00:05:06,247
lmagine the best sex you ever had.

78
00:05:06,518 --> 00:05:08,713
-Are you thinking about Monica?
-Yeah.

79
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:10,043
What's that like?

80
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:26,563
Please don't be from a real dinosaur.
Please, please.

81
00:05:26,872 --> 00:05:28,533
Please, please.

82
00:05:30,575 --> 00:05:32,941
''Made in Mexico.''
Yes!

83
00:05:35,046 --> 00:05:37,173
Who would buy this?

84
00:05:44,623 --> 00:05:46,284
<i>Rach, it's me. Pick up!</i>

85
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,949
What's up?

86
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:52,196
<i>I need a few more things</i>
<i>for the margaritas.</i>

87
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,924
l need some salt,
some margarita mix and tequila.

88
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,537
So all we had was ice?

89
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:02,305
See if he has ice.

90
00:06:16,388 --> 00:06:17,412
<i>Hello, Ross?</i>

91
00:06:17,622 --> 00:06:19,089
<i>It's Emily here.</i>

92
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:23,387
<i>I know this is out of the blue,</i>
<i>but I'm getting married tomorrow.</i>

93
00:06:23,595 --> 00:06:25,495
<i>Well, maybe I am....</i>

94
00:06:25,764 --> 00:06:27,732
<i>I keep thinking about you.</i>

95
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:32,129
<i>And I'm wondering if we made</i>
<i>a mistake giving up so fast.</i>

96
00:06:32,337 --> 00:06:33,998
<i>Are you thinking about me?</i>

97
00:06:34,472 --> 00:06:37,964
<i>No, of course you're not.</i>
<i>But if you are, call me tonight.</i>

98
00:06:38,176 --> 00:06:39,905
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

99
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:50,143
Where we going?

100
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:53,655
This witness won't return my calls.
We'll surprise him coming home.

101
00:06:53,858 --> 00:06:57,521
Surprise him? We're not gonna
make anybody mad, are we?

102
00:06:57,996 --> 00:06:59,623
Come on, man.

103
00:06:59,831 --> 00:07:04,097
You gonna squeeze the perp's shoes
a bit before he lawyers up?

104
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:06,964
He's a witness, not a perp.
And no one talks like that.

105
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:10,997
Yeah. No one talks like that.

106
00:07:11,276 --> 00:07:14,939
-Oh, what, like you're Mr. Cop?
-l'm more cop than you two.

107
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,807
How do you figure that?

108
00:07:17,015 --> 00:07:19,279
l'm in the front seat, okay?

109
00:07:20,051 --> 00:07:21,882
l'm Gary's partner.

110
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,282
When you say ''partner,''
it doesn't sound cop.

111
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:27,184
lt sounds gay.

112
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,320
Jealous.

113
00:07:32,063 --> 00:07:35,328
-Hey, we're undercover here.
-Oh, yeah. No problem.

114
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:38,399
-Ross!
-Sorry.

115
00:07:39,571 --> 00:07:40,697
There.

116
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:45,639
Hey, Gary. Who am l?

117
00:07:45,844 --> 00:07:47,539
Phone home.

118
00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:54,010
Look at Officer Ross riding
back here with the visitors.

119
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,854
What's up with that, Serpico?

120
00:07:58,723 --> 00:08:01,191
''What's up with that, Serpico?''

121
00:08:03,962 --> 00:08:07,193
<i>Are you thinking about me?</i>
<i>No, of course you're not.</i>

122
00:08:07,465 --> 00:08:09,456
<i>But if you are, call me tonight.</i>

123
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,328
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

124
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:14,471
No.

125
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:17,572
l know!

126
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:22,207
Thank God you were here.
We have to erase that.

127
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:24,243
What? We can't do that.

128
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:26,541
We have to.
What if Ross hears that...

129
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:28,912
...and calls her back and
they get back together?

130
00:08:29,154 --> 00:08:32,146
ls that what you want?
Ross back with that controlling...

131
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,826
...neurotic, crazy Emily?
The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?

132
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:38,092
No! Oh, no, no.

133
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:40,923
God, no! He should not
get back with her.

134
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:44,691
l know that, you know that.
Even Ross knows that.

135
00:08:44,903 --> 00:08:47,201
But we have no right
to erase his message.

136
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:52,035
Look, l'm his sister and l love him.
l don't want to see him get hurt.

137
00:08:52,277 --> 00:08:54,404
Doesn't that give me
the right to control him--?

138
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:58,040
Help him?

139
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:01,249
He's not the one who needs help.

140
00:09:03,354 --> 00:09:05,049
She's obviously unstable.

141
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,691
She's thinking about running
out on her wedding day.

142
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:15,956
Okay, fine. But look at the
position she's putting him in.

143
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:18,362
And what's he gonna do?

144
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,630
Run over there on the wedding day
and break up the marriage?

145
00:09:21,906 --> 00:09:23,737
Who would do that?

146
00:09:27,412 --> 00:09:30,973
Okay, fine. All right.
But that was different.

147
00:09:31,883 --> 00:09:34,579
Although it did involve
a lot of the same people.

148
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,289
This is some twisted joke
she's playing on him.

149
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,653
You are crazy.
She sounded genuinely upset.

150
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:43,121
l mean, listen.

151
00:09:43,394 --> 00:09:45,658
<i>Your messages have been erased.</i>

152
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,557
No!

153
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:52,867
Well, that worked out well. Margarita?

154
00:09:58,243 --> 00:10:01,974
Okay, but we're safe, right?
Nothing bad's gonna go down.

155
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,512
No. But that reminds me.
Sign this.

156
00:10:04,782 --> 00:10:05,840
What is it?

157
00:10:06,117 --> 00:10:08,779
lt just says you can't sue
if you scrape your knee...

158
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,647
...or get your head blown off.

159
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:15,125
Oh, hurry up. l want to sign that.

160
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:17,183
Here he comes.

161
00:10:18,763 --> 00:10:21,027
What is he doing?
What the hell is he doing?

162
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:22,255
What is it?

163
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:23,923
-ls everything okay?
-What?

164
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:27,502
He sees us. Don't move.
And don't look at him!

165
00:10:42,787 --> 00:10:45,722
Hey, it's okay.
lt was just a car backfire.

166
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:49,554
Hey, look at that.
You tried to save your buddy.

167
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:51,954
You see that?

168
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,891
You see what he did?

169
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:55,999
You okay, man?

170
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:00,895
Thanks, Joey.

171
00:11:03,474 --> 00:11:04,736
Hello?

172
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,010
Hi.

173
00:11:10,882 --> 00:11:12,611
You all right?

174
00:11:16,654 --> 00:11:17,780
We should go.

175
00:11:17,956 --> 00:11:18,945
No, wait.

176
00:11:19,123 --> 00:11:20,181
Oh, yeah. Right.

177
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:21,889
No. Monica.

178
00:11:23,161 --> 00:11:24,992
Monica, we have to fix this.

179
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,323
What can we do?
You erased the message.

180
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:32,463
Yeah, but maybe l could call his machine
and re-create the message.

181
00:11:32,637 --> 00:11:34,104
All right, okay....

182
00:11:34,906 --> 00:11:37,397
Hello, Ross, this is Rachel-- Emily.

183
00:11:37,976 --> 00:11:41,912
God, what is it with those two names?

184
00:11:42,947 --> 00:11:48,078
l do so wanted to say
that l'm going to be getting married...

185
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:51,484
...to another British person.

186
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:57,720
And l'm having doubts and scones....

187
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,857
-l can't remember what she said.
-Yeah, that's the problem with this plan.

188
00:12:03,234 --> 00:12:06,362
Rachel, come on. The message
is erased, there's nothing we can do.

189
00:12:06,537 --> 00:12:08,027
He's never gonna find out.

190
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:09,696
l could tell him about it.

191
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:13,674
lf you want to be rational,
l can't argue with you.

192
00:12:13,978 --> 00:12:15,002
All right?

193
00:12:15,713 --> 00:12:19,046
Fine, tell him. l just don't
want to be a part of it.

194
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:24,151
Maybe that's Emily leaving
the exact same message.

195
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,893
<i>Hey, Ross, it's you. I just</i>
<i>want you to remember this feeling.</i>

196
00:12:30,495 --> 00:12:33,089
<i>You are lucky to be alive.</i>

197
00:12:33,364 --> 00:12:36,561
<i>So live every day to the fullest.</i>

198
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:39,166
<i>Love yourself, okay?</i>

199
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:42,262
<i>And also get stamps. Bye.</i>

200
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:47,500
Play that message for Emily,
and this problem goes away.

201
00:12:47,745 --> 00:12:48,837
Right?

202
00:12:50,415 --> 00:12:52,212
Anybody want to meet a hero?

203
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,577
John Glenn is here?

204
00:12:55,286 --> 00:12:56,344
No. Joey.

205
00:12:56,788 --> 00:12:58,756
Joey's never been in outer space.

206
00:13:00,258 --> 00:13:02,488
We had the most incredible night.

207
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:04,991
-We're in the car--
-Wait. Hold on.

208
00:13:07,765 --> 00:13:08,754
-Hi.
-Hi.

209
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:10,796
Okay, go ahead.

210
00:13:11,636 --> 00:13:15,402
So we're in the car, and bang!
A shot was fired.

211
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,139
And Joey, with no regard
for his own safety...

212
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,435
...throws himself on me.

213
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,737
My God!

214
00:13:23,014 --> 00:13:25,482
lt was a car backfire.

215
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,183
But he didn't know that.

216
00:13:27,452 --> 00:13:29,113
Yeah, l didn't know that.

217
00:13:31,122 --> 00:13:34,023
lt could just as easily
have been a bullet.

218
00:13:34,258 --> 00:13:37,284
Ever think about joining the force?
We could use a guy like you.

219
00:13:37,528 --> 00:13:39,587
Who jumps at loud noises.

220
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:44,659
Wow. l could have died tonight.

221
00:13:44,902 --> 00:13:47,769
Yeah, if the car that backfired
had run over you!

222
00:13:49,006 --> 00:13:53,272
l'm gonna go home, before Ross starts
rambling about his newfound respect for life.

223
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:57,208
l do have a newfound respect for life.

224
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,883
Oh, my God!

225
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,951
Ross, l could have told you
you weren't gonna die today.

226
00:14:06,124 --> 00:14:08,684
What? You know when l'm gonna die?

227
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,328
-You want to get some dinner?
-Sure.

228
00:14:17,368 --> 00:14:20,701
You know what? lf l heard a shot
right now, l'd throw my body on you.

229
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:23,566
Maybe we should walk
in a bad neighborhood.

230
00:14:23,841 --> 00:14:25,069
Okay.

231
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:27,466
Bye.

232
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,677
Cut it out.

233
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:38,652
l'd hate to save your life
and kick your ass on the same day.

234
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:50,356
Why'd you take off?

235
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:52,828
Just going for a walk.

236
00:14:53,538 --> 00:14:55,529
Around the living room, whatever.

237
00:14:56,674 --> 00:15:00,110
-ls something wrong?
-No. No, l'm just tired.

238
00:15:00,378 --> 00:15:02,608
You know, from the walk.

239
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:07,209
You dove in front of Ross!

240
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:09,008
Ross!

241
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:12,189
That's what this is about.

242
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:17,056
Oh, my God. You hate Ross!

243
00:15:18,262 --> 00:15:19,388
l don't hate Ross.

244
00:15:19,597 --> 00:15:23,397
Of course you do. l saved him.
You're mad at me. lt adds up.

245
00:15:23,634 --> 00:15:26,194
You want Ross out of the picture.

246
00:15:26,904 --> 00:15:27,893
What picture?

247
00:15:28,105 --> 00:15:30,767
l don't know.
But l don't like what l'm hearing.

248
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:34,940
l'm glad you saved Ross in the car backfire.
But it could've been a bullet.

249
00:15:35,213 --> 00:15:37,408
And you didn't try to save me.

250
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:42,648
You're upset because you think
l chose Ross over you.

251
00:15:42,887 --> 00:15:47,085
No, l knew you could
take care of yourself.

252
00:15:47,558 --> 00:15:51,494
You know? l mean, Ross needs help.
He's not ''street'' like us.

253
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:55,330
You'd risk your life for Ross
before you would for me.

254
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:57,227
That's the bottom line.

255
00:15:58,603 --> 00:16:00,161
No, not exactly.

256
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:01,999
All right, look.

257
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,240
l wasn't trying to save Ross.

258
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,132
Okay?

259
00:16:08,412 --> 00:16:11,074
My sandwich was next to Ross.

260
00:16:13,017 --> 00:16:14,006
All right?

261
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:18,584
l was trying to save my sandwich.

262
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,153
From a bullet?

263
00:16:23,194 --> 00:16:26,527
-l know it doesn't make much sense.
-''Much'' sense?

264
00:16:27,331 --> 00:16:29,925
Look, it was instinct!
l just went for it.

265
00:16:30,134 --> 00:16:32,534
You risked your life for a sandwich?

266
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,795
l know it sounds crazy...

267
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:38,837
...but this is the greatest
sandwich in the world!

268
00:16:41,612 --> 00:16:44,445
So you didn't choose Ross before me?

269
00:16:44,682 --> 00:16:47,116
No. l would never do that.

270
00:16:47,351 --> 00:16:49,216
You're like my brother.

271
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:52,180
-Really?
-Yeah.

272
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,483
ln fact, to prove how much
you mean to me....

273
00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:03,132
Here.

274
00:17:03,634 --> 00:17:06,364
-Thanks.
-Easy, it's not a hot dog!

275
00:17:12,643 --> 00:17:14,304
How good is that?

276
00:17:17,081 --> 00:17:18,173
See?

277
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:19,880
What are you doing?

278
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:23,816
You're showing me how much
l mean to you.

279
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:25,386
With a bite.

280
00:17:26,324 --> 00:17:27,655
Jeez!

281
00:17:46,177 --> 00:17:47,701
What are you doing here?

282
00:17:47,912 --> 00:17:48,901
Hey, you know what?

283
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,776
You are in our apartment
all the time!

284
00:17:51,949 --> 00:17:54,509
This is just a drop
in the bucket, mister!

285
00:17:56,354 --> 00:18:00,552
lt doesn't matter. The important
thing is that you're here.

286
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,760
You're my friend and you're here.

287
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:12,366
Okay, just a little scared.
What's going on?

288
00:18:12,603 --> 00:18:15,128
The most amazing thing
happened tonight.

289
00:18:15,373 --> 00:18:17,068
l thought my number was up.

290
00:18:17,241 --> 00:18:20,768
l had an actual near-death experience.

291
00:18:21,045 --> 00:18:22,239
What happened?

292
00:18:22,546 --> 00:18:26,915
We were on the ride-along with Gary
and somebody took a shot at me!

293
00:18:30,321 --> 00:18:31,310
Really?

294
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:33,647
No. A car backfired.

295
00:18:36,093 --> 00:18:39,824
But l thought somebody was taking
a shot at me. And, Rach...

296
00:18:40,297 --> 00:18:41,821
...l survived!

297
00:18:43,634 --> 00:18:47,661
And l was filled with
this great respect for life.

298
00:18:47,938 --> 00:18:50,168
l want to experience every moment.

299
00:18:50,474 --> 00:18:53,671
l want to seize every opportunity.

300
00:18:53,944 --> 00:18:57,573
l am seeing everything so clearly now.

301
00:18:57,848 --> 00:18:59,975
Because a car backfired?

302
00:19:00,651 --> 00:19:02,642
Okay. Why are you here?

303
00:19:04,355 --> 00:19:08,587
l don't know how this fits
into your whole ''seizing'' thing...

304
00:19:08,793 --> 00:19:10,351
...but Emily called you today.

305
00:19:11,696 --> 00:19:13,926
-You talked to her?
-She left a message.

306
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:16,031
But it kind of got erased.

307
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,827
l mean, there's something
wrong with your machine.

308
00:19:20,037 --> 00:19:21,436
What did she say?

309
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:26,041
Something about having second
thoughts about the wedding...

310
00:19:26,277 --> 00:19:29,303
...and did you guys make
a mistake breaking up?

311
00:19:29,847 --> 00:19:31,838
And she wants you to call her.

312
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,839
Wow.

313
00:19:34,318 --> 00:19:37,219
That was a good thing
that l told you, right?

314
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:39,886
Yeah. Yes. Of course.

315
00:19:40,157 --> 00:19:43,149
Okay, thank you. Thank you.
Because--

316
00:19:43,394 --> 00:19:45,862
l'm gonna go tell Monica l was right.

317
00:19:46,063 --> 00:19:47,724
Because she didn't want--

318
00:19:47,998 --> 00:19:52,298
Not important. Point is,
l was right. Your decision.

319
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,559
Okay?

320
00:19:53,838 --> 00:19:55,135
l was right.

321
00:19:55,406 --> 00:19:57,135
Your decision.

322
00:19:57,408 --> 00:19:58,397
Right.

323
00:19:59,043 --> 00:20:01,307
l guess l should call Emily.

324
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:03,809
No, that's not the right decision.

325
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:05,515
That's not right.

326
00:20:05,816 --> 00:20:07,010
Ross, come on!

327
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:08,410
l mean...

328
00:20:09,086 --> 00:20:11,077
...that woman made you miserable!

329
00:20:13,057 --> 00:20:15,582
Do you really want
to get back into that?

330
00:20:17,328 --> 00:20:19,023
Okay, look. Yesterday...

331
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:22,390
...l wouldn't have even
considered calling her back.

332
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,100
But my ex-wife calls
on the same day...

333
00:20:25,336 --> 00:20:27,770
...l have a near-death experience?

334
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:30,029
That's gotta mean something.

335
00:20:30,241 --> 00:20:34,837
That was not a near-death experience.
That was barely an experience.

336
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:37,275
You weren't there!

337
00:20:39,283 --> 00:20:43,049
Maybe this is something that
l'm supposed to seize, you know?

338
00:20:44,021 --> 00:20:45,579
Okay. You know what?

339
00:20:46,524 --> 00:20:50,290
Maybe this is not about seizing stuff.

340
00:20:50,594 --> 00:20:54,086
Maybe this is about escaping stuff.

341
00:20:54,732 --> 00:20:56,131
Okay? Look at today.

342
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,958
l mean, you escaped...

343
00:20:58,602 --> 00:20:59,591
...death.

344
00:21:01,806 --> 00:21:05,071
And maybe this is a chance
for you to escape...

345
00:21:05,376 --> 00:21:07,276
...getting back together with Emily.

346
00:21:08,646 --> 00:21:10,204
That does make sense.

347
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:15,746
Because l do want to seize
some opportunity...

348
00:21:15,986 --> 00:21:19,581
...but l really don't want
to see or talk to her.

349
00:21:21,392 --> 00:21:23,223
Well, there you go!

350
00:21:24,628 --> 00:21:26,391
Yeah, maybe today's just...

351
00:21:27,231 --> 00:21:29,392
...''close call'' day.

352
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:33,600
Hey, thanks, Rach.

353
00:21:33,804 --> 00:21:35,499
Oh, honey. No problem.

354
00:21:36,574 --> 00:21:39,168
Wait, wait.
The message is blinking.

355
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:41,306
Maybe you didn't erase it.

356
00:21:41,612 --> 00:21:44,012
<i>Hey, Ross, it's you</i>--

357
00:21:44,682 --> 00:21:48,641
That's an old message.
Nobody needs to hear that.

358
00:21:50,955 --> 00:21:53,287
-Hey, was Monica here?
-Yeah.

359
00:21:53,824 --> 00:21:55,758
l want my money back.

360
00:21:56,827 --> 00:21:59,261
You probably need that
for stamps, right?

361
00:22:07,671 --> 00:22:09,434
Has Gary ever been shot at for real?

362
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,766
Yes, once.

363
00:22:11,976 --> 00:22:13,000
A little.

364
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,508
He kind of did it to himself.

365
00:22:16,146 --> 00:22:18,171
lt's not really a good story.

366
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:22,508
l wonder how l'd react under fire.
And not backfire...

367
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,278
...but heavy fire.

368
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:26,512
Like, if l was in a war.

369
00:22:26,724 --> 00:22:28,658
Man, l would be great in a war!

370
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:31,860
l think l'd make
a fantastic military leader.

371
00:22:32,129 --> 00:22:35,690
l mean, l know l'd make general
before any of you guys.

372
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:39,464
Before or after you were shot
by your own troops?

373
00:22:40,004 --> 00:22:43,804
l know Joey would be in the foxhole
protecting all of us.

374
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:46,738
lf the foxhole was
lined with sandwiches.

375
00:22:48,045 --> 00:22:50,240
Yeah, hero sandwiches.

376
00:22:52,716 --> 00:22:57,210
You all know l'm a pacifist, so l'm
not interested in war in any way.

377
00:22:57,488 --> 00:23:00,753
But when the revolution comes,
l'll have to destroy you all.

378
00:23:01,992 --> 00:23:03,118
Not you, Joey.

379
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:06,919
