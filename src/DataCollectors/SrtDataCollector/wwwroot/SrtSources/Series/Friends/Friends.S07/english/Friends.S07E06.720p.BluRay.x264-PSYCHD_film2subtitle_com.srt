1
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:05,129
The reason I asked you to brunch...

2
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:08,549
...is because I've been thinking
about my maid of honor.

3
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,759
Oh, my God. This is it. Oh.

4
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:12,845
I hope it's you.

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,888
- I hope it's you.
- Me too.

6
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,851
First of all, I love you both so much.

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,063
- You're both so important to me.
- Blah, blah, blah. Who is it?

8
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,734
I was thinking we could
come up with a system...

9
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,111
...where we trade off being maid of honor.

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,614
- Hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
- Yes! Oh.

11
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,743
Hypothetically.

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,077
Still.

13
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:42,416
If Phoebe were mine,
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I'd be Rachel's.

14
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,252
We all get to do it and no one gets upset.

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,757
- That's a pretty good idea.
- I'll do that. So who's yours?

16
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:54,678
Well, that's the best part.
You guys get to decide.

17
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,850
- Why is that the best part?
- I don't have to.

18
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:06,356
Of course we'll help you decide.
We'll do anything we can to help you.

19
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,025
I'd like to make a toast.

20
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,320
To the future Mrs. Chandler Bing...

21
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,532
...my best friend and truly one
of the nicest people that...

22
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,368
- Really not deciding.
- Fine.

23
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,915
Excuse me, I couldn't help overhearing.

24
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,584
- You're marrying Chandler Bing?
- Yeah.

25
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,877
Huh.

26
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,170
Good luck!

27
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,299
Oh, and good luck to you too!

28
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,676
What a nice lady.

29
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,511
Yeah!

30
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,098
- Die Hard, still great.
- Yep.

31
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,142
Let's make it a double feature?

32
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,601
What else did you rent?

33
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,187
Die Hard 2.

34
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,107
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.

35
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:35,571
Well, we'll watch it a second time
and it's Die Hard 2.

36
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,408
- Joey, we just saw it.
- And?

37
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,702
It would be cool to see it again!

38
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,705
- Yeah! Die Hard!
- Die Hard!

39
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,375
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard.

40
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,878
Is everything okay?

41
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,839
Yeah, I just got plans.

42
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,342
Well, John McClane had plans.

43
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:01,305
I want to leave before
Joey gets all worked up...

44
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,891
...and starts calling everybody "bitch."

45
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,020
What are you talking about, bitch?

46
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,608
- Hey, Rachel.
- Yeah?

47
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:16,403
When I get married,
will you be my maid of honor?

48
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,988
Really?

49
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,533
Oh, my God, Phoebe. I mean, I'm just...

50
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,202
Wait a minute.

51
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:30,167
If I'm your maid of honor,
that means that you are Monica's.

52
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,127
Oh.

53
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,547
- Well, if that's what you want.
- Oh!

54
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,176
No way, Phoebe. I want to be Monica's.

55
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,679
- Why does it even matter?
- Why does it matter to you?

56
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,307
Because this one is now.

57
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,060
And it's two of our best friends.

58
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,187
And who knows what you're gonna marry.

59
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:56,193
What if I marry Ross? Or Joey?

60
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,363
You wouldn't.

61
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:04,910
Okay, look, Rachel.
I know you really want to do this...

62
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:08,455
...but I've never been
maid of honor to anyone before.

63
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,874
I know you've done it at least twice.

64
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,086
- Yeah, but, Phoebe...
- Please let me finish.

65
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,214
I guess that was it.

66
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,592
Okay.

67
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:24,846
Okay. Since you've never done it before,
you can be Monica's maid of honor.

68
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,057
Oh, thank you so much!

69
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,352
Yay.

70
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,064
I'm gonna marry someone good.

71
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,733
Oh, I know.

72
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,319
- Better than Chandler.
- Pfft.

73
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,466
- What happened?
- I don't know.

74
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,594
We fell asleep. That is all.

75
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,639
Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.

76
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,976
All right, well, I'd better go.

77
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,103
- I think that would be best.
- Yeah.

78
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,022
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

79
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:18,650
- But not about this.
- No, never. Never!

80
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,278
- So, uh...
- Uh...

81
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,364
- Bye.
- No touch. No touch.

82
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,454
Hey, a weird thing happened at brunch.

83
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,956
This woman overheard
that I was marrying you...

84
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,334
...and she wished me good luck.

85
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,793
That's sweet.

86
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,963
No, it was more like a "good luck."

87
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,633
So, what did this woman look like?

88
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,136
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.

89
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:50,891
Any chance you were looking into
a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?

90
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,602
Was it someone you dated in college?

91
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,104
No, I only dated two girls in college...

92
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,775
...both blond, both not attractive.

93
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,277
Let me check this out.

94
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,113
- What are you doing?
- Well, let's see.

95
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:08,200
Okay, uh, is that her?

96
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,826
Oh, my God, yes!

97
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:14,039
- Who is she?
- Julie Graff, my camp girlfriend.

98
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,832
Did you break up with her?

99
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,336
No, we're still together.

100
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,843
We went out for two summers
and then I broke up with her.

101
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,012
- Why?
- She came back the third summer...

102
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,724
...and she'd gotten really fa... Ahh.

103
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,563
- Fat?
- I did not say fat.

104
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,108
I said fa... Ahh.

105
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,487
You broke up with a girl
because she was fat?

106
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,447
Yeah. Yeah.

107
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:51,993
But it was a really long time ago.
Does she still feel bad?

108
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,537
Apparently she does.

109
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,998
You know what they say,
"Elephants never forget."

110
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,338
Seriously, good luck marrying me.

111
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,927
Hey, what's going on?

112
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,096
Phoebe is gonna be
Monica's maid of honor.

113
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:15,851
Hey. Hope it goes better than the last time
you did it for that girl downstairs.

114
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,564
You have been maid of honor before?

115
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:24,651
You see? This is exactly why
you shouldn't lie.

116
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,446
That's it. I am maid of honor.

117
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,781
- No, I am.
- How come you are?

118
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,576
Because I cared enough to lie.

119
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,704
Hey, I could help you decide
who should do it.

120
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,622
We could have an audition.

121
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,709
See how you'd handle
maid-of-honor-type situations.

122
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,086
- What are you talking about?
- When I want a job...

123
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,298
...I audition and if I'm the best
of the people they see...

124
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,091
...they give me the part.

125
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,719
Okay, so after this audition,
who decides who gets it?

126
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,138
Oh, me and Ross can be the judges.

127
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,224
- It's better than us deciding.
- Oh, this is crazy.

128
00:07:56,392 --> 00:08:00,395
- Can't we just flip a coin?
- No, coins hate me.

129
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:05,192
Okay, fine. You know what?
We will let Ross and Joey decide.

130
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,110
Hi!

131
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,529
Ross, sweetie.

132
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,659
Hey there, handsome thing.

133
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:22,918
Wow, this cologne really is
every bit as good as Giorgio.

134
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,133
Hey.

135
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,428
Just brought back your videos.

136
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:37,557
Hey, Ross. Look, I think
we need to talk about before.

137
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,976
No. No, we don't.

138
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,144
Yes, we do.

139
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,940
Now, look. That was the best nap I ever had.

140
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,531
I don't know what you're talking about.

141
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,741
Come on, admit it.

142
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,952
That was the best nap you ever had.

143
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,871
I've had better.

144
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,625
Okay. When?

145
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,963
All right! All right!
It was the best nap ever!

146
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,673
- Ah!
- I said it, okay?

147
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,925
But it's over, Joey!

148
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,387
I want to do it again.

149
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,476
We can't do it again.

150
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,354
- Why not?
- Because it's weird!

151
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,315
Fine.

152
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,442
You want a drink?

153
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,196
- Sure. What do you got?
- Warm milk and Excedrin PM.

154
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,038
Chandler.

155
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,916
I just figured out who you are.

156
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,586
Can you figure out what I'm doing?

157
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,423
- You're Louis Posen.
- Who?

158
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,051
He was my best friend in fifth grade.

159
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:58,471
One day, I asked him to be
my boyfriend and he said no.

160
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,973
Do you know why?

161
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:04,352
Because you kept talking to him while
he was trying to go to the bathroom?

162
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:08,106
No, but because he thought
I was too fa... Ahh.

163
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,403
Every time I think about it,
I feel as bad as I did then.

164
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,364
I really think you should
apologize to Julie.

165
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,618
Honey, are you kidding?
That was like 16 years ago.

166
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,996
It would make me feel better
if Louis apologized to me.

167
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:27,250
I'll do it. But I warn you,
this may make me a better person.

168
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,462
And that is not the man
you fell in love with.

169
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,882
This is how it's gonna work.

170
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,635
We'll give you hypothetical
maid-of-honor situations.

171
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,095
You'll be scored on a scale of one to 10.

172
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,723
- One being the highest.
- Ten is the highest.

173
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,517
- Why is 10 the highest?
- Because it's the highest.

174
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,357
Okay, Rachel, you're up first.

175
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,401
Situation number one:
You're with Monica.

176
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:57,697
The wedding is about to start
when Monica gets cold feet. Go!

177
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,283
I don't want to marry Chandler.

178
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,619
- I've got cold feet.
- It's gonna be okay.

179
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,413
One man the rest of my life?
I don't know.

180
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,083
This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey.

181
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,671
Look, Monica...

182
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,714
...getting cold feet is very common.

183
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,550
It's just because of all the anticipation.

184
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:21,930
And you just have to remember
that you love Chandler.

185
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,683
And also, I ran out on a wedding.

186
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,644
You don't get to keep the gifts.

187
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,397
Very good,
drawing on your own experience.

188
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,940
Very good.

189
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,484
Yes, very nice, Rachel.

190
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,944
Thank you, judges.

191
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,113
- Kiss-ass.
- Oh.

192
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,617
- Okay, Phoebe.
- Yes, Your Honor.

193
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,161
We're now in the ceremony.

194
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,414
Monica is about to say, "I do"...

195
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,999
...when her drunk uncle starts yelling.

196
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,584
What do you do? Go!

197
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,421
When Monica was a little girl...

198
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,672
...I remember that...

199
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,760
Ow!

200
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,512
- Very good!
- Oh.

201
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,223
Yes, excellent. Perfect score.

202
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,768
She just made a scene
in the middle of the ceremony!

203
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,771
Hey, you want a little taste of Pheebs?

204
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:17,152
It is time for you to give
your maid-of-honor speech.

205
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,903
We haven't even prepared...

206
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,323
- Go!
- Okay, okay, okay. Um...

207
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,118
Webster's Dictionary
defines marriage as...

208
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:29,664
Okay, no! Forget that! That sucks!
Okay, never mind. Forget it. Um, um...

209
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:34,961
I met... I met Monica when we were
just a couple of 6-year-olds...

210
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:40,175
...and became friends with Chandler
when he was 25...

211
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,136
...although he seemed like a 6-year-old.

212
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,971
Oh.

213
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,475
Thank you. Thank you very much. Um...

214
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,228
I've known them separately and together.

215
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:58,026
To know them as a couple is to know
that you are truly in the presence of love.

216
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,488
So I would like to raise my glass...

217
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,281
...to Monica and Chandler...

218
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:08,077
...and the beautiful adventure they
are about to embark upon together.

219
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:11,956
I can think of no two people
better prepared for the journey.

220
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,250
Wow.

221
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,962
- Great speech.
- Yeah, it really was.

222
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,255
Oh, thanks.

223
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:24,302
Okay, Phoebe, I guess you're next.
Although I really don't see the point.

224
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,890
Okay.

225
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,562
I can't believe that Monica
and Chandler are getting married.

226
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,273
I remember talking
about this day with Rachel...

227
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,610
...while we were showering together, naked.

228
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,036
And she's back in the game!

229
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:00,922
Julie. Hi.

230
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,383
Chandler Bing. I guess you remember me.

231
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,010
Hello, Skidmark.

232
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,140
It's a nickname. I'll explain later.

233
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,351
It's pretty clear.

234
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:19,315
I owe you a long-overdue apology.

235
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,986
I shouldn't have broken up with you
because you were overweight.

236
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,738
That's why you broke up with me?

237
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,160
You didn't know that?

238
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,456
Well, I guess my work here is done.

239
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:44,591
First of all, I would like to say
you both performed very well, okay?

240
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,843
You should be proud.

241
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:51,764
And I'd also like to say,
in this competition, there are no losers.

242
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,475
Well, except Rachel. Damn it!

243
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,604
Really? I won?

244
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,773
- What?
- I'm sorry, Rach, it was really close.

245
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:04,694
- Well, then I demand a recount!
- Actually, it wasn't that close.

246
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,947
You know what?
Your thing was so stupid anyway.

247
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,450
We're gonna flip a coin, all right?

248
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,411
Heads. Oh!

249
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,831
What? The coins have finally forgiven me!

250
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,961
You know what? I hope Monica
forgives you after you throw her...

251
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:26,966
...her vegetarian-voodoo-goddess-circle-y
shower.

252
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:32,055
Rach, it's gonna be okay.
You guys are the best!

253
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:38,019
Boy, I tell you. That judging stuff
took a lot out of me.

254
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,395
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

255
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:44,067
Thinking about maybe going upstairs
and taking a little nap on my couch.

256
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,530
Why would I care about that?

257
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,743
No reason. I'm just saying that...

258
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,245
...that's where I'll be.

259
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,019
As bad as that went,
I actually enjoyed myself.

260
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:24,524
I think that I'm going to apologize
for all the stupid things that I do.

261
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,318
Why don't you just stop
doing stupid things?

262
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:31,656
- Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
- I'd love it if I could do both.

263
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,662
All right, I have to ask.

264
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,497
What?

265
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,709
Will you break up with me if I get fat again?

266
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,085
What?

267
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,588
You broke up with Julie.
How much weight did she gain?

268
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,133
A hundred and forty-five pounds.

269
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,802
In one year?

270
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,304
My God, what did she eat? Her family?

271
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,434
That's not the point.

272
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:03,604
I know it was a stupid reason
to break up with someone, but I was 15.

273
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:08,067
Yeah, well, that's not
the only time this was an issue.

274
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,530
You remember when you spent
Thanksgiving with us?

275
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,865
You called me fat.

276
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,199
Wait a minute.

277
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,119
- That was totally different.
- How?

278
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:22,081
You were not supposed to hear that.
I said that behind your back.

279
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,961
What if I have babies, okay?
I'm gonna look different.

280
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,630
I'm okay with that,
but I'm not sure you are.

281
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:33,092
You have to realize I don't think
of you as a thin, beautiful woman.

282
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:41,350
This is one of the things
that I can apologize for later.

283
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,438
What I mean is, you're Monica.

284
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,733
Okay? And I am in love with Monica.

285
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,485
Keep going.

286
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:54,864
So you can balloon up
or you can shrink down...

287
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,033
...and I will still love you.

288
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:02,121
Even if I shrink down to 2 inches tall?

289
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,916
I'd carry you around in my pocket.

290
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,460
I love you.

291
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:13,758
Skidmark still got a way with the ladies.

292
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,720
Hi, Pheebs.

293
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,347
- Hi.
- Hi.

294
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,390
I just want to apologize.

295
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,976
I'm really sorry I was a baby.

296
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,730
That's ridiculous.
Rachel, we were all babies once.

297
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,152
- Oh, you mean today.
- Yeah.

298
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,073
Yeah, and you know, you deserve to win.

299
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,866
And I was thinking about it.

300
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:42,411
If you're Monica's maid of honor,
I get to be yours.

301
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,123
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

302
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,128
When Monica and Chandler got engaged,
I put some stuff together.

303
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,506
- Just in case.
- Oh, that's so sweet. Thanks.

304
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,051
Here is a book of poetry
that I know Monica loves.

305
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,512
Oh, God, this is funny. Look.

306
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,182
Here's a picture from one Halloween
when she dressed up as a bride.

307
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,184
She made me carry her train...

308
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:08,604
...which was weird
because I was Wonder Woman.

309
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,025
Oh, and here's a little purse that I found.

310
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:16,070
I just thought they could hold
the rings in there.

311
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,948
- Oh.
- Something. And...

312
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:23,661
...vintage handkerchiefs, you know,
because people cry at weddings.

313
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,497
I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.

314
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,876
This stuff is great.

315
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,628
I forgot this was in here.

316
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,551
This was the garter
that I was saving for my wedding.

317
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:42,763
And I wanted it
to be Monica's "something borrowed."

318
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,432
And it's blue.

319
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,811
Yeah.

320
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,900
Rach, I think that you should be
Monica's maid of honor.

321
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,820
You do?

322
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,866
- Why?
- Because I think it means more to you.

323
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,827
But, Pheebs, honey, you earned it.

324
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,038
It's fine. I mean, this is something...

325
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:11,125
...that you've been thinking about
since you were, what, 14?

326
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,503
No, I was 10. I just developed early.

327
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,131
Man alive!

328
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,719
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey!

329
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,139
We decided Rachel is
going to be your maid of honor.

330
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,808
Oh, that's great!

331
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:31,270
Oh, wow. Okay, we really
have to start planning.

332
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,648
I have really specific ideas.

333
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,067
We should meet four times a week.

334
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,654
Come to my place,
we'll get together before work.

335
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:43,115
What do you say, 6:30, my place?
So excited!

336
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,334
Yeah, okay. You laugh now.

337
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,044
She's gonna be yours.

338
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,062
Great nap.

339
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,273
It really was.

340
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,459
Dude, what the hell are you doing?

341
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,254
God!

342
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,053
Excuse me.
