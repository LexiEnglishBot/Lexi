00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,585
Kids are tough.
Good luck with that. Pfft.

331
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,510
Look, I wanted to tell you,
I'm sorry you lost.

332
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:06,472
Oh, listen. I got a secret for you.
I let him win.

333
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,850
- Heh, heh.
- Was that a secret, or a lie?

334
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,353
- No, I let him... Ross?
- Yeah?

335
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,730
Would you tell her
I let you win, please?

336
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,150
Oh, yeah, uh, Chandler let me win.

337
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,156
No, Chandler's really strong.
Oh, my arm is so sore. Oh, nurse?

338
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,120
I am strong. I'll show you.

339
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,913
Chandler, please.

340
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,999
Oh, what's the matter? Are you scared?

341
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,584
Let's go, big bunny!

342
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,338
One, two, three. Go!

343
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,096
I'm gonna kill myself.
