1
00:00:10,756 --> 00:00:14,123
-What are you guys doing up?
-Finishing the crossword.

2
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:17,857
Do you know a six-letter
word for ''red''?

3
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:20,123
Dark red.

4
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:25,768
Wrong, but there's a connect-the-dots
in here for you later.

5
00:00:27,306 --> 00:00:29,137
Hey, how about maroon?

6
00:00:30,409 --> 00:00:32,639
Yes! You are so smart!

7
00:00:34,646 --> 00:00:35,977
You guys are so cute.

8
00:00:36,248 --> 00:00:37,237
l know.

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,142
See you in the morning.

10
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:57,063
l love doing crossword
puzzles with you.

11
00:00:57,235 --> 00:00:58,224
Me too.

12
00:00:58,403 --> 00:01:00,803
Now let's finish this
and go to bed.

13
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:02,570
Only one left.

14
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:06,277
Three-letter word.
Not dog, but....

15
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:08,741
Cat.

16
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:13,578
You are so smart!

17
00:01:16,154 --> 00:01:17,143
l love you.

18
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:18,821
l love you too.

19
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,901
The One with the Cop

20
00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:24,820
We still need a tip.

21
00:02:25,023 --> 00:02:27,457
All right. Hold on.

22
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:29,057
l got it.

23
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:31,019
Nickel.

24
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,532
-How much do we need?
-Couple of bucks.

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,292
Okay, dime.

26
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:40,528
You guys keep talking.
This could take a while.

27
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:41,966
Wait, look it!

28
00:02:43,742 --> 00:02:45,676
This is a police badge!

29
00:02:45,877 --> 00:02:49,904
Cool. But why would a cop come
in here? They don't serve doughnuts.

30
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,984
Could you discover the badge again?
l can do better than that.

31
00:02:57,255 --> 00:02:59,314
l bet somebody's
missing that badge.

32
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:02,822
l should take it back.
But at the police station...

33
00:03:03,061 --> 00:03:04,995
...l'll check their 1 0 Most Wanted List.

34
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,996
My friend's been number 1 1 forever.
This could be her year!

35
00:03:11,236 --> 00:03:13,898
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey, Joey.

36
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:18,775
ls that my sweatshirt?

37
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,343
Yes, it is. l'm sorry.
l was cold. l hope it's okay.

38
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:26,108
lt's just that if you wear
someone's sweatshirt...

39
00:03:26,384 --> 00:03:28,579
...shouldn't it be your boyfriend's?

40
00:03:28,854 --> 00:03:30,219
And l'm not him.

41
00:03:31,957 --> 00:03:33,925
l'm sorry.
l'll give it back.

42
00:03:34,693 --> 00:03:37,287
lt's gonna be all
smelling like Monica.

43
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,392
Do l smell bad?

44
00:03:40,465 --> 00:03:43,025
You smell like a meadow.

45
00:03:45,303 --> 00:03:46,292
l'm sorry.

46
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:50,632
What's with him?

47
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:55,243
The last time Joey went to a meadow
his mother was shot by a hunter.

48
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,514
Look what l found.
lt's a police badge.

49
00:04:01,686 --> 00:04:04,951
What's that doing here?
l don't see any doughnuts.

50
00:04:07,592 --> 00:04:09,787
Cops and doughnuts.
Come on.

51
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:12,756
lf Chandler had said it
you'd all be on the floor.

52
00:04:12,998 --> 00:04:15,398
Cops, doughnuts? Me?

53
00:04:33,218 --> 00:04:35,345
l still don't know.

54
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,456
l want to make sure l bought
the right couch, one that says...

55
00:04:39,691 --> 00:04:43,991
...''Kids welcome here,''
but that also says...

56
00:04:44,262 --> 00:04:45,695
...''Come here to me.''

57
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,601
What? You say that to kids?

58
00:04:53,772 --> 00:04:58,300
The ''Come here to me'' is,
you know, for the ladies.

59
00:04:59,177 --> 00:05:02,271
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch,
it's not a magic couch.

60
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:06,681
Well, you picked a great couch.

61
00:05:06,952 --> 00:05:08,510
-Sign here, please.
-Sure.

62
00:05:09,654 --> 00:05:13,647
The delivery charge
is almost as much as the couch!

63
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:16,861
That's ridiculous.
He lives three blocks away.

64
00:05:17,128 --> 00:05:19,961
l'll take it myself.
Thank you.

65
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:23,326
All right, Rach, come on.
Let's go.

66
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:30,838
Are you kidding?

67
00:05:31,676 --> 00:05:35,806
Come on. lt's only three blocks.
lt's not very heavy. Try it.

68
00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:43,052
Oh, l can do it.

69
00:05:43,488 --> 00:05:46,048
You two will really
enjoy that couch.

70
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:48,986
We're not together.

71
00:05:50,328 --> 00:05:53,024
Something didn't quite add up there.

72
00:05:59,938 --> 00:06:02,168
What's that supposed to mean?

73
00:06:02,674 --> 00:06:05,040
Well, you. Her.

74
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:07,040
l mean, she's very...

75
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,507
...you know.

76
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,111
And you're, like...

77
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:11,738
...you know?

78
00:06:14,953 --> 00:06:18,753
Not that it's any of your business,
but we did go out.

79
00:06:19,024 --> 00:06:21,356
Really? You two?

80
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:25,084
l don't want to do this now.
l'm carrying a heavy couch.

81
00:06:25,363 --> 00:06:27,627
Then tell him quickly.

82
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:30,063
Fine. We went out.

83
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:32,566
Not only did we go out...

84
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:35,704
...we did it 298 times!

85
00:06:39,911 --> 00:06:43,642
You kept count?
You are such a loser!

86
00:06:44,783 --> 00:06:48,651
A loser you did it with 298 times!

87
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,392
Excuse me, ma'am. You can't put
your cigarette out on a tree.

88
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:01,323
Yeah, l can.
lt worked well.

89
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:05,293
But you shouldn't.
So don't ever do that again.

90
00:07:05,503 --> 00:07:08,438
l won't. Till l have
my next cigarette.

91
00:07:08,673 --> 00:07:09,901
Hold it!

92
00:07:10,175 --> 00:07:12,075
N.Y.P.D. Freeze, punk!

93
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,173
That's right. You are so busted.

94
00:07:17,782 --> 00:07:18,840
Book them.

95
00:07:20,685 --> 00:07:23,677
-Who are you talking to?
-Save it, red!

96
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:27,924
Apologize to the tree or
spend the night in the slammer.

97
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:30,994
l am not apologizing to a tree.

98
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:35,191
You apologize to the tree right now
or l am calling for backup.

99
00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:38,829
Backup! Backup!

100
00:07:39,137 --> 00:07:40,764
l'm sorry! Sorry!

101
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:44,032
Okay, cancel backup!
Cancel backup!

102
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:50,141
Didn't you say there was
an elevator in here?

103
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:53,112
Yes, l did, but there isn't.
Here we go!

104
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:57,586
Don't you think we should rethink
the whole hiring movers thing?

105
00:07:57,756 --> 00:07:59,451
No way. They're a rip-off.

106
00:07:59,624 --> 00:08:03,321
They check out your stuff
and come back later and steal it.

107
00:08:03,495 --> 00:08:06,760
lt's true. l saw it on <i>Dateline.</i>

108
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:09,729
Jane Pauley is the one woman
l would kiss.

109
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:14,829
-There's just something about her.
-Rach, can we concentrate?

110
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,369
Yeah, fine.
l listened to your dumb story.

111
00:08:19,544 --> 00:08:21,307
Okay, go left.

112
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:23,138
Left. Left.

113
00:08:23,448 --> 00:08:27,145
Okay, you know what?
There's no more left left.

114
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:30,051
Lift it straight up over your head.

115
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:32,483
Straight up. You can do it!

116
00:08:32,757 --> 00:08:34,054
You can do it!

117
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:35,817
Okay. You got it?

118
00:08:36,094 --> 00:08:37,584
-Go, go.
-Good, good.

119
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:40,889
You got it, right?
You got it, right? You got--

120
00:08:45,737 --> 00:08:48,570
Any chance you think
it looks good there?

121
00:08:50,341 --> 00:08:51,603
This guy was all:

122
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:54,972
And l'm all,
''Buffay! Homicide!''

123
00:08:56,781 --> 00:08:58,442
lt was just so cool!

124
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:03,750
-You were supposed to take it back.
-l'm having fun doing good deeds.

125
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:07,588
You can get arrested
for impersonating a police officer.

126
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,286
You could get arrested
right now!

127
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:16,825
l'd better take it back.
l'm totally drunk with power.

128
00:09:27,345 --> 00:09:30,337
Yeah. l didn't know
you guys would be here.

129
00:09:30,548 --> 00:09:33,176
-Do me a favor. Taste this.
-What? Why?

130
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:36,746
lt's okay, Joe, she's a trained chef.

131
00:09:37,622 --> 00:09:41,114
Actually, l was looking for Phoebe.

132
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,020
Well, you just missed her.

133
00:09:45,463 --> 00:09:46,521
Was that her?

134
00:09:47,065 --> 00:09:49,295
-l gotta go.
-Joey, wait a minute. Wait.

135
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:51,901
-What is with you?
-Nothing.

136
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,731
You're acting strange.

137
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:57,298
All right. There is something.

138
00:09:58,109 --> 00:10:00,475
l kind of had a dream.

139
00:10:01,346 --> 00:10:03,576
But l don't want to talk about it.

140
00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:06,679
What if Martin Luther King
had said that?

141
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:10,944
l kind of have a dream.

142
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:14,082
l don't want to talk about it.

143
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,158
Look, it involved Monica.

144
00:10:18,363 --> 00:10:21,161
You had a dream about the girl l'm seeing?
Cool.

145
00:10:21,432 --> 00:10:23,627
l dreamt about the girls he was seeing.

146
00:10:23,868 --> 00:10:27,133
Let's talk about your dream.
l love you. Your dream?

147
00:10:27,972 --> 00:10:31,100
There was no sex.
l haven't dreamt of her like that...

148
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:34,004
...since l found out
about you two. More or less.

149
00:10:38,816 --> 00:10:40,875
What was the dream about?

150
00:10:43,188 --> 00:10:46,783
You were my girlfriend.
We were doing the crossword puzzle.

151
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:48,822
Like you did last night.

152
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,223
That's it. l'm in love
with Monica. l'll move out.

153
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,193
Joey, come on. That doesn't mean
you're in love with me.

154
00:10:56,968 --> 00:10:57,992
lt doesn't?

155
00:10:58,203 --> 00:10:59,898
lt could mean anything.
Like...

156
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:03,572
...you're jealous that l've become
the apartment stud.

157
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:06,204
Sounds like your dream.

158
00:11:08,913 --> 00:11:13,873
Or it could mean you saw Chandler
and me being close and stuff...

159
00:11:14,152 --> 00:11:15,915
...and you want that too.

160
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:19,051
ln the dream
l did enjoy the closeness.

161
00:11:20,258 --> 00:11:23,887
lf that's what it was, that'd be great.
l wouldn't have to move.

162
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:26,420
Are you attracted to Monica?

163
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:30,361
Right here, right now,
are you attracted to her?

164
00:11:32,604 --> 00:11:34,629
-Not really.
-There you have it!

165
00:11:34,906 --> 00:11:38,307
Well, sure!
l'm just wearing sweats!

166
00:11:39,777 --> 00:11:40,903
But that's good!

167
00:11:41,112 --> 00:11:44,240
You're not in love with me.
You just want a girlfriend.

168
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:47,043
lt's not just about
getting a girlfriend.

169
00:11:47,285 --> 00:11:51,881
l could get a girlfriend.
We could sit and do crossword puzzles.

170
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,957
But could we have
the closeness like you have?

171
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,419
Monica and l were friends
before we dated. Maybe that's it.

172
00:11:59,664 --> 00:12:01,632
Friends first?

173
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,391
That's interesting.

174
00:12:04,602 --> 00:12:08,299
-You become friends after?
-No, never done that either.

175
00:12:09,574 --> 00:12:11,804
Do you guys have a tape measure?

176
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,342
Yeah. lt's actually in my bedroom.

177
00:12:15,813 --> 00:12:17,246
That's right.

178
00:12:30,194 --> 00:12:31,752
What's up, Joey?

179
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:36,092
How you doing?

180
00:12:44,642 --> 00:12:47,110
Excuse me. ls this your car?

181
00:12:47,378 --> 00:12:50,506
Don't park here.
You're blocking the entrance.

182
00:12:50,782 --> 00:12:52,682
Don't worry.
lt's not a problem.

183
00:12:52,884 --> 00:12:57,787
lt's a problem for me, so it's a
problem for you, because l'm a cop.

184
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:01,523
So am l.

185
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:10,827
Okay. So you're a cop.
You can park anywhere.

186
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:13,026
l know, because l'm a cop too.

187
00:13:13,338 --> 00:13:15,670
Keep up the good work. 1 0-4.

188
00:13:15,907 --> 00:13:18,671
Wait. So, what precinct are you with?

189
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,405
l'm with the 57th.

190
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,978
-l know a guy in Homicide up there.
-l'm in Vice.

191
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:28,674
ln fact, l'm undercover
right now. l'm a whore.

192
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:32,750
Who else is in Vice there?

193
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:34,753
Do you know...

194
00:13:35,026 --> 00:13:36,220
...Sipowicz?

195
00:13:37,095 --> 00:13:39,086
Sipowicz? l don't think so.

196
00:13:39,364 --> 00:13:42,424
Yeah. Sipowicz. Yeah.
Big guy, kind of bald.

197
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:44,732
l don't know him.

198
00:13:45,937 --> 00:13:49,236
Don't try to call him.
He's not there. He's out.

199
00:13:49,507 --> 00:13:52,032
His partner just died.

200
00:13:53,244 --> 00:13:56,008
Tell Sipowicz l'm real sorry
for his loss.

201
00:13:56,214 --> 00:13:58,705
l sure will. Take care.

202
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,544
By the way, l'm sure
Sipowicz will be all right.

203
00:14:01,786 --> 00:14:04,687
l heard that kid from <i>Silver Spoons</i>
is really good.

204
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,522
Where'd you find my badge?

205
00:14:20,104 --> 00:14:23,596
Could you give me and Ross
a hand moving his couch?

206
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:27,267
l'd love to, but l got acting class.
But you know what?

207
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:30,608
l guess l could blow that off.
For you.

208
00:14:35,887 --> 00:14:40,221
Let me ask you something.
l was talking with Monica and Chandler.

209
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:42,325
Boy, they are really tight.

210
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,549
l know.

211
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:46,662
That's not a bad situation
they got there.

212
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:50,166
Think l'll get me one of those.

213
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:54,803
What's up, Joe?

214
00:14:55,573 --> 00:14:58,736
l think Monica and Chandler
are so great...

215
00:14:58,943 --> 00:15:01,503
...because they were friends first.

216
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:06,079
So l asked myself, who are my friends?
You and Phoebe.

217
00:15:06,317 --> 00:15:08,615
l saw you first, so....

218
00:15:11,756 --> 00:15:16,250
-What are you saying?
-Maybe you and l crank it up a notch.

219
00:15:20,131 --> 00:15:21,689
You know, honey...

220
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:24,264
...as flattered as l am...

221
00:15:24,502 --> 00:15:27,130
...that you saw me first...

222
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:31,705
...l just don't think we should be
cranking anything up.

223
00:15:33,177 --> 00:15:35,475
l'll treat you real nice.

224
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:43,650
Yeah. Well, you know....

225
00:15:45,523 --> 00:15:50,483
l think it's a great idea to become
friends with someone before you date.

226
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:54,856
But the way you do it is you
meet someone, become their friend...

227
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:58,524
...build a foundation,
then ask them out on a date.

228
00:15:58,803 --> 00:16:01,237
Don't hit on your existing friends.

229
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,508
Won't that take longer?

230
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:10,079
Oh, but once you find it...

231
00:16:10,348 --> 00:16:12,407
...it's so worth the wait.

232
00:16:14,652 --> 00:16:15,846
l understand.

233
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:17,077
Good.

234
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:20,649
Man, l wish l saw Phoebe first.

235
00:16:24,262 --> 00:16:25,388
Come here to me.

236
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:29,696
No, no. You come here to me.

237
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,267
-l brought reinforcements.
-Great! You brought Joey?

238
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:37,906
The next best thing.

239
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:44,212
You brought Chandler?
The next best thing would be Monica!

240
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:49,251
l would be offended, but Monica
is freakishly strong, so....

241
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:52,389
l drew a sketch
of how we'll do it.

242
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,524
Rach, that's you.

243
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:56,784
That's the couch.

244
00:16:57,628 --> 00:16:59,027
What's that?

245
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:00,753
That's me.

246
00:17:05,102 --> 00:17:07,400
Certainly think a lot of yourself.

247
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,074
No. That's my arm.

248
00:17:15,313 --> 00:17:19,545
l see. l thought you just really,
really liked your new couch.

249
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,315
Just follow my lead.

250
00:17:26,924 --> 00:17:28,721
Come on, Chandler.

251
00:17:30,227 --> 00:17:31,558
-All right.
-Okay.

252
00:17:31,796 --> 00:17:33,263
Here we go.

253
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:36,495
All right. Ready?

254
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:37,958
Turn!

255
00:17:38,202 --> 00:17:39,191
Turn!

256
00:17:39,403 --> 00:17:40,495
Turn!

257
00:17:41,672 --> 00:17:45,802
-l don't think we can turn any more!
-l don't think it'll fit!

258
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,444
Yeah, it will.
Come on! Up, up, up!

259
00:17:49,313 --> 00:17:51,247
Up! Yes!

260
00:17:51,782 --> 00:17:53,113
Here we go! Pivot!

261
00:17:54,452 --> 00:17:55,510
Pivot!

262
00:17:57,288 --> 00:17:58,346
Pivot!

263
00:17:59,323 --> 00:18:00,312
Pivot!

264
00:18:02,193 --> 00:18:03,319
Pivot!

265
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:05,584
Pivot!

266
00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:08,526
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

267
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,304
l don't think it'll pivot any more.

268
00:18:15,606 --> 00:18:16,937
You think?

269
00:18:19,276 --> 00:18:23,042
All right, let's bring it
back down and try again.

270
00:18:31,122 --> 00:18:33,613
l think it's really stuck now.

271
00:18:35,226 --> 00:18:38,718
-l can't believe that didn't work.
-l know. Me neither.

272
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,657
l mean, you had a sketch.

273
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:45,201
What did you mean when
you said ''pivot''?

274
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:53,801
Man, l cannot figure this out.

275
00:18:54,612 --> 00:18:57,979
Yeah, because it's not 1 985.

276
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,608
You guys, guess what?
l ditched a cop.

277
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,180
-What?
-What do you mean?

278
00:19:04,388 --> 00:19:07,118
He caught me using his badge
and he tried to bust me.

279
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,759
Damn real cops!

280
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:11,458
How far did he chase you?

281
00:19:11,629 --> 00:19:15,429
Well, he didn't really. He just picked up
his badge and stood there.

282
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,796
Maybe we'll see you on
<i>World's Most Boring Police Chases.</i>

283
00:19:20,838 --> 00:19:23,602
-Why did you run?
-l had to.

284
00:19:23,774 --> 00:19:27,266
You know, impersonating a cop
is like a Class E felony.

285
00:19:27,445 --> 00:19:30,710
Two to four years minimum.
l am not going back to that hellhole.

286
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:37,719
lf l can just get it to pivot...

287
00:19:37,888 --> 00:19:39,981
...we'll be back on track.

288
00:19:41,392 --> 00:19:46,091
-Rach, can l get some help please?
-Yeah.

289
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:50,693
Turn it off! Turn it off!

290
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,438
Maybe the firemen can help us
move the couch when they get here.

291
00:19:57,241 --> 00:20:01,371
-Wait, wait, wait.
-lt's a new couch! lt's a new couch!

292
00:20:08,953 --> 00:20:11,547
How's it going?
Make any new friends?

293
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:13,814
Yeah.
l met this woman.

294
00:20:16,393 --> 00:20:18,054
What's she like?

295
00:20:18,262 --> 00:20:19,752
Well, she's...

296
00:20:19,997 --> 00:20:21,396
...really good in bed.

297
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:27,467
-You were going to be friends first.
-Hey, it's all your fault.

298
00:20:27,638 --> 00:20:28,627
Why?

299
00:20:28,806 --> 00:20:31,775
You didn't give me advice.
You gave me a pickup line.

300
00:20:31,976 --> 00:20:35,810
l told her l wanted to build a foundation
and be friends first.

301
00:20:36,013 --> 00:20:40,814
Suddenly, through no fault of my own,
l became irresistible to her!

302
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,147
And her roommate.

303
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:47,017
What about the closeness?

304
00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:51,825
Closeness, schmosness. There was
three of us, for crying out loud!

305
00:20:56,534 --> 00:20:58,092
Who wants pizza?

306
00:20:58,335 --> 00:20:59,768
l do! l do! l do!

307
00:21:00,504 --> 00:21:04,338
This is great! Can you believe
l found it on the second floor?

308
00:21:07,311 --> 00:21:09,279
-Who is it?
-N.Y.P.D.

309
00:21:09,513 --> 00:21:10,502
Oh, my God!

310
00:21:11,949 --> 00:21:13,541
Just a minute, officer!

311
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,694
-l'm looking for Phoebe Buffay.
-My God, it's him! lt's that cop!

312
00:21:27,965 --> 00:21:31,867
-l can't believe he found me!
-Are you gonna go to jail?

313
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:35,236
lf l go down,
you guys go down with me.

314
00:21:37,374 --> 00:21:40,832
Harboring a fugitive?
That's one to three years minimum.

315
00:21:41,245 --> 00:21:43,145
Good luck, Chandler.

316
00:21:46,584 --> 00:21:50,486
Arrest me, but you'll never
make it stick and you know it.

317
00:21:50,754 --> 00:21:54,053
l have no choice, it's my job.
You understand, right?

318
00:21:54,258 --> 00:21:57,091
And you understand that
l'm calling my lawyer.

319
00:21:57,328 --> 00:22:01,162
And once he puts you on the stand,
he'll make you look like a fool!

320
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:04,898
l don't like looking foolish.

321
00:22:05,502 --> 00:22:09,529
Maybe l don't arrest you today.
Maybe l came by and you weren't here.

322
00:22:09,773 --> 00:22:11,934
l'd love it if l weren't here!

323
00:22:12,743 --> 00:22:16,736
Since you're not going to jail tonight,
l was wondering if you'd...

324
00:22:17,014 --> 00:22:19,175
...like to go to dinner with me?

325
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:20,906
Me?

326
00:22:21,352 --> 00:22:25,186
Ever since you flashed my badge
l can't stop thinking about you.

327
00:22:25,456 --> 00:22:29,256
You're the prettiest fake
undercover whore l've ever seen.

328
00:22:30,861 --> 00:22:32,055
Nice.

329
00:22:34,865 --> 00:22:38,301
l didn't see that coming.
You're asking me out.

330
00:22:38,535 --> 00:22:41,971
l could've done it better,
but these people keep staring at me.

331
00:22:42,806 --> 00:22:46,298
l'd like to go out
with you, officer.

332
00:22:47,211 --> 00:22:48,940
-Gary.
-Gary.

333
00:22:49,213 --> 00:22:51,113
Okay, so it's a date.

334
00:22:51,382 --> 00:22:53,942
l gotta ask you, though.
How'd you find me?

335
00:22:54,218 --> 00:22:57,119
l ran your fingerprints
through the computer.

336
00:22:57,388 --> 00:23:00,084
This was listed
as your last known address.

337
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,315
lmpressive.

338
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:05,892
Not as impressive as you. Your record
shows you've done some weird stuff.

339
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,722
We'll talk at dinner.

340
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:12,994
-So l'll come by and pick you up?
-l can't wait.

341
00:23:13,304 --> 00:23:16,137
Don't worry, l won't just
take you out for doughnuts.

342
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,841
He has a gun!

343
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:30,413
l'd like to return this couch.
