1
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,049
What's so funny?

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:13,345
Oh, nothing. It's an acting exercise.
I'm practicing my fake laugh.

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,264
Oh.

4
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,394
What? What's so funny?

5
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,064
Oh, no, no.

6
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,608
No, no. There's none of that in here.

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,112
Oh, come on.
At least let me finish this last one.

8
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,073
Okay, but only if you give me a drag.

9
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,784
Okay.

10
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,127
Oh, dark mother, once again
I suckle at your smoky teat.

11
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,382
Why don't you hold on to that one.

12
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,936
That's, like, the least fun game ever.

13
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,023
I'm sick of your smoking,
so I brought something...

14
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,525
...that is going to help you quit.

15
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,152
Oh.

16
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,992
That patch is no good.

17
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,915
It's a hypnosis tape.

18
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,877
A woman at work used it for two weeks
and hasn't smoked since.

19
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,462
Ha!

20
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,423
What's your problem?

21
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,511
Nothing. It's just that
hypnosis is beyond crap.

22
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,515
I watched you get hypnotized
in Atlantic City.

23
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,184
That guy did not hypnotize me, okay?

24
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:46,355
You always pull your pants down
and play "Wipe Out" on your butt.

25
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,608
Forget hypnosis.

26
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:53,570
The way to quit smoking is
to dance naked in a field of heather...

27
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,907
...and then bathe in the sweat
of six healthy young men.

28
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:01,245
Or what my father calls
"Thursday night."

29
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,505
- Here you go.
- I didn't want cinnamon on this.

30
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,132
Sorry.

31
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,142
- Hi. Hi.
- Oh, my God! Frank!

32
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,853
Ha, ha. Hi. How are you?

33
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,771
What are you doing here?

34
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,649
I would've called,
but I lost your number.

35
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,778
And then, uh, my mom locked me out
of the house, so I couldn't find it.

36
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:21,950
And, uh, then I tried to find a pay phone,
and the receiver was cut off.

37
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,703
What happened?

38
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,831
Uh, oh. Vandalism.

39
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,793
But also, what happened
between you and your mom?

40
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:36,506
We got in a fight. She said that
I was too immature to get married.

41
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,051
- You're getting married?
- Oh, yeah.

42
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,844
Aah!

43
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,640
My little brother's getting married! Ha, ha.

44
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:49,061
I knew you'd be so cool about this.
Uh, hey, do you wanna meet her?

45
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,479
Do I?

46
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,147
Do you?

47
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,191
Yeah, I do.

48
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,778
Cool, all right.
She's just parking the truck.

49
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,657
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go get
my, uh, fiancée, man!

50
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,789
I'd have bet good money that he'd be
the first one of us to get married.

51
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,791
Isn't it fantastic?

52
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,253
Yeah, but don't you think he's
a little young to get married?

53
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,172
- What? He's 18.
- It'll be illegal for him to drink...

54
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,132
...at his own bachelor party.

55
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,177
Yeah, or to get a hooker.

56
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,222
Always illegal, Joe.

57
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,349
Hey! Hey!

58
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,310
This is, uh, my fiancée...

59
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,479
...Mrs. Knight.
- Ha-ha-ha.

60
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,317
- That's my sister.
- You know, it's funny.

61
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:41,697
Frank told me so much about you,
but you're not how I pictured you at all.

62
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,700
Yeah, I'm a big surprise.

63
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,995
- Here you go. Here, grab a seat.
- Oh.

64
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,706
So how did you guys meet?

65
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,583
Well, um, I was in Mrs. Knight's...

66
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,754
I mean, Alice. Sorry.
I always do that. Ha, ha.

67
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,758
I was in her Home Ec class.

68
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,427
He was my best student.

69
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,595
She was my best teacher.

70
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,222
Aww.

71
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,358
If that doesn't keep kids in school,
what will?

72
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,405
And so now you guys
are gonna be married?

73
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,740
Yeah. Ha, ha.

74
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:28,910
We talked about just living together,
but, um...

75
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,122
...we wanna have kids right away.

76
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,376
Oh, my God!

77
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,462
Great!

78
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,175
Wow, kids. Frank,
are you sure you're ready for that?

79
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,302
How hard can it be?

80
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,806
You know, I mean, you know, babies.
Who doesn't want babies? Right?

81
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,435
And besides,
I never had a dad around.

82
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:57,105
And now I always will,
because it'll be me.

83
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,988
Really, we do realize that there's
an age difference between us.

84
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,824
Good. Because you were
acting like you didn't.

85
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:11,328
But when it comes to love,
what does age matter?

86
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,546
You are falling fast asleep.

87
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,758
Deeper, deeper, deeper.

88
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,386
You are now completely asleep.

89
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,888
You don't need to smoke.

90
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,641
Cigarettes don't control you.

91
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,894
You are a strong, confident woman...

92
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,897
...who does not need to smoke.

93
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,317
A strong, confident woman.

94
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,324
You know what? I realized in the last year
I've only gone out with Richard and Julio.

95
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,120
You gotta help me out. Set me up.
Get me back in the game.

96
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:57,374
Shouldn't be a problem. I work in fashion,
and all I meet are eligible straight men.

97
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,712
Can I get you something else?

98
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,757
Cheesecake and a date,
if you're giving them out.

99
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,218
Heh. Haven't we covered that topic?

100
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,930
- You just said to her...
- You wanna go out with me...

101
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,475
...because of my wig, the big boobs,
and I serve you food.

102
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,228
If that were true,
I'd be dating my Aunt Ruth.

103
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,315
And the two times we went out,
it was plain awkward.

104
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,111
You think she should go out with me,
don't you?

105
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,487
Ha, ha.

106
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,574
Well, I mean...

107
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,868
...are you sure
you wanna go out with her?

108
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:36,580
That ain't a pretty picture
in the morning, know what I mean?

109
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:40,792
That wig all in disarray,
and boobs flung over the nightstand.

110
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,753
Really. Think about it.

111
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,631
Oh, I will. Ha-ha-ha.

112
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,178
No, I know.
I know that this is Frank's life.

113
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,762
You know?

114
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,391
I don't wanna be judgmental,
but it's sick. It's sick and wrong!

115
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,769
What, is it the age thing?

116
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,730
No, I'm fine with the age thing...

117
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,733
...until it sticks its tongue
down my brother's throat.

118
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,904
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.

119
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,241
You think he'll enjoy it
when he's up to his elbows in diapers...

120
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,494
...of all the babies
they have to have right away?

121
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:21,291
This is not fair to Frank,
and it's not fair to the babies.

122
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,127
You know what?
It's not good home economics.

123
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,798
Have you told him how you feel?

124
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,676
Yes. Not out loud.

125
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:36,932
If you don't tell him, soon he'll be
married, then you'll hate yourself.

126
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,769
Yeah, but if I do tell him,
then he's gonna hate myself.

127
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,272
Look at him and his mom.
I can't.

128
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,777
But you guys can.
You talk him out of it.

129
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,862
No, no, no, no, no, no.

130
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,948
Come on, you guys.

131
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,536
You have nothing to lose.
I have everything to lose.

132
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,163
Do you want me to lose everything?
Everything?

133
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,709
No.

134
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,504
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.

135
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:13,468
We're walking down the street,
and I turn to you and say:

136
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,930
"Let's go hang out at
Totally Nude Nudes." Remember?

137
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,725
And then, heh, you say,
"Let's just hang out at your place."

138
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,353
Well, that was a nice move, dumb-ass.

139
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,357
I think you should
go out with this guy.

140
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,401
No, he doesn't do anything for me.

141
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,905
Last Saturday night, what happened
on Walker, Texas Ranger?

142
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:38,785
Well, um, Walker was looking
for this big busload of kids. Heh.

143
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,996
All right, I get your point.

144
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,540
- Hey.
- Hey.

145
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,710
I forgot the combination to this
about a year ago.

146
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,004
I just carry it around.

147
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,133
- You got any Chap Stick?
- Uh, yeah.

148
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,010
Hey, how are those tapes working out?

149
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,637
Pretty good. Good.
I haven't smoked yet today.

150
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:02,267
I feel great and confident.
That is a stunning blouse.

151
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,188
Thank you.

152
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,024
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

153
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:14,154
Okay, Mon. Let's give Pete a chance.
He was funny. He seems really nice.

154
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,239
That check thing was adorable.

155
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,074
What check thing?

156
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:23,455
As a joke, this customer who has a
crush on me, gave me a $20,000 tip.

157
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,374
His number's on the check.
He did it so I'd call.

158
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,877
Pete Becker. Pete...

159
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,635
Is this him?

160
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,428
That's Bill Clinton.

161
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,557
Who's he hugging?

162
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,937
Oh, my God. That's Pete.
Why is Bill hugging Pete?

163
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,898
This guy invented Moss 865.

164
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,525
Every office in the world
uses that program.

165
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,236
- We use it!
- There you go!

166
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,823
Oh, my God. Monica's gonna go out
with a millionaire.

167
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,493
- No, I'm not gonna go out with him.
- Oh, my God.

168
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,580
I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check.
This is so exciting.

169
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,999
Or incredibly offensive.

170
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,626
Yeah, sure. That too.

171
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,099
What?

172
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,561
All we're saying is,
don't rush into anything.

173
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:33,108
Come on, think about it.
You're 18, okay? She's 44.

174
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,736
When you're 36, she's gonna be 88.

175
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,240
You don't think I know that?

176
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,286
Look, the point is...

177
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,456
...there's a lot of women
you haven't had sex with yet.

178
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:52,419
Yeah, he's right. He's right.
This is your time, you know?

179
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:56,506
You're young. You're weird.
Chicks dig that.

180
00:11:56,674 --> 00:12:01,052
But isn't sex better when it's with
one person that you really care about?

181
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,638
Yeah, in a poem, maybe.

182
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:08,226
No, the man's right.
That's what I had with Rachel.

183
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,769
You don't have it anymore?

184
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:14,107
No, I, uh... I slept with someone else.

185
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,444
So wait. So how did that
make things better?

186
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,488
It didn't.

187
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,535
What you used to have with Rachel
is what I got with Alice.

188
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,412
Now what is that like?

189
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,788
It's so cool, man.

190
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:33,543
It's because being with her is so
much better than not being with her.

191
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,128
Yeah. Yeah.

192
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,298
- Why can't I find that?
- I had it and I blew it.

193
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,050
- Well, I want it!
- You can have it.

194
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,762
Maybe I can't.
Maybe there's something wrong with me.

195
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:48,224
No, it's out there, man.
I've seen it! I got it!

196
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,519
- Then you hold on to it!
- All right, man!

197
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,522
All right! Congratulations,
you lucky bastard!

198
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,816
You're Frank's best man?

199
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,946
I couldn't help it.
Their love is so pure.

200
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,158
What about you, huh?

201
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,118
I'm the ring bearer.

202
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,387
Hi! Oh, Alice, hi. Thanks.

203
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:30,183
I'm so glad you could come.
I've got a real, um, Home Ec emergency.

204
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,520
- Oh, my God. Who died on this?
- Yeah, I know.

205
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,522
It's a real "mustard-tastrophe."

206
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,317
- Can you help me?
- Absolutely.

207
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,445
Okay, first, we'll start
with a little club soda and salt.

208
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,740
- Then if that doesn't work...
- You know what? Forget it. It's ruined.

209
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,619
Oh, no, never say that. If you can't
get it out, cut around the stain...

210
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,455
...add a little lace,
you make a stylish throw.

211
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,544
Or instead, maybe you could just
not marry my brother, Frank?

212
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,468
Can we make it smaller?
Make it fit on the head of a pin?

213
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,929
I love when we make things
fit on the head of a pin.

214
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,305
- Got it, yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

215
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,684
You have Monica Geller here.

216
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,770
Uh, absolutely. Yeah, send her in.

217
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,564
Hi.

218
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,275
What the hell is this?

219
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,361
Hang on for a sec.
I'll talk to you in the morning?

220
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,571
You got it.

221
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,825
- I'm sorry. What?
- What's this supposed to mean?

222
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,245
Well, you know,
I never know how much to tip.

223
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:37,375
You double the tax.
Not double the tax of Romania.

224
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,129
I mean, what's the deal?
Are you trying to buy me?

225
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,381
Is this the way you get girls
to go out with you?

226
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,800
Uh, I'm still here.

227
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,140
You're taking this wrong.
If I didn't leave you that tip...

228
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,476
...you wouldn't have come,
we wouldn't have this argument...

229
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,979
...and there wouldn't be this,
uh, heat between us.

230
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,814
- What?
- Come on.

231
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,818
You gotta admit that our relationship
is hitting a new level now.

232
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,487
You were the chef,
and I was the customer.

233
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,907
But now we're this couple that fights.

234
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,492
Okay, um...

235
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,952
...you're a loon.

236
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,916
Look, forget the check, okay?
I like you.

237
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,126
I think you're great.

238
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,420
Come on, what do you say?

239
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,341
I don't know.

240
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,842
Why not?

241
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,304
I don't wanna encourage this behavior.

242
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,351
One meal.
That's all I'm asking for. Please?

243
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,478
We go out, we eat.

244
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:42,273
If you don't have a good time,
I'll give you 10 grand, we're even.

245
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,078
- Hi.
- Aah! No!

246
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:58,247
Wait, no. Just put the mail down.
It's me.

247
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,835
Sorry. Why were you just all in the dark?

248
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:08,174
Well, um, your laundry smelled so good
that I thought I'd curl up in it.

249
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,385
- Is that all right?
- Yeah, sure.

250
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,178
So how was your day?

251
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:16,140
It's just probably the worst one
since I've been alive.

252
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,395
What, um...? What happened?

253
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,772
Um, Alice, uh...

254
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,191
She, uh, called it off.

255
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,901
Oh, no.

256
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,572
Did, um... Did she say why?

257
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,575
Uh, no, not really.
Just that I was too young.

258
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,578
I don't see how I could
suddenly be too young...

259
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:41,207
...because I'm older than I was
when we first got together.

260
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,211
Yeah, yeah, no, I don't...

261
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:50,216
I don't know. But you know what?
Maybe it's just all for the best.

262
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,970
Well, yeah, if the best is
like unbelievable pain.

263
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,264
Oh, sweetie.

264
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,726
You know, I was just finally happy.

265
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,603
For the first time in my life...

266
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,231
...after my dad left me...

267
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:10,570
...and then getting arrested
for stealing those birds...

268
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:14,532
...and then the whole
punctured-lung thing.

269
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,328
It's still really hard to take
deep breaths in cold weather...

270
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:23,458
...but with Alice,
all that stuff kind of went away.

271
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:29,130
And now it's gone,
and I don't know why.

272
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:35,094
Ugh. Well, I can tell you why.
It's because of me.

273
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:39,474
But you know what? I only did it
because I love you, okay?

274
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:46,355
- What?
- Um, I kind of had a little chat with Alice...

275
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,734
...and I sort of made her see
why you two shouldn't be together.

276
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,237
And you'll see it too, one day.
You really, really will.

277
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,948
Wait a minute.
This is because of you?

278
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,158
Okay...

279
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,495
Wait, no. My mother didn't want us
to be together...

280
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,581
...but the worst thing she did
was tie me to the porch.

281
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,792
Okay, but...

282
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:09,545
I came to you because
I thought you'd understand.

283
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,006
Oh, no!

284
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,467
No... Ugh.

285
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,803
I would storm out of here...

286
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,807
...if I had some money
or a place to go.

287
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,023
Oh, my God! The millionaire's here!

288
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,234
Oh, my God!

289
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,533
Guys, please.
I'm just gonna have dinner with him.

290
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,496
Okay, just because he buys you dinner
does not mean you owe him anything.

291
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,124
I know.

292
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,961
Okay, then get the lobster.

293
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,841
- Hey.
- Hi.

294
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,217
- Hi.
- Hey.

295
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,593
Hello.

296
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,013
Hey, how much cash you got
in your pocket right now?

297
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,603
And that's why I'm not
inviting you in for a drink. Bye.

298
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,814
Why not? Hey, come in for drink.

299
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,401
- Where do you wanna go?
- You like pizza?

300
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:17,029
- Oh, that sounds great.
- I know a great little place.

301
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,246
You're not paying for the pizza.

302
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,958
Come on, it's only fair.
You paid for the flight.

303
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,710
Is that enough lira?

304
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,212
Uh, I'd throw another 1000 on that.

305
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,299
- How much is that?
- That's about 60 cents.

306
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,937
Every night!

307
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,025
You don't need to smoke.

308
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,694
Cigarettes don't control you.

309
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,531
You are a strong, confident woman...

310
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,492
...who does not need to smoke.

311
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,954
A strong, confident woman...

312
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:10,333
...who does not need to smoke.

313
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,127
So can I.

314
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,760
Hey, Frank.

315
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,806
Look, I know that you think I did
this totally evil thing.

316
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,433
But I so didn't.

317
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,646
Someone's here who can explain this
better than I can.

318
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,690
We can go look.

319
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,319
Hi, Frank.

320
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:45,284
Hi, Mrs. Knight.

321
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,789
Phoebe's right, Frank.

322
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,335
It's hard to hear, but it would've
been wrong to go through with it.

323
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,254
I was being selfish.

324
00:20:56,421 --> 00:21:00,299
Even though we want
the same things right now...

325
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,344
...in the future, we may not.

326
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,014
- Is that what it is?
- Yes, but not just that.

327
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,308
Right, not just that.

328
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:17,525
Even though we love each other
as much as we do...

329
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,652
...nonetheless...

330
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,864
- Nonetheless.
- Nonetheless.

331
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,702
Um...

332
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,205
You're too young...

333
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:35,042
...to really know what you want.

334
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,211
That's right, exactly.

335
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,674
That's a goodbye kiss.
That's good.

336
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,386
Bye-bye.

337
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:50,850
The important thing is,
is that you see what I'm saying.

338
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,728
This is clearly wrong.

339
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,773
I've decided I'm gonna
let this happen.

340
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,860
Okay, can I just get my purse?

341
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,654
- Mmm.
- Okay, all right, good.

342
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,120
Cigarettes don't control you.

343
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:14,373
You are a strong, confident woman...

344
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,418
...who does not need to smoke.

345
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,840
Joey's your best friend.

346
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:27,553
You wanna make him
a cheese sandwich every day.

347
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:35,061
And you also wanna buy him
hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
