1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:03,836
Come on, Joey!

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,380
Rach, I told you everything I knew
last night.

3
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:10,300
It's not that big a deal.
So Monica and Chandler are doing it.

4
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:13,137
I cannot believe you would say that!

5
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:17,057
Sorry. Monica and Chandler
are "making love."

6
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:21,854
No, I mean, come on.
This is a huge deal!

7
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:25,065
I need more details.
Who initiated the first kiss?

8
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,484
I don't know.

9
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,404
Is he romantic with her?

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,698
I don't know.

11
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,200
Are they in love?

12
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,037
- I don't know.
- Ugh.

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,330
You don't know anything.

14
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,249
- Oh! I know one thing.
- What?

15
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,710
They did it right there on the couch.

16
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,263
- Hey, Ross.
- Yeah.

17
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,225
Gunther, could I have a scone, please?

18
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,976
Want to hear some good news?

19
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,770
Someone I know is getting married.

20
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,982
Yeah, weddings are happy occasions.
Oh, by the by, it's my ex-wife, Emily!

21
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,985
Sorry, man.

22
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,863
- Here's your scone.
- Thanks, Gunther.

23
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,448
Thanks.

24
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,535
Stupid British snack food!

25
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,872
Did they teach you that
in anger management?

26
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,377
You know what might help deal with it?
Think of it this way.

27
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:12,005
You and Emily are in the past.
You can't be mad about the past.

28
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:16,009
Are you still mad about, you know,
the Louisiana Purchase?

29
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:22,266
- I don't think anybody's mad about that.
- Exactly! Because it's in the past.

30
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,271
Anybody going to eat that?

31
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:35,320
Look at us all dressed up for the party.
What are we celebrating?

32
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,323
We had a lot of liquor
left over from the Christmas party.

33
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,577
I think this is cool.
None of our friends are here.

34
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,996
We can be a real couple.
We don't have to hide.

35
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,874
- I know. I can do this.
- Ooh.

36
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,750
And I can do this.

37
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,296
- We can't do that.
- We can't do that.

38
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,799
Hey, Bing! Ha-ha-ha.

39
00:02:56,467 --> 00:03:00,012
Whoa! Who's the pretty lady,
and what is she doing with you?

40
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,849
Ha-ha-ha! I ask myself that very question.
This is Monica.

41
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,852
- My boss, Doug. This is Monica.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

42
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,646
- Hi! This is my wife, Kara.
- Nice to meet you.

43
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,148
- Bing!
- Okay!

44
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,985
Did you hear about the new law firm
working for us?

45
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,029
- No, sir.
- Yeah, Dewey, Cheatem & Howe.

46
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,452
Come on, let's go drink our body weight.

47
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,372
- What was that?
- What?

48
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,707
That noise you made?

49
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,877
- Oh, that was my work laugh.
- Your work laugh?

50
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:36,006
If you're going to survive this party,
you have to come up with one too.

51
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,426
- All right. Check me out.
- Okay.

52
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,471
He says, "$30, Father.
Same as in town." Ha!

53
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:52,522
Hey, everybody at work
loved you last night.

54
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,233
- Really?
- And they like me more...

55
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,943
...just because I was with you.

56
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,112
You repaired a lot of the damage
from when they met Joey.

57
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,451
Doug wants us to play tennis.
He's never talked to me outside of work.

58
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,037
Except for that time
at that strip club.

59
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,041
Strip church.

60
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,046
- I'm gonna go try to find a racket.
- I thought you had one.

61
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:20,300
I used to, but then Joey thought it'd be fun
to go to Central Park and hit rocks...

62
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,219
...at bigger rocks.

63
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,430
- Hey, Rach, do you have a tennis racket?
- Hey.

64
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,392
Oh, um, I lent it to Joey
and I've never gotten it back.

65
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,686
Okay, good luck with that.

66
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,023
- Ahem. Hey.
- Hey.

67
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,400
What's up?

68
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,278
What are you doing here?
I thought you had inventory.

69
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,863
Well I do, but I decided I'd take
a long lunch...

70
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,616
...and spend some time
with my friend, Monica.

71
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,453
You know, I feel like
we don't talk anymore.

72
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,122
How are you?

73
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,790
What is new with you?

74
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,168
Heh, um...

75
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,629
Not much. Um, work's good.

76
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,924
We don't have to talk about work.
We could talk about anything.

77
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,593
Okay. Um...

78
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,554
Hey! You know what?

79
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,931
Let's talk about relationships.

80
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,143
- Okay. What's going on with you?
- Nothing.

81
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,812
You go.

82
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,399
Well, I... There was this guy at the bank
that I thought was cute.

83
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,609
Um, but I don't anymore.

84
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,697
Wow, that's, uh, juicy. Ahem, um...

85
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:27,159
You know what? I actually do
have a lot of work to do.

86
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,746
You're sure there's just
not anything else?

87
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:34,499
Yes, I'm sure. Is there something
you want to talk to me about?

88
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,917
No.

89
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,297
I...

90
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,507
If there was, I wouldn't tell you.

91
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,767
Okay, then what happened?

92
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,020
Uh, oh! Aw.

93
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,563
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

94
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,900
Ah-ah, you'll get your turn.

95
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,903
- Hey, Pheebs. What's going on?
- Hey. Nothing.

96
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,446
This is not over.

97
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,699
- No, no, no!
- What?

98
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,244
Ugh, I was up all night writing
this really nasty letter to Emily.

99
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,373
It was perfect,
and now it's all covered in...

100
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,249
Actually, thanks!

101
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,086
All right!
Everybody ready to go to the movies?

102
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:22,172
Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.

103
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,633
- Really?
- I'm gonna stay and read my book.

104
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,593
I just want to be alone right now.

105
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,345
Oh. Sure you don't want to come?

106
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:32,682
Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan.
They get mail and stuff.

107
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,894
- That's okay, Joe.
- All right.

108
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,687
Let's go, Pheebs.

109
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,109
Oh, God!

110
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,448
Bing!

111
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,078
- Unh!
- Aah!

112
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,871
Game!

113
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,210
Yeah, I gotta tell you,
that partner of yours is a real tiger.

114
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,171
Are you all right?

115
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,884
We'll just get
a little sip of water.

116
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,389
Am I on fire today or what?

117
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,726
Those birds are browned,
basted and ready to be carved.

118
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,396
Okay, easy, Martina.

119
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,692
I think we should let them
win the next game.

120
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,862
I'm sorry, I don't understand
what you just said.

121
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,239
Let them win one.

122
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,660
Are you crazy? We own those two.
Look at them!

123
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,955
He can't even breathe,
and she's popping pills.

124
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,749
You're not giving them a chance.

125
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,460
They have rackets, don't they?

126
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,756
Uh, Bing, I think we're gonna
make this the last game.

127
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,967
Yes, sir. Put me out of my misery.

128
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,720
Are you sure you never played pro?
Ha-ha-ha.

129
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,096
Please let them win.

130
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,975
I'll take it down to 95 percent,
but that's the best I can do.

131
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,649
- Oopsie! Missed it!
- I got it!

132
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,529
Nice shot.

133
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,540
I got it!

134
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,126
Long!

135
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,468
I can't believe you let them win.

136
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,930
Yeah, well, at least you hid
your feelings well about it.

137
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,891
- I was frustrated.
- It was my racket.

138
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,351
I was frustrated with you!

139
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,147
If we hadn't lost, they would never have
invited us to dinner tomorrow.

140
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,482
What bothers me...

141
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,068
...is how different
you act around them.

142
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,196
The throwing the tennis games,
the fake laugh...

143
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,241
...the "See you later, Bing!"
"Not if I see you first, Doug!"

144
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,664
I don't like "work Chandler."
The guy's a suck-up.

145
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,291
You know what?
Because you said that...

146
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,377
...I'm not putting out tonight!

147
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,887
Something's wrong.
My brother does not stay out all night.

148
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,181
Maybe we should check
the trash chute.

149
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,143
Ross couldn't fit
down the trash chute.

150
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,604
That's right. He almost could.

151
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,315
Which is exactly
how I got stuck there.

152
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,360
- Hey!
- Hey.

153
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,070
Oh, my God!

154
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,447
Where the hell have you been?

155
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,534
Just, you know, out.

156
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:42,289
Oh, out! God, I don't know
why we didn't think to check there.

157
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,999
What were you doing?

158
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,002
I, uh, went to a bar and then...

159
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,630
...I just, uh, walked around for a while.

160
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,050
You walked around all night
in the city by yourself?

161
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,095
He hooked up!

162
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,390
He hooked up with someone.

163
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,810
I don't have to answer your questions.
Okay? I'm a big boy.

164
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,353
I can do whatever I want.

165
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,813
He hooked up!

166
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,067
Tell us about her!

167
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,403
Ross, you left your scarf...

168
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,454
Hey, you guys.

169
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,089
Okay. Okay.

170
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:37,177
I know what you all are thinking,
but Chandler is in Yemen.

171
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:42,223
I'm a young woman. I have needs.
I can't wait forever.

172
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,476
Yeah, no, that's what I was thinking.

173
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,857
So I'm asking you, please
just take a moment before you judge me.

174
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,359
Oh, nobody's judging you.

175
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,694
Oh.

176
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:58,365
Okay, you,
Mr. Right-place-at-the-right-time...

177
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,701
...call me.

178
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,004
Okay, look,
I know what you guys are going to say.

179
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,840
You two would have
very hairy children.

180
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,427
I didn't know you'd say that.

181
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,472
Ross! Janice?

182
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,599
All right. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

183
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,643
This is Ross. Okay?

184
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:30,021
He's our friend.
He obviously went crazy.

185
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,232
He obviously lost his mind.

186
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:36,736
I didn't lose my mind, okay?
Janice and I have a lot in common.

187
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:41,116
We've both been divorced.
We both have kids.

188
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,243
Are you going to see her again?

189
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,246
- Don't put ideas in his head!
- I am gonna see her again.

190
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,498
Damn it, Phoebe!

191
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,964
I have to tell you something
that I've never admitted.

192
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:00,343
In high school, I made out with James
even though I knew that you liked him.

193
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,805
Wow! That feels so good
to get off my chest. Okay, you go.

194
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,892
- My turn? What are you talking about?
- Ugh.

195
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,352
Monica...

196
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,313
I know about you and Chandler.

197
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,482
What?

198
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,026
I overheard you
on the phone the other day.

199
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:21,531
You said, "I'll tell Rachel I'm doing
laundry for a couple of hours."

200
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,784
And he said, "Laundry?
Is that my new nickname?"

201
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,870
And you said, "No.

202
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:31,040
You know what
your nickname is, Mr. Big."

203
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,588
Well, heh...

204
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,591
Sounds like you're writing yourself
a little play there, Rach.

205
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,304
Wow, I... Let me know how
that one turns out.

206
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:48,975
I wouldn't know because I got
so freaked out I hung up the phone.

207
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,603
Well, if you had kept listening, ha-ha-ha...

208
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,565
...you would have heard me
call him Mister Big...

209
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,650
...ot.
- What?

210
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,611
Mr. Bigot.

211
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:04,574
Ha, ha. He tells the most racist jokes.

212
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,077
All right. So that's it.

213
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,956
You're telling me there's nothing going on
between you and Chandler?

214
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,167
Me and Chandler?

215
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,548
- Put your $20 down.
- Okay.

216
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,967
First one to find the tasty treat wins.

217
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,844
- Okay? All right.
- Mm-hm.

218
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,264
Let's get the contestants
out of their isolation booths.

219
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,850
And they're off!

220
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,435
Whoa.

221
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,771
Get your foot off my contestant!
Judge?

222
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,940
Judge rules no violation.

223
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,191
Agh.

224
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,944
- Hey, guys.
- Yeah.

225
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:46,324
It's so weird to say this,
but I just had a great date with Janice.

226
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,076
- What?
- Are you serious?

227
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:52,914
Yeah. I opened up to her about all the
terrible stuff that's been happening to me.

228
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,208
I mean, I talked for hours.

229
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,501
It is amazing...

230
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,296
...to have someone give you
such focused attention.

231
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,466
You don't need Janice for that.
You've got us.

232
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,719
- And the duck gets the Nutter Butter!
- No! Agh!

233
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,597
That's not a Nutter Butter.
That's an old won ton!

234
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,099
Judge rules...

235
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,393
...Nutter Butter.
- Ugh.

236
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,061
- Tough call.
- Yeah.

237
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:24,028
Seriously, I strongly believe that
we should all support President Clinton...

238
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,530
...and her husband, Bill.

239
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,035
So how do you like your coffee?

240
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,246
- None for me.
- Just a little bit of sugar.

241
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,456
I'll have Monica stick her finger in it.

242
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,000
That ought to sweeten it up.

243
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,465
- How does that not give you a headache?
- You get used to it.

244
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,134
I don't think that I can.

245
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,803
Maybe this will be it for me
on the work things.

246
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,431
So I laugh at my boss's jokes.
What's the big deal?

247
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,142
I'd rather not hang out with
this work-weasel guy...

248
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,645
...when I could be with my boyfriend,
who I actually respect.

249
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,147
Oh.

250
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,858
Ah, heh.

251
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,319
I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee.

252
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,487
I'd feel sorry for it if it got in a fight.

253
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:10,533
It's not strong enough
to defend itself. Ha-ha-ha!

254
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,913
Hear what I said?

255
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,081
What?

256
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,418
It's a joke, Bing.
What's the matter with you?

257
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,671
Well, I just didn't think
it was funny, sir.

258
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:24,923
Excuse me?

259
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,384
- Well, I just...
- Honey?

260
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,095
I just don't think
you understood the joke.

261
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,723
- Really?
- Yeah.

262
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,310
I mean, it was really funny.
I just don't think that you got it.

263
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:41,064
Heh, you see,
Kara's coffee is weak-tasting.

264
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:45,193
But what Doug did was imply
that it was weak physically.

265
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,614
- You get it now, honey?
- I think I do!

266
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,080
- Thank you, Monica.
- I thought you could use the help.

267
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,831
Ha-ha-ha.

268
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,416
Coffee in a fight!

269
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,381
Hey, Rach.

270
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,050
You mind if I read
my comic books in here?

271
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,638
Sure. Why?

272
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,809
Chandler and Monica are over there.
It's kind of hard to concentrate.

273
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,438
What? She just called and said
she was going to be working late.

274
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,399
She keeps lying to me.

275
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:28,653
That's it! I'm gonna go over there
and I'm confronting them right now.

276
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:43,459
So you're telling me
that I have to tell racist jokes now?

277
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,504
I'm just not very good at this.

278
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,590
I'm a terrible liar.
I hate having to lie to Rachel.

279
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,552
- But we're not ready to tell yet.
- I know.

280
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,473
Ever since high school, Rachel was
the one person that I told everything to.

281
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,892
I miss that so much now.

282
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,437
She's my best friend.

283
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,278
Joey?

284
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,989
- Oh, my God, Rachel!
- Hey!

285
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,866
Hi!

286
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,369
What are you doing here?

287
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,958
Well, I actually came over here
to borrow this lamp...

288
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,711
...to, um, look at my books.

289
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,963
You know, see them a little better. Heh.

290
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,593
- Okay, great. Great. Um...
- Yeah.

291
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,305
Well, what I was doing
in Chandler's room is that, um...

292
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,848
...I was cleaning it.

293
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,810
- In fact, he pays me to clean it.
- Oh!

294
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:46,439
What a great way to make
some extra pocket money.

295
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,027
When I said to you earlier
that I was at work, um...

296
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,945
...I'm at my new work.

297
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,907
Good enough. Right?

298
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,035
Okay, well, um...

299
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,329
I'm gonna go look at my books.

300
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,833
- Okay. Go get back to my new job.
- Okay.

301
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,795
Okay.

302
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,342
Congratulations on your new job!

303
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,892
Man, she is really gullible.

304
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,818
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

305
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,612
- Actually, I should get going.
- You're sure?

306
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,073
I can stay out as late as you want.

307
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,367
I told you I'm on
sabbatical from work...

308
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,537
Yes, yes. You did. Ha-ha-ha.

309
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,081
- Oh, man!
- What is wrong now?

310
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,167
This isn't what I ordered.

311
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:52,547
Man! Can't anything
go right in my life?

312
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,259
First, my marriage falls apart,
and then...

313
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,593
I know, I know!

314
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,555
You lose your apartment,
then you lose your job...

315
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,766
...then your ex-wife gets married so fast!
And now the coffee!

316
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,518
Aah!

317
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,395
Ross...

318
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,314
...we need to talk.
- Okay.

319
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,734
- Sometimes I feel...
- No, no, don't.

320
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,903
I'm going to talk.

321
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,239
I believe...

322
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,325
...that the sun has set...

323
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,787
...on our day in the sun.

324
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:30,710
- What?
- You're a very sweet person, Ross.

325
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,753
Um...

326
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,714
Unfortunately...

327
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:39,093
...I just don't think I can take
another second of you whining!

328
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:45,516
Let me make sure
I'm hearing this right.

329
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:50,146
You're ending this with me because...

330
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,939
...I'm too whiny?

331
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,441
Mm.

332
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,111
So you're saying...

333
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,531
...I've become so whiny...

334
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,450
...that I...

335
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,328
...annoy you...

336
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,164
...Janice.

337
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,749
Well, yeah!

338
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,543
Oh, my God!

339
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,716
- Are you gonna be okay?
- I am now.

340
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,301
Okay.

341
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,308
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

342
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,769
Well...

343
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,647
I guess, that's two out of three...

344
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,815
...Joey!

345
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,746
- Dude, we gotta talk.
- Okay.

346
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,708
I want to tell you something before
you heard it from someone else.

347
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,379
I hope this isn't too weird but, uh...

348
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,924
...I had a thing with Janice.

349
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,222
You're not mad?

350
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,640
Why would I be mad?

351
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,060
Because there's certain rules
about this kind of stuff.

352
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,022
You don't, uh... You don't fool around
with your friends' ex-girlfriends...

353
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,315
...or, uh...

354
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,568
...possible girlfriends
or girls they're related to.

355
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,575
I am mad.

356
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,913
But you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna forgive you.

357
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,124
Because that's what friends do.

358
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,294
They forgive their friends when
they do everything you just said.

359
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,005
- All the things on the list there.
- Thank you.

360
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,923
But I want you to remember...

361
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,467
...that I forgave you.

362
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,887
- Okay.
- I also want you to remember...

363
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,974
...that I let you live here rent-free.

364
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,852
- All right.
- And I want you to remember...

365
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,606
...that I gave you 27 dollars.

366
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,151
No strings attached!

367
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,861
If you can't remember that...

368
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,697
...I think we should write it down.
Let's write it down!
