- Hi.
GROUP: Hi.

2
00:00:04,547 --> 00:00:07,758
So I'm in my apartment doing
the Soap Opera <i>Digest</i> crossword puzzle...

3
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:11,637
...and guess who is the clue
for three down?

4
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:15,683
<i>Three down. "Days of Our Lives star,
blank Tribbiani."</i>

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,103
That's me! I'm blank! Hey.

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,190
How cool is. We know three down.
I'm touching three down.

7
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,317
Yeah, you are, baby.

8
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:26,819
Three down knows I'm married.

9
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:29,280
- What's three down doing?
- Sorry.

10
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:32,116
So do they call you to tell you
your name's gonna be in this?

11
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:33,743
No. They really liked me there.

12
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,995
They wanted to do a profile on me.
I said no.

13
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:37,621
Why'd you say no?

14
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,458
Remember what happened
the last time I did an interview?

15
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:44,086
I said I write a lot of my own lines,
then the writers got mad...

16
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,672
...and made my character fell down
the elevator shaft.

17
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,008
So who knows
what I might say this time?

18
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:53,345
If only there was something in your head
to control the things you say.

19
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:57,183
Oh, come on, Joey,
you'll totally keep it in check this time.

20
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:00,144
And plus, you know, the publicity
would be really good for your career.

21
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:01,896
And you deserve that.

22
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:04,482
And if you do the interview,
you could mention...

23
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:07,526
...oh, I don't know, gal pal Rachel Green.

24
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:11,072
Is that "gal pal" spelled L-O-S-E-R?

25
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:14,408
Okay, don't listen to him. Please?

26
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,869
Fine, all right, I'll do it.

27

But, hey. You guys have to be
at the next table...

you know, start to say something stupid.

Just then or all the time?
Because we have jobs, you know?

taking the time to do this.

Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.

00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:37,950
No. We're just four people with
neck problems, who talk like this.

I think it's great
that you wanted to meet here.

40
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,039
When most people hear
that the magazine's paying for it...

41
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:47,793
...they want a big, fancy restaurant.

42
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,421
Actually, I didn't know
the magazine was paying.

43
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:53,257
Wouldn't have mattered.

44
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:56,886
I'm doing this for the fans,
not the free food. Ha, ha.

45
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,555
- Can I get you anything?
- I'll have a cup of coffee.

46

Yeah, and I'll have all the muffins.

First, there's a layer of ladyfingers,
then a layer of jam.

140
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:41,123
Then custard,
which I made from scratch.

141
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,584
Then raspberries, more ladyfingers...

142
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,003
...then beef sautéed
with peas and onions.

143
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,589
Then a little bit more custard.

144
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,217
It tastes like feet.

145
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,929
I like it.

146
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:03,145
- Are you kidding?
- What's not to like? Custard, good.

147
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:06,523
Jam, good. Meat, good.

- Not anymore.

153
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,962
Oh, look. There's a piece
that doesn't have floor on it.

154
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,382
- Stick to your side.
- Hey, come on, now.

Uh, I don't believe in these crazy diets.
You know, just everything in moderation.

157
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,824

You were on the show years ago
and then they killed you off.

163
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,590
Oh, it's so stupid.

164
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,593
I said some stuff in an interview
