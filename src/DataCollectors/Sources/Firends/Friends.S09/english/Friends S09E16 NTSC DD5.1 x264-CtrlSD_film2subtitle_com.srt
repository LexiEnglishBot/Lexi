1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:02,901
She's crawling! Emma's crawling!

2
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:05,629
He's bleeding! Joey's bleeding!

3
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:09,172
l'm sorry. You've gotta see this.
l'm gonna go get Monica and Chandler.

4
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:12,102
Monica! Chandler!

5
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,241
Come over! Come over!
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

6
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,512
What? What?

7
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:22,547
-Shaving?
-No, rabies.

8
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,891
-What's going on?
-lt's Emma. She's crawling.

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,394
Wow, look at her go.

10
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:35,056
Give her a second.

11
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,404
l can't believe how fast she's growing up.
lt seems like only yesterday she was...

12
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,308
...farting on my lap.

13
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:51,450
Not so funny when someone
does that to you, is it?

14
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:55,384
Emma, come on. Show everybody
how you were crawling.

15
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:03,952
l think we're distracting her.
Let's everybody be still for a minute.

16
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,976
Who's painting us?

17
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:03,144
Have you seen our bank statement?
Can this be right?

18
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:07,089
l know. God, l haven't seen
my savings take a hit like this...

19
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,822
...since l was a kid and they came up
with Double Stuf Oreos.

20
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:15,866
-What happened to all of our money?
-l'm not sure exactly what they did...

21
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,663
...but l'm inclined to blame Enron.

22
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:24,237
With you doing the internship, we're
spending more than we're bringing in.

23
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:29,009
Yeah, maybe l should quit
and get a job that pays.

24
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,775
But you're finally doing something
that you love.

25
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,385
l mean, l can't ask you to give that up.

26
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:39,719
Although it would be nice if the thing
that you loved was finding gold.

27
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,623
You know, l think we're making
too big a deal out of this.

28
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:46,731
We'll pay our bills late this month. Next
month we'll cut back on a few things.

29
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,132
And maybe we start eating
out of Joey's refrigerator for a change.

30
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:55,434
You're a chef. What can you make
out of baking soda and beer?

31
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,611
Worst-case scenario is, we borrow
some money from my parents.

32
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,012
Or, you slipped on ice at their house
last month. Can we sue them?

33
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,813
No, and we're not borrowing money.

34
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,956
-Why not?
-We don't do that. We are Bings.

35
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,653
lf there's one thing my father
taught me, it was...

36
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:20,629
...well, to always knock
before going into the pool house.

37
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:25,532
-The other thing is, never borrow money.
-l had no idea you had this much pride.

38
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:29,539
That's right, l do. l am your man.
l'm gonna get us through this situation...

39
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,270
...even if it means you working
twice as hard.

40
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,813
You know, it's just really weird.

41
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:45,424
You don't like eating animals, but you love
watching them tear each other apart.

42
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,959
No, l don't-- Get him. Get him!

43
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:52,325
Separate the sick one from the herd!

44
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,891
-l'm gonna go.
-Why?

45
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:58,035
l haven't been home in days,
and l need to get more clothes.

46
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,036
You don't have to go.
l have something that'll fit you.

47
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:05,338
l put that tube top on as a joke.

48
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,108
-l want you to stay.
-l want to stay too.

49
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,876
But l've got as much use
out of these boxers as l can.

50
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,253
-Why don't you turn them inside--
-Done it.

51
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:19,049
-l'll be back in a couple of hours.
-All right. l'll miss you.

52
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,454
Me too.

53
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,229
Oh, fine. Yeah, you got away.

54
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,424
But don't look so smug.
You're gonna bleed to death.

55
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:33,231
You know what? l just realized something.
l don't want to go home.

56
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,739
-Great! Okay, l'll go get the tube top.
-No, no, what l mean is...

57
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,743
...l hate going back
to my apartment now.

58
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:45,111
Partly because l live above
a known crack den...

59
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,482
...but, you know, mostly because
when l'm there, l really miss you.

60
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,486
So...

61
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,890
...do you want to move in together?

62
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,064
Wow, Mike Hanigan...

63
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,429
...you sure know how to
make a girl say ''Hell, yeah.''

64
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,630
-So we're doing it?
-Yeah, let's do it. Let's live together.

65
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,371
-We're really gonna move in together?
-Yeah.

66
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:15,846
l've always wanted to live with a guy.

67
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,779
Pick up your socks.
Put down the toilet seat.

68
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:22,580
No, we are not having sex anymore.

69
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,417
lt's gonna be fun.

70
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,658
Shame on you, <i>TV Guide</i>.

71
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,628
A man's ass is not nudity!

72
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,802
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey.

73
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:41,734
Listen, l need to know
that what l'm about to ask you...

74
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:45,469
...will never get back to Chandler.

75
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:52,381
l'd be lying if l said l hadn't
thought about it myself.

76
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:58,114
But Chandler is my best friend.
lt would be wrong.

77
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,385
Good, but wrong.

78
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:06,120
Okay, first of all, it would be great.

79
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,700
But that's not what l'm here to talk
to you about. l need to borrow money.

80
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:13,099
Oh, l don't know, Monica.
You know...

81
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,297
...lending friends money
is always a mistake.

82
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:19,741
-But Chandler lent you money.
-And he would tell you it was a mistake.

83
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:23,507
Come on, l just.... l need it
for some rent and some other bills.

84
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,812
Well, how much?

85
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,819
-Two thousand dollars?
-Two thousand dollars?

86
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:33,618
What do you think l am,
a soap opera star?

87
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,489
-Yeah.
-That's right, l am.

88
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,964
Promise me you'll never tell Chandler.

89
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,357
lt'll really hurt his pride.

90
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,696
Chandler? Pride?

91
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,964
l know, he thinks he has it.
lt's really cute.

92
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,339
-Hi, you guys.
-Hey.

93
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,843
-What's in the bag?
-You know how Emma started crawling?

94
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:57,972
l realized that this place
is very unsafe for a baby...

95
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:02,087
...so l went to the store and l got some
stuff to baby-proof the apartment.

96
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,279
Oh, God, baby-proofing.

97
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,948
Why is it such a big deal now?
You know, when l was a kid, it was like:

98
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:11,358
''Whoops, Joey fell down the stairs.''

99
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:15,695
Or, ''Whoops, Joey electrocuted
himself again.''

100
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:20,504
Anyway, are you going to get
a handyman to install this stuff?

101
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:24,165
No, l was just gonna do it myself.

102
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,312
-You're gonna do it?
-Yeah. Why?

103
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:34,249
-You don't think a woman can do this?
-Women can. You can't.

104
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:39,549
Monica, will you please tell Joey
that he is a pig.

105
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:43,491
-You're a pig. And you can't do this.
-What?

106
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:47,190
What? Come on, l found
the hardware store all by myself.

107
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,231
The store's right down the street.

108
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,996
There is a hardware store
right down the street?

109
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,738
Hey, you guys?
Okay, we've got great news.

110
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:02,347
-Phoebe and l are moving in together.
-Congratulations.

111
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:06,042
l know, it's so exciting. You know,
l've never lived with a guy before.

112
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:10,188
Well, it's just like living with a girl,
only they don't steal your makeup.

113
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,756
Unless they're playing ''This ls What
My Sister Would Look Like.''

114
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,218
Yeah, she's not so cute.

115
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:21,095
-l'm gonna go to the bathroom.
-Well, you put down the toilet seat.

116
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,268
Yes, dear.

117
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,706
-ls that a bit you guys do?
-Uh-huh. We're playing you two.

118
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:33,273
We don't do that.
Tell her we don't do that.

119
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,677
Yes, dear.

120
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:40,182
l can't believe you're moving in together.
l'm happy for you guys.

121
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,550
l mean, he's a great catch.
And those eyes....

122
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,284
l'm a scientist. l observe.

123
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:53,022
Gosh, this is so exciting!
You guys are really moving along.

124
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,100
-l hear wedding bells.
-Monica, slow down, okay?

125
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,931
l'm just excited to be living with him.

126
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,096
You know, l mean, l don't know...

127
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,675
...can l see someday being
married to Mike? Sure. Yeah.

128
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,313
l could picture myself walking down
the aisle in a wedding dress...

129
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,973
...that highlights my breasts
in an obvious yet classy way.

130
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,955
But do l want that house in Connecticut
near the good schools...

131
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:21,787
...where Mike and l could send
little Sophie and Mike Jr.?

132
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,656
Oh, my God, l do.

133
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,824
-l had no idea you were so conventional.
-l know. l guess l am.

134
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:32,664
Oh, my God, load up the Volvo,
l want to be a soccer mom.

135
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,441
-You ready to go?
-Yeah, you bet, roomie.

136
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:40,908
Don't you mean ''groomie''?

137
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,611
Honey, leave the terrible jokes to me.

138
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,078
-What are you talking about?
-Please.

139
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:53,089
We haven't even moved in yet, and
they have us picking out china patterns.

140
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,996
China patterns!

141
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:08,765
This is easy. ''Can't do this....''

142
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,143
Wow, seriously. Can't do this.

143
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,518
-Hey, Joe.
-Hey.

144
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,656
You here with somebody?

145
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,694
No.

146
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:36,890
Look, l need to ask you a favor,
and we can't tell Monica anything about it.

147
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:41,529
-l thought you guys didn't have secrets.
-That will remain the official party line.

148
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:47,813
Look, Monica and l are having
a little financial trouble.

149
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,583
-Yeah, l know.
-What? What do you mean, you ''know''?

150
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,111
l just figured it out, you know?

151
00:10:56,288 --> 00:11:00,816
l mean, you're not working,
and the economy is bad.

152
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,388
Oh, right.

153
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,894
That is the fastest l have ever thought.

154
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,731
Anyway...

155
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,197
...l need to borrow some money.

156
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:15,397
Oh, sure. Yeah, how much?
Two thousand dollars?

157
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,643
Yes, $2000 exactly.
How did you know that?

158
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:28,518
l know how much you used to make,
and l know how much your rent is.

159
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,414
Oh, okay.

160
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,922
l am on fire.

161
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,224
Listen, this is really nice.

162
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,659
Did you write a check to Monica
for $2000?

163
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,427
Did Monica borrow money from you?

164
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:49,067
-Kind of.
-l can't believe her.

165
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,368
Did she tell you we were having
money problems?

166
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,512
No, no, no. lt wasn't because
of your money problems.

167
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,706
lt was for something for her.

168
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,578
What?

169
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:00,878
Something personal.

170
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,089
What would she get for $2000
that she wouldn't tell me about?

171
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,518
Excuse me.

172
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,228
Boob job.

173
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,062
What? That's ridiculous.
She doesn't need a boob job.

174
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,265
Why wouldn't she tell me about it?

175
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:25,171
She was afraid you wouldn't be supportive.

176
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:28,244
-l'm not.
-She knows you well.

177
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,110
You can't tell her that you know.
l swore l wouldn't tell.

178
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,277
A boob job? She doesn't need that.
That's crazy.

179
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:37,354
Well, it's not that crazy, okay?

180
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:41,050
Making them smaller,
that would be crazy.

181
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:47,063
Hey, so where do you keep
your secret box of porn?

182
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,068
l don't have any porn.

183
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,435
Back of the closet in my bedroom.

184
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:59,233
Oh, hey, l wanted to ask you
about Monica's little ''groomie'' joke.

185
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:03,279
Well, l think the reason people laughed
is that it's a play on the word ''roomie.''

186
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:10,784
l get the joke. Sophisticated as it was.

187
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,653
No, the thing l want to say is....

188
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,520
Maybe we should've
talked about this before.

189
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:21,962
Us living together,
you're not expecting a proposal, right?

190
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,966
-Oh, no, no. Not at all.
-Okay.

191
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:28,607
We're just moving in right now.
We'll see where it goes.

192
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:33,168
Yeah, well, that's the thing.
For me, it's as far as it can ever go.

193
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:37,480
-What do you mean?
-Look, Phoebe, l....

194
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:42,087
l love you very much.
But l never want to get married again.

195
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,692
-Wow.
-lt's just, my first marriage was...

196
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:53,195
...you know, such a disaster that
l kind of lost faith in the whole idea.

197
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,663
-Was it that bad?
-At one point, near the end...

198
00:13:55,835 --> 00:14:00,169
-...she deliberately defecated on my--
-Okay, well, that's bad. Yeah.

199
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:05,737
But don't you think it might be
different with someone else? Perhaps...

200
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,641
...a blond who always
uses the toilet?

201
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,374
Except for once in the ocean.

202
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,186
Look, it's not about who l would marry.

203
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,883
l was certain the first time l got married
it'd last forever. l was wrong.

204
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,754
-But, it just--
-Look, Phoebe, it's not about you.

205
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,227
l just never want to get married again.

206
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,927
l'm sorry.

207
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,030
Are you okay with that? lf not, maybe
us moving in together isn't the best idea.

208
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,702
No. Oh, l definitely don't
want to get married.

209
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,747
l just wanted to make sure
you didn't want to, too.

210
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,883
Because if we move in
and you start changing your mind...

211
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,953
...there is gonna be
hell to pay, mister.

212
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,589
-Trust me. l will never--
-Yeah, l get that. Yeah.

213
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:03,000
Hi. So you gave in
and decided to call someone?

214
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:07,501
Yeah. l don't know who l was kidding.
l can barely use chopsticks.

215
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,733
-You're all set.
-Oh, thank you so much.

216
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,207
Wait. You forgot your...

217
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,813
...game.

218
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,539
Thank you.

219
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,844
-Rach, is this my sweater?
-Yeah.

220
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,817
What happened to the sleeve?

221
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,783
Moths?

222
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:31,992
Hey, Rach. There she is,
my perfectly proportioned wife.

223
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,859
Don't look at me.
l never get his jokes.

224
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,165
-Thank you?
-No, no. Don't thank me.

225
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:44,298
Thank you. Do you know there is not
one thing l would change about you?

226
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,741
Not one single thing.
And definitely not...

227
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,313
...two single things.

228
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:55,680
Okay, you're being weird. Do you want
sex, or did you do something bad?

229
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:59,517
No. No. No. l just love
the way you look. l am warm...

230
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,490
...for your form.

231
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:07,362
Okay, you know the old classics like,
you know, ''You look nice''?

232
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:08,659
They're still okay.

233
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:12,299
But ''you look nice'' could mean
that l'm saying, ''Your face looks nice.''

234
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,996
l want to compliment your body.

235
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,533
l mean, l wouldn't change it at all.

236
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:22,477
And more specifically, l wouldn't
want anything to get any bigger.

237
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,178
-Okay.
-l mean...

238
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,479
...you wouldn't want any part of me
to get any bigger, would you?

239
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,787
Don't answer that.

240
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:40,088
Just when you thought that dude
couldn't get any weirder.

241
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,034
Why do you think he was so worried
about me getting bigger?

242
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:47,433
l don't know.
l mean, what brought that on?

243
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:50,473
Oh, my God. You know what,
we're trying to get pregnant...

244
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,975
...so he's probably starting to freak out
that my body's gonna change.

245
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,614
-You think that's what it is?
-You heard him.

246
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,750
''No bigger. You're perfect.
Just don't get any bigger.''

247
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:04,321
My God, he sounded just like
my high-school wrestling coach.

248
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,887
-l'm gonna have to talk to Chandler.
-Yeah. lf you don't, l will.

249
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:13,793
Of course your body's gonna change.
Your breasts are gonna get bigger...

250
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,298
...your ass is gonna get bigger...

251
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:19,403
...you're gonna lose bladder control.

252
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,399
God, it's just such a magical time.

253
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:35,250
Hi. Listen, l wanted to ask you
something about marriage.

254
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,319
Now you're seeking me out
to make jokes?

255
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:41,448
l mean, l can see if we're all hanging
out, but to come to my home....

256
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,094
No, l really want to know
how you feel about it.

257
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,960
-Why?
-Mike doesn't ever want to get married.

258
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,635
-Never?
-Never.

259
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:54,102
Wow. Are you still gonna
move in with him?

260
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:59,001
l want to, but l wanted you to tell me
that marriage really isn't that big a deal.

261
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:03,615
You know, that l won't be missing out
on anything. That marriage stinks.

262
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,345
Yeah, marriage stinks.

263
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,623
l mean, if you want to see a man gain
weight and a woman stop shaving...

264
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,487
...get them married.

265
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,789
-That's not how you really feel, is it?
-No, l'm sorry.

266
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:24,527
l know it's not what you want to hear,
but l can't help it. l love marriage.

267
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,966
Seriously, you?
''Divorce-o''?

268
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:33,000
lf you have to call me a name, l'd prefer
''Ross, the Divorcer.'' lt's just cooler.

269
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:38,249
Look, l know my marriages
didn't exactly work out...

270
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,614
...but, you know, l loved being
that committed to another person.

271
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,654
And Carol and l had some good times
before she became a lesbian.

272
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,554
And once afterward.

273
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:51,059
Anyway, l'm sorry.

274
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,661
lt's okay. That's how you feel.

275
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,830
But, come on, l mean,
living together will be great.

276
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:00,836
l mean, you guys have so much fun.
And you love Mike.

277
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,704
-l do love Mike.
-Yeah, see?

278
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,208
And you were so excited about
moving in together before...

279
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,870
...and you know what, you should be.
lt's a big deal.

280
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,617
Yeah, l guess you're right.

281
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,946
Yeah, thanks. This helped. Thanks.

282
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,713
The Divorcer to the rescue.

283
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,518
-lt's not cooler.
-Yeah, l just heard it.

284
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,306
Rach?

285
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,378
Rachel?!

286
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:04,099
So l can't do anything l like?!

287
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,075
Unbelievable.

288
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:15,702
Chandler wants you to have a baby, but
he doesn't want your body to change.

289
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,508
lt's not like he's so perfect.

290
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,275
-Hey, that's my husband.
-All right.

291
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,284
Let's solve one problem at a time.

292
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,921
Hey, Rach.

293
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:29,822
Perfection.
Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.

294
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,019
-Honey?
-Yeah?

295
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,494
About that.

296
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:38,869
-l'm going to change.
-Yes, but, honey, you don't have to.

297
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,163
l'm gonna get bigger.

298
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,772
Honey, l....

299
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,933
l love your breasts the way they are.

300
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,813
Fascist.

301
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,441
My breasts are gonna get bigger
whether you like it or not.

302
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:56,109
And it's not just my breasts.
My ass is gonna get bigger too.

303
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,846
Your ass?!

304
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:03,892
And don't be surprised if her hands
and her feet get bigger too.

305
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,532
-They do that?
-lt's kind of a package deal.

306
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:12,232
God, why? Why would you want to
do that to yourself?

307
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:15,167
l thought it was something
that we both wanted.

308
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:19,337
lf it means that much to you, l may be
able to get onboard with the boobs...

309
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:23,208
...but the giant ass
and the big clown feet?

310
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,911
Oh, my God, Chandler.

311
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,178
lf you can't handle this,
what will you be like in the hospital...

312
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:33,552
...with the blood and screaming and the
little person that's shooting out of her?

313
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,827
What?

314
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:48,700
Joey, why did you tell Chandler
that Monica was getting a boob job?

315
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,565
Because she is.

316
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:55,577
-Chandler knows l borrowed the money.
-For your boob job.

317
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,581
-Joe....
-lt's over.

318
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:02,914
Okay, so l'm out $4000 and
nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?

319
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:11,889
Hey. Hey, what do you guys think
about this: Ross, the Divorce Force.

320
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,929
-Better.
-Yeah?

321
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,167
Very cool.

322
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,604
Hey, Pheebs? You know, l'm really glad
you came to talk to me the other day...

323
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:25,800
-...and l hope l was a little helpful.
-Yeah, you were helpful.

324
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:27,774
-Yeah. No, thank you.
-Good. Good.

325
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:31,312
Because the more l thought about it,
the more l realized...

326
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:35,180
...l don't think marriage is necessarily
the right path for you.

327
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,580
What do you mean?

328
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,814
l know the other day
in the coffeehouse...

329
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,118
...you were all caught up
in the whole soccer-mom thing...

330
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:46,492
...but is that really you? l mean, can you
honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?

331
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:50,430
They are awfully boxy.

332
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:56,133
People like me like stability
and security. You don't.

333
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,674
And that's what's so incredible
about you.

334
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:03,178
You got this wild and crazy life.

335
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:09,218
l mean, l don't know, you'd be so bored
with marriage. l mean, it's so normal.

336
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,514
Yeah.

337
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,249
Hey, can l help?

338
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:18,020
Well, we climbed up four flights of stairs,
maneuvered a narrow hallway...

339
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:22,530
...dodged a rabid pit bull. But these last
three feet are where it gets really tricky.

340
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:28,829
You know, sometimes your words,
they hurt.

341
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,566
Hey, where do you guys want this?

342
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,372
Yeah, seriously,
because this is really heavy.

343
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:39,984
l mean, not for me, because l'm only
pretending to hold it, but for these guys.

344
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:47,621
Just one last time on the marriage thing.
There's no wiggle room? None at all?

345
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,994
No, but you don't want to
get married either, right?

346
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,390
Right.

347
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,930
Except that l do want to get married.

348
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:58,261
Couldn't have had this conversation
down at the truck, huh?

349
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,131
What? You want to get married?

350
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,002
Someday.

351
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,507
And...hernia.

352
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:13,918
l haven't had a normal life. And l never
felt like l was missing out on anything.

353
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:18,522
But it feels like now it's my turn
to have some of the regular stuff.

354
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,092
Why didn't you say something before?

355
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:26,890
l didn't know how much l wanted it. And
l love you, and l wanted to live with you.

356
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:29,533
l want to live with you too.
l mean, let's do that.

357
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,793
But l don't think l can.

358
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,906
lt was okay to move in when
l didn't know what was gonna happen.

359
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:39,601
But l can't move in knowing nothing
is ever gonna happen.

360
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:43,339
l said to bring the cushions
up first, but no.

361
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:50,712
Can we at least try living together? You
might change your mind about marriage.

362
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:53,914
Are you gonna change yours?

363
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,552
No.

364
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:59,322
Me neither.

365
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:08,063
l think l need to be with someone
who wants what l want.

366
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,302
But l don't want this to end.

367
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:15,444
No, l don't want it to end either.

368
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,645
l can't believe this is gonna end.

369
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,521
l guess l'll have my stuff picked up.

370
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,450
Yeah. Okay.

371
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:35,892
Okay, so....

372
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,107
Goodbye.

373
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:56,081
-Take it easy, Mike.
-Bye, Mike.

374
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:01,615
l'm so sorry, Pheebs.

375
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:04,523
We're all sorry.

376
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:12,534
Look on the bright side. At least you
won't have to live with this ugly chair.

377
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,071
That was here already, huh?

378
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,708
l love you.

379
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,246
l did it! l did it!

380
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:35,449
All right.

381
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:42,898
l'd better take all l can carry.

382
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:47,471
Who knows when l'll be able
to get in here again, huh?

383
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,998
