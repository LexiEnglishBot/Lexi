1
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:10,087
None of that.
Not while you're under my roof!

2
00:00:12,324 --> 00:00:16,317
Just because l know about you
doesn't mean l like looking at it.

3
00:00:16,995 --> 00:00:19,293
Aren't you supposed to be
at an audition?

4
00:00:19,498 --> 00:00:22,433
l'm sorry l'm not
a middle-aged black woman.

5
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:28,269
l'm also sorry if sometimes
l go to the wrong audition.

6
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:33,341
lf l pretend to not know about you...

7
00:00:33,612 --> 00:00:36,137
...then you pretend
there's nothing to know.

8
00:00:37,783 --> 00:00:38,772
Sorry.

9
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:46,590
l can hear that!

10
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,927
Rachel's at work.

11
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:57,660
l can still hear you!

12
00:00:59,438 --> 00:01:01,303
The One With the Yeti

13
00:01:48,353 --> 00:01:49,445
What's that?

14
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:53,522
My mom sent me an heirloom
that belonged to my grandmother.

15
00:01:53,692 --> 00:01:54,681
Can you believe it?

16
00:01:54,893 --> 00:01:58,989
A year ago l had no family,
and now l have heirlooms!

17
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,824
The only heirloom l ever got
was a feather boa.

18
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:06,198
Got if from my dad.
He got it from his dad.

19
00:02:07,172 --> 00:02:09,766
How did l ever get born?

20
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:20,440
Oh, God!

21
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:24,954
Soft.

22
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:27,522
ls this mink?

23
00:02:27,993 --> 00:02:32,862
Why would my mother send me a fur?
Doesn't she know me but at all?

24
00:02:33,565 --> 00:02:37,865
l have a fine coat that no innocent
animals suffered to make.

25
00:02:38,136 --> 00:02:41,230
Just Filipino kids who worked
their fingers bloody...

26
00:02:41,473 --> 00:02:42,838
...for 1 2 cents an hour.

27
00:02:45,844 --> 00:02:47,334
l made that up.

28
00:02:52,384 --> 00:02:54,978
You can't put up flyers in here.

29
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:57,184
How come?
Everybody else does.

30
00:02:58,156 --> 00:02:59,589
You can't.

31
00:03:02,427 --> 00:03:03,724
What is that?

32
00:03:05,597 --> 00:03:07,827
l'm getting rid of some things.

33
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:10,034
This is all of your things.

34
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:13,094
Yes, it is.

35
00:03:13,672 --> 00:03:17,164
lt's good. Emily thinks
we should get all new stuff.

36
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:20,378
Stuff that's just ours.
Together. Brand new.

37
00:03:20,612 --> 00:03:23,547
So it's a get-rid-of-anything-
Rachel-ever-touched sale.

38
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:26,543
Touched, used, sat on, slept on....

39
00:03:26,952 --> 00:03:28,544
l'll take it all.

40
00:03:30,355 --> 00:03:31,754
You're okay with that?

41
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:33,854
lf l can just do what Emily wants...

42
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:36,856
...and get her to New York,
it will be fine.

43
00:03:37,095 --> 00:03:39,086
lsn't that a little extreme?

44
00:03:39,364 --> 00:03:42,299
After what l did, can you blame her?

45
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:43,556
You got off easy.

46
00:03:43,735 --> 00:03:46,533
When my friend's husband said
another name in bed...

47
00:03:46,738 --> 00:03:49,104
...she cursed him
and turned his thingy green.

48
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:54,609
l guess l'm lucky Emily is not magic.

49
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,605
Oh, she is.

50
00:03:57,783 --> 00:03:59,546
We all are.

51
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:08,354
What is he doing?

52
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:12,757
Emily thinks Ross' furniture
has got Rachel cooties?

53
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:14,927
Calm down, Joey.

54
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,225
Everything's getting all messed up!

55
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:19,096
Emily won't let Ross see Rachel.

56
00:04:19,437 --> 00:04:21,098
We won't stop seeing Rachel.

57
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:24,240
Hence, Ross stops seeing us.

58
00:04:24,676 --> 00:04:26,735
l hate this.
Everything's changing.

59
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:29,707
We're losing Ross.
Joey said ''hence.''

60
00:04:33,885 --> 00:04:38,345
l'm not happy about this either,
but if Ross says he's happy...

61
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,559
...then we have to keep
our feelings to ourselves.

62
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,091
Are you cool with that?

63
00:04:46,398 --> 00:04:48,696
But, you know, l'm an actor.

64
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,527
l'll act cool.

65
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:55,803
Probably be some of the hardest acting
l've ever done.

66
00:04:56,074 --> 00:04:58,872
Maybe l'll play it with a mustache.

67
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:08,943
Storage rooms give me the creeps.

68
00:05:09,154 --> 00:05:11,452
Please hurry up, honey.

69
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:15,456
lf you want little round waffles,
wait till l find the iron.

70
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:18,488
l want the little round waffles.

71
00:05:19,364 --> 00:05:20,388
Here it is!

72
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:24,196
Right underneath the can of bug bomb.

73
00:05:24,402 --> 00:05:28,896
ls the best place to put something
that cooks food underneath poison?

74
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,900
You know what?
l'll have toast.

75
00:05:36,982 --> 00:05:39,041
Fog him! Fog him!

76
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,685
l don't know what to do
about this coat.

77
00:05:47,893 --> 00:05:49,383
l'll take it.

78
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:51,495
That might work.

79
00:05:57,769 --> 00:05:59,396
What do you think?

80
00:05:59,671 --> 00:06:01,866
You're on in five, Ms. Minnelli.

81
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:07,102
No, it's just a bit sudden.

82
00:06:07,345 --> 00:06:10,246
lt's great, okay?
l am totally onboard.

83
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:12,615
l love you too.
All right, bye.

84
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:17,415
What's the matter?

85
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:20,021
Nothing. No, actually...

86
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:21,953
...great news!

87
00:06:22,193 --> 00:06:24,218
l just spoke with Emily...

88
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:27,523
...and looks like l'm moving
to a new apartment.

89
00:06:30,068 --> 00:06:31,057
Why?

90
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:33,997
Her thought is, and l agree...

91
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:38,504
...fresh new furniture,
why not a fresh new apartment?

92
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,575
Her cousin has a place to sublet.

93
00:06:40,812 --> 00:06:43,576
lt's got a view
of the river and Columbia.

94
00:06:43,748 --> 00:06:46,046
That's way uptown!
That's three trains away...

95
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:47,684
...which is great!

96
00:06:47,953 --> 00:06:50,183
l love to ride that rail.

97
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,553
You're okay with this?

98
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:56,454
lt's kind of far from work...

99
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:59,926
...but l'll get so much done
on the commute.

100
00:07:00,932 --> 00:07:03,799
l've been given the gift of time.

101
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:07,929
That's so funny. Last Christmas
l got the gift of space.

102
00:07:08,873 --> 00:07:12,036
We should get them together
and make a continuum.

103
00:07:16,314 --> 00:07:17,542
Now he's moving?

104
00:07:17,782 --> 00:07:20,649
Man, what is Emily doing to him?

105
00:07:22,153 --> 00:07:23,882
He's not even here!

106
00:07:25,623 --> 00:07:26,749
You guys!

107
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:30,821
We were in the storage area,
and we saw this creepy man.

108
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:34,259
lt was this crazy-eyed,
hairy beast-man.

109
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:37,400
lt was like a Big Foot
or a yeti or something.

110
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,732
He came at us,
so Rachel used a bug bomb on him.

111
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,307
l pulled the tab
and l just fogged his yeti ass.

112
00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:49,769
Like, dark hair, bushy beard?

113
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:52,476
Yeah, you fogged Danny.

114
00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:56,980
Please! We did not fog Danny.

115
00:07:57,188 --> 00:07:58,587
Who's Danny?

116
00:07:59,424 --> 00:08:00,686
Danny just moved in.

117
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,521
He just got back from a four-month
trek in the Andes. Nice fella.

118
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:08,660
He's nice.
You know, you always...

119
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,962
...stick up for the people we fog.

120
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:27,613
You might not remember us,
but we're the girls that fogged you.

121
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:30,512
We're really sorry we fogged you.

122
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:42,022
Just so you know,
we didn't mean to fog you.

123
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,461
We thought you were
like a yeti or something.

124
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:58,914
Sorry to bother you, but we can't
accept your acceptance of our apology.

125
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,880
lt doesn't really seem
like you mean it.

126
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,988
That guy is so rude!

127
00:09:10,228 --> 00:09:12,526
Really!
What is with that guy?

128
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:15,092
You'd forgive me if l fogged you.

129
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:17,198
You did, a little bit.

130
00:09:18,436 --> 00:09:20,904
Oh, my God, honey.
l'm so sorry.

131
00:09:21,372 --> 00:09:23,397
-l totally forgive you.
-Really?

132
00:09:30,281 --> 00:09:33,614
You know my friend Chris
who owns the crematorium?

133
00:09:33,852 --> 00:09:36,218
Crematorium Chris? Sure.

134
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:40,618
He said he would cremate
my fur coat for free...

135
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:44,351
...if l bring in the next person
l know who dies.

136
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:49,590
Oh, my God!

137
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:52,065
Oh, my God.
Look at these pelts!

138
00:09:53,304 --> 00:09:56,273
Don't get too attached.
She's having it cremated.

139
00:09:59,878 --> 00:10:03,746
You're quirky, and l get a big kick
out of it. We all do.

140
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:06,246
But if you destroy
a coat like this...

141
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:09,614
...that is like a crime
against nature.

142
00:10:10,088 --> 00:10:12,283
Not nature. Fashion!

143
00:10:12,757 --> 00:10:14,156
This is fashion?

144
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:16,858
So to you, death is fashion?

145
00:10:17,061 --> 00:10:18,153
That's funny.

146
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:20,226
Here's Phoebe...

147
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:24,332
...sporting cutting-edge
hairy carcass...

148
00:10:24,536 --> 00:10:28,939
...from, you know, the steel traps
of wintry Russia.

149
00:10:30,008 --> 00:10:32,203
You really think this looks good?

150
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,507
Because l do!

151
00:10:41,252 --> 00:10:43,482
l miss you too.
l can't wait to see you.

152
00:10:43,688 --> 00:10:45,212
l love you. Bye.

153
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,417
What is in here, rocks?

154
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:50,960
No, it's my collection
of fossil samples.

155
00:10:51,362 --> 00:10:53,023
So, rocks.

156
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:04,438
l'll miss this apartment.

157
00:11:04,943 --> 00:11:08,743
You know, Ben took his first steps
right over there.

158
00:11:09,814 --> 00:11:13,443
Remember when l ran into this
and it knocked me out?

159
00:11:15,253 --> 00:11:16,777
l love this place.

160
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:19,988
To tell the truth,
l wish l didn't have to move.

161
00:11:20,892 --> 00:11:25,386
Are you saying that you're not
entirely happy about this?

162
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:28,088
lf Emily gave me a choice--

163
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:30,392
You do have a choice!

164
00:11:30,935 --> 00:11:34,063
Why are you listening to her?
Are you crazy?

165
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,470
lt's not right what Emily wants
you to do. She's totally--

166
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:41,807
Stop pinching me!

167
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:46,681
You guys said to keep my mouth shut
if Ross was happy, right?

168
00:11:47,585 --> 00:11:51,021
He just told me
that he's not entirely happy.

169
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:54,180
What's going on?

170
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,085
We all hate Emily!

171
00:11:59,464 --> 00:12:01,762
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily.

172
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:05,000
We just think that
you're having to sacrifice...

173
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,170
...a whole lot to make her happy.

174
00:12:09,374 --> 00:12:13,470
We just think that maybe
she's being a little unreasonable.

175
00:12:13,711 --> 00:12:15,645
Yes, unreasonable.

176
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:17,945
Unreasonable?

177
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:21,712
How about we have this conversation
when one of you marries?

178
00:12:22,553 --> 00:12:25,886
You have no idea what it takes
to make a marriage work.

179
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:28,718
lt's compromise.
Do you always like it? No.

180
00:12:28,993 --> 00:12:30,017
Do you do it? Yes.

181
00:12:30,228 --> 00:12:33,561
Because it's not all laughing,
happy, candy in the sky...

182
00:12:33,798 --> 00:12:35,356
...coffee at Central Perk.

183
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:37,032
lt's real life, okay?

184
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:40,463
lt's what grownups do.

185
00:12:47,011 --> 00:12:48,239
l think he's right.

186
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,974
You guys hang out at
the coffeehouse way too much.

187
00:12:57,722 --> 00:13:00,657
-l feel so guilty about Ross.
-l know.

188
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:03,524
l kind of feel like it's my fault.

189
00:13:06,164 --> 00:13:07,495
Kind of?

190
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,726
You should have kept this to yourself.

191
00:13:11,102 --> 00:13:16,039
l'm keeping so many things to myself,
something was bound to slip out!

192
00:13:17,508 --> 00:13:19,999
l think it's very brave
what you said.

193
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,911
l can't sit here anymore.
l have to walk places.

194
00:13:26,217 --> 00:13:29,345
What's with the coat?
How about the animal rights thing?

195
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:33,213
l've been reading up,
and for your information...

196
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:35,288
...minks aren't very nice.

197
00:13:36,928 --> 00:13:42,491
-So they deserve to be killed?
-Well, they are real bad.

198
00:13:44,335 --> 00:13:46,997
Okay, l admit it.
l love this coat, okay?

199
00:13:47,205 --> 00:13:51,608
lt's the best thing l ever had wrapped
around me, including Phil Huntley.

200
00:13:52,877 --> 00:13:55,505
Remember Phil Huntley?
He was fine.

201
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:13,254
So you like the short hair better?

202
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:18,228
Yeti? Danny?

203
00:14:20,204 --> 00:14:22,798
l had to cut my hair to get rid of...

204
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:24,708
...the fogger smell.

205
00:14:25,743 --> 00:14:29,372
Listen, l'm so sorry.
l would have never fogged you...

206
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,980
...if you hadn't looked so....

207
00:14:33,451 --> 00:14:36,887
Absolutely. Some people
are just into appearances.

208
00:14:37,288 --> 00:14:38,277
What?

209
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:39,578
lt's cool.

210
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,422
No, that is not cool.

211
00:14:42,627 --> 00:14:44,094
You don't even know me.

212
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:47,263
You got the shopping bags
and the Saks catalog.

213
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:51,427
From that, you've got me
all figured out?

214
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,131
Well, you don't.

215
00:14:53,337 --> 00:14:57,637
You know, l could have toys
for underprivileged kids in here.

216
00:14:58,609 --> 00:14:59,735
Do you?

217
00:15:00,111 --> 00:15:03,672
You know, if kids like to play
with capri pants.

218
00:15:07,318 --> 00:15:09,411
Stop saying that.
l hate that!

219
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,668
l judged you.
l made a snap judgment.

220
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:29,135
But you did it too, and you're worse.
You're sticking to your judgment.

221
00:15:29,373 --> 00:15:32,774
You can't even open your mind to see
you might be wrong.

222
00:15:32,977 --> 00:15:34,467
What does that say about you?

223
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:38,140
That pizza place
across the street any good?

224
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,284
l'm hungry.
You want some pizza?

225
00:15:41,486 --> 00:15:42,953
You can keep yelling.

226
00:15:47,024 --> 00:15:49,549
Stop saying that.
l hate that.

227
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:57,657
Are you still mad?

228
00:15:57,902 --> 00:16:00,370
Good! We have an ''l'm Sorry'' song.

229
00:16:00,638 --> 00:16:02,629
You know what?
l'm not in the mood.

230
00:16:03,641 --> 00:16:05,233
Look, Ross.

231
00:16:06,043 --> 00:16:10,207
l feel really bad.
You're going through all this stuff...

232
00:16:10,414 --> 00:16:12,575
...and l just acted like a jerk.

233
00:16:12,817 --> 00:16:16,719
-We are so sorry.
-You're stepping on the song.

234
00:16:17,822 --> 00:16:21,485
We were way out of line, all right?
We totally support you.

235
00:16:21,726 --> 00:16:23,751
Whatever you decide,
whatever you do.

236
00:16:24,228 --> 00:16:27,061
Now you're just taking lines
out of the song.

237
00:16:27,532 --> 00:16:32,162
This is hard enough, okay?
l really need you guys right now.

238
00:16:32,403 --> 00:16:35,497
Yes, exactly! And that's why....

239
00:16:36,774 --> 00:16:41,268
Why don't you come over tonight,
and l'll make your favorite dinner.

240
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:46,546
Thanks, you guys.

241
00:16:47,184 --> 00:16:48,674
Are you wearing fur?

242
00:16:48,886 --> 00:16:50,911
Let's get some perspective, people.

243
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:54,421
lt's not like l'm wearing
a seeing-eye dog coat!

244
00:16:57,728 --> 00:17:02,791
You know, l think l kind of
understand why l lost it today.

245
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:04,791
You do, huh?

246
00:17:05,036 --> 00:17:06,025
You see...

247
00:17:06,203 --> 00:17:07,966
...l'm an actor, right?

248
00:17:08,472 --> 00:17:12,203
So l got to keep my emotions
right at the surface.

249
00:17:12,777 --> 00:17:15,769
l got a lot of balls in the air,
you know?

250
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:22,611
lt's tough. Guys like me,
you wander around, you're alone.

251
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:26,083
What are you talking about?

252
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:29,052
l'm not sure.

253
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:33,124
Look at you!
Where have you been?

254
00:17:33,397 --> 00:17:35,058
l went to have pizza.

255
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:36,756
With Danny.

256
00:17:37,602 --> 00:17:41,129
-What happened?
-That yeti is one smooth talker.

257
00:17:41,772 --> 00:17:44,741
Yetis are smooth-talkers. That's why
you never see any pictures of them.

258
00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:47,776
''Come here, baby. Give me the camera.''

259
00:17:49,113 --> 00:17:51,911
l hope you're not full.
Dinner's almost ready.

260
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:55,244
l think l'll probably
just hang out in my room.

261
00:17:55,453 --> 00:17:56,442
Why?

262
00:17:56,754 --> 00:17:57,846
Come on, you guys!

263
00:17:58,255 --> 00:18:02,157
lf Emily knew l was having dinner
with you, she'd flip out.

264
00:18:04,428 --> 00:18:07,158
lt's okay.
l really don't mind.

265
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:10,264
Wait, wait. You know what?
Just stay.

266
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:12,163
Please.

267
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:15,037
lt would mean a lot for me
if you stay.

268
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:17,596
Ross, l just--

269
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:21,300
Please, just have dinner with us!

270
00:18:22,947 --> 00:18:24,471
Settle down.

271
00:18:24,682 --> 00:18:27,150
All right. l'm sorry.

272
00:18:27,385 --> 00:18:29,444
You see, Rach, l'm an actor.

273
00:18:34,225 --> 00:18:37,023
Hey, look!
Ugly Naked Guy's back.

274
00:18:39,463 --> 00:18:41,158
We haven't seen him in so long.

275
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:44,857
Oh, God! l really missed
that fat bastard.

276
00:18:49,006 --> 00:18:50,303
This is so weird.

277
00:18:50,508 --> 00:18:54,239
l realized this may be
the last time we hang out together.

278
00:18:55,246 --> 00:18:57,214
lt's almost as if he knew.

279
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:01,383
l'll get it.

280
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,823
Hi, Emily.

281
00:19:09,894 --> 00:19:11,885
You tracked him down.
Hold on.

282
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:18,929
Yeah, we're just having dinner.

283
00:19:20,438 --> 00:19:22,030
Sure, hold on.

284
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,763
She wants to say hi.

285
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:28,237
Hi, Emily!

286
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:29,945
Hello, everyone.

287
00:19:30,181 --> 00:19:32,240
So who am l saying hello to?

288
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:35,280
Well, l don't know
about who's here...

289
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,216
...but l can tell you who's not here,
and that's Rachel!

290
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:45,353
<i>I should hope not.</i>
<i>Ross knows better than that by now.</i>

291
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:51,425
You know what?
Rachel is here.

292
00:19:51,802 --> 00:19:53,360
<i>She's there?</i>

293
00:19:53,571 --> 00:19:55,596
Oh, yeah, there she is!

294
00:19:57,308 --> 00:19:59,242
She's here.

295
00:19:59,477 --> 00:20:01,240
Take me off speakerphone.

296
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,405
How could you do this to me?

297
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,917
l made my feelings about Rachel
perfectly clear.

298
00:20:09,153 --> 00:20:13,146
l'm just having dinner
with my friends, okay?

299
00:20:13,491 --> 00:20:17,655
-You can't keep away from her.
-That's ridiculous.

300
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:21,062
-Hello? Hello?
-Who is this?

301
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:24,833
lt's Ross. What are you doing?

302
00:20:25,002 --> 00:20:27,368
Sorry, dude, l had to make a call.

303
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:30,367
Joey.

304
00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:39,073
Joey, they don't have two lines,
they have two phones.

305
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,415
Gotcha.

306
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:48,015
l'm sorry. Emily, listen.
l have never cheated on you.

307
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:52,356
l'm moving for you. l'm cutting
friends out of my life for you.

308
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,896
Please, get on the plane
and come to New York, okay?

309
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:59,534
<i>You're the only one</i>
<i>I want to be with.</i>

310
00:20:59,804 --> 00:21:04,002
l'll feel better when l'm there.
l can know where you are all the time.

311
00:21:07,244 --> 00:21:10,042
You can't know where l am
all the time.

312
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:15,511
This marriage will never work
if you don't trust me.

313
00:21:17,555 --> 00:21:18,715
You're right.

314
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:23,754
Can you trust me?

315
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,167
l think it's going okay.

316
00:21:35,906 --> 00:21:37,168
Looks like he's smiling.

317
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:40,241
How can you tell?
You can only see his back.

318
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:42,669
You can totally tell!

319
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,547
Here, look, watch me.

320
00:21:45,683 --> 00:21:46,672
Smile.

321
00:21:46,884 --> 00:21:48,408
Frown. Smile.

322
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:50,045
Frown.

323
00:21:50,254 --> 00:21:51,346
Smile.

324
00:22:05,302 --> 00:22:06,735
l guess that's it.

325
00:22:07,271 --> 00:22:09,205
Why? What happened?

326
00:22:10,074 --> 00:22:11,939
My marriage is over.

327
00:22:14,645 --> 00:22:17,136
Look at you, you're shivering.

328
00:22:18,115 --> 00:22:19,446
Here.

329
00:22:23,721 --> 00:22:25,882
Honey, is there anything we can do?

330
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:33,594
You can help me
get my furniture back from Gunther.

331
00:22:53,017 --> 00:22:55,383
Stop tormenting me!

332
00:22:56,921 --> 00:23:01,085
This is mink, okay? They're mean,
and they hate squirrels.

333
00:23:01,358 --> 00:23:04,350
Most of these probably
wanted to be coats.

334
00:23:06,697 --> 00:23:08,426
Fine. No, l get it.

335
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:09,655
Here.

336
00:23:10,334 --> 00:23:11,323
You take it.

337
00:23:12,403 --> 00:23:14,667
Are you happy now?
l'm cold!

338
00:23:16,273 --> 00:23:17,262
