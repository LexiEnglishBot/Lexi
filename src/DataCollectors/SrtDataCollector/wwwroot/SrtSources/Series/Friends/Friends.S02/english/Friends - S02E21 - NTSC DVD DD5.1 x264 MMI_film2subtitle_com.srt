1
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,569
Why are we watching
the Business Channel?

2
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:11,073
Because the other day I saw there was
a stock with my initials, MEG, on it.

3
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,040
Sometimes it takes two or three hours
before it comes up again.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,214
But when it does, it's exciting.

5
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,346
Okay, honey, you really need a job.

6
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:24,152
Dad says he knows someone
you can call for an interview.

7
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:28,020
Right there! That's the third
sign today. Right there.

8
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:32,393
On behalf of everyone,
I'd just like to say, "Huh?"

9
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:36,566
No, you just said "dad."
And everywhere I go today...

10
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,328
...I keep getting signs
telling me to go see my father.

11
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:42,837
Like when I was walking over here
and I passed a buffet.

12
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,245
Which is my father's last name.

13
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,178
And they were serving franks...

14
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,386
...which is his first name
minus the "s" at the end.

15
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:58,521
And there was a rotisserie
with a spinning chicken.

16
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,726
His Indian name?

17
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:05,997
No. Because I chickened out
the last time...

18
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:10,260
...when I tried to meet him.
So coincidences? I don't think so.

19
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,698
- Very freaky.
- Eerie.

20
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,701
Who wants the last hamburger?

21
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,067
That's it.
Now I have to go see him.

22
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:18,341
Why?

23
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,138
Hamburger? McDonald's?

24
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,749
Old McDonald had a farm.
My dad is a pharmacist.

25
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:32,747
And ei ei oh, It's what your mom
said when you father left you.

26
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,361
Yes! Really? No!

27
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:42,867
The One With the Bullies

28
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,337
Man, I am so beat.

29
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,506
You wanna forget racquetball
and hang out?

30
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,216
Yeah, all right.

31
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,752
- Hey, you're in our seats.
- Sorry, we didn't know.

32
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,481
We were sitting there.

33
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,924
Okay.
There is one more way to say it.

34
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,687
Who knows it?

35
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:50,802
- Was that supposed to be funny?
- Actually, I was going for colorful.

36
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,434
- What's with this guy?
- What's with you?

37
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,698
Nothing. Nothing's with him.

38
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,408
Enjoy your coffee.

39
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,874
What just happened?

40
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,753
I just took your hat.
See, I can be funny too.

41
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,925
My joke is that I took your hat.

42
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,287
That is funny.

43
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:18,452
Can I have it back?

44
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,837
You know what?
I think you're very funny.

45
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,601
Kudos on that hat joke.

46
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,882
But come on, guys,
just give him back the hat.

47
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:39,416
Why should we?

48
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,621
Because it's a special hat.

49
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,554
He bought it because
he was feeling down one day.

50
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,021
So he got the hat...

51
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,592
...to cheer himself up, you know?

52
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,395
- Chandler
- Stop talking. Stop talking now.

53
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,500
Let me get this straight.
You're stealing my hat?

54
00:03:58,838 --> 00:03:59,736
You got a problem?

55
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,803
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

56
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,770
I'm telling you Rach, I've gone
dead hunting with Phabby before.

57
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:12,050
It's a very scary thing for her,
and she is very vunlerable.

58
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,056
That's why we are there.
You know, be supported or crap.

59
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,060
Ok, will you just let me
know when to do witch.

60
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,125
How'd the interview go?

61
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:27,590
It bit.

62
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,936
It was a 50s theme restaurant.

63
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,707
I'd have to cook in a costume
and dance on the counter.

64
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,634
I was a sous chef
at Cafe des Artistes.

65
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:41,836
How can I take a job where I have
to make Laverne-and-Curly Fries?

66
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,313
- Don't do it.
- How can I not do it?

67
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,313
I have $127 in the bank!

68
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,520
Monica, relax. Go get a beer.

69
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,018
I don't want a beer.

70
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,690
Who said it was for you?

71
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,729
What's the matter?

72
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,063
Some mean guys at the coffeehouse
took my hat.

73
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,067
- No!
- You're kidding?

74
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,742
It was ridiculous.
These guys were bullies.

75
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,911
Actual bullies.

76
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:17,048
We're grownups. This kind of stuff
isn't supposed to happen anymore.

77
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,611
Oh, no, wait a minute.
I have no one.

78
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,950
Let's go down there
and get your hat back.

79
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:33,356
Forget it. It's probably stripped
and sold for parts by now.

80
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,497
- I went up!
- What?

81
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,001
My stock, MEG, it went up two points.

82
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:45,438
Do you realize that if I'd invested
my $127 in myself yesterday...

83
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,409
...that I'd, like, have
a lot more than that today.

84
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,412
You know what?
I'm going to do it.

85
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,580
- Do what?
- Put all my money in me.

86
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,620
You don't know a thing
about the stock market.

87
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,952
What's to know?
Buy, sell. High, low. Bears, bulls.

88
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,423
Yes, Manhattan.

89
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,424
Telephone number for the stock...

90
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,696
...selling store.

91
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,043
See? I told you these pillows
would be a good idea.

92
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:23,807
Oh, God.

93
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,843
Here we go.

94
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,580
For the first time in my life,
I'm gonna say, "Hi, Birth Father!"

95
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,149
- We love you. We're here for you.
- Good luck.

96
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,585
Thanks.

97
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,897
Hey, Rach, you want some sandwich?

98
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,657
What is in that?

99
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,029
Olive loaf and ham spread. No mayo.

100
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,171
No, because mayo,
that would make it gross.

101
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,836
- Run, Phoebe, run!
- No, no, doggy, please!

102
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,608
I do so want to love all animals.
Please, no. Back off!

103
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,943
- You got a bone?
- Are you kidding?

104
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,348
Look, kibbles! Bits!

105
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:07,520
Get the hell off my leg,
you yippity piece of crap!

106
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,066
Okay. All right. We have a problem.

107
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,171
Why don't you take his trampoline?

108
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,775
Okay, here, I know what we can do.

109
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,203
Okay, doggy, get the sandwich!

110
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:32,172
Go get the sandwich!
Good doggy. Get the sandwich!

111
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:36,413
The dog will lick himself
but he will not touch your sandwich.

112
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,155
What does that tell you?

113
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,822
- Lf he's not going to eat it, I will.
- Are you crazy?

114
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,689
He's just a little dog.

115
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,096
- Hey.
- What?

116
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:56,136
Do you have to be a Century 21
real-estate agent...

117
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,673
...to get to wear those cool jackets?

118
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,509
Do you say this stuff to girls?

119
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,279
Isn't that the guy
who used to wear your hat?

120
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,352
And look where they're sitting.

121
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,660
You're joking, right?
You guys just walked through the door.

122
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,160
Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.

123
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,994
This couch belongs to us.

124
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,330
I'll tell you what,
you call the couch...

125
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,305
...and then we'll call the couch...

126
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,343
...and we'll see who it comes to.

127
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:42,310
You know what I don't like you.
You always got something to say.

128
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,422
You know, I keep wondering
why you two are still sitting here.

129
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:51,960
All right, that's it.

130
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,661
I have had enough of this.

131
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,166
Gunther.

132
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,332
These guys are trying
to take our seat.

133
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,769
Fellas, these guys were here first.

134
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,840
Oh, sorry, didn't realize.

135
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,301
There you go.

136
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,481
Thank you, Gunther.

137
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:15,146
We didn't want to have
to go and do that.

138
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,813
He told on us?

139
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,517
You told on us?

140
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:23,023
Well, pal, you didn't
give me much of a choice.

141
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,794
- Don't play with his thing.
- I know.

142
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,167
All right.

143
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,832
Let's take this outside.

144
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,471
"Let's take this outside?"

145
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,074
Who talks like that?

146
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,682
The guy who's about to kick your ass
talks like that.

147
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,511
You had to ask.

148
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,624
Okay, okay, look. See...

149
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,864
...the thing is, we're not gonna
fight you guys.

150
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,293
Here's the deal.

151
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:07,438
You won't have to, so long as you
never ever show your faces here again.

152
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,608
I think you played
the Gunther card too soon.

153
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,184
Hey, Pheebs, I think you're good to go.

154
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,084
Yeah, I don't know.

155
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,219
What's the matter?

156
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,260
I just think that this was
a really bad sign.

157
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:35,523
Like the beast at the threshold.

158
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:41,870
It's just I have no family left,
except for my grandmother.

159
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,076
But let's face it, she's not
gonna be around forever.

160
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,743
Despite what she says.

161
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:53,316
And I have a sister who I've barely
spoken to since we shared a womb.

162
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,688
I don't know. This is my real father...

163
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:00,288
...and I want things to be,
like, just right.

164
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,117
I completely understand.

165
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,520
Whatever you need.

166
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,860
Hey, you want to go home?

167
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,396
Okay, thanks. Sorry, again.

168
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,448
What was that?

169
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,625
I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.

170
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,433
I want to buy five shares of SGJ.
Now.

171
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,003
Come on, time is money, my friend!

172
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:49,431
Thank you!

173
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,277
"Time is money, my friend?"

174
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,605
You missed "Takes
money to make money"...

175
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:59,716
...and "Don't make me come down there
and kick your Wall Street butt."

176
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,753
I made $ 17 before breakfast.
What have you done?

177
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:07,584
I had breakfast here,
so technically I saved $3.50.

178
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,494
How did you make $17?

179
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,994
Well, my financially
challenged friends...

180
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:16,563
...I split my money and I bought
some shares of CHP and ZXY.

181
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,730
How come those?

182
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:23,498
Well, CHP because I used to have a
crush on Erik Estrada.

183
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,077
And ZXY because I think
it sounds "zexy."

184
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,981
What happened to MEG?

185
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,650
MEG was good for me, but I dumped her.

186
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:37,012
My motto is, "Get out
before they go down."

187
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,291
That is so not my motto.

188
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:48,991
How's the dog?

189
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:52,702
Okay. I talked to the vet.
People are so nice upstate.

190
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:56,567
He said the little fella's gonna be
okay, and I can get him tomorrow.

191
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,401
- Good.
- Thank God.

192
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:01,374
But he did have to have
a bunch of stitches.

193
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,550
And he said that only once in a blue
moon does a dog's ear grow back.

194
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,312
So still hoping.

195
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:15,557
Now are you going to call your dad
to let him know that his dog is okay?

196
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:19,397
I don't want to meet my father
over the phone.

197
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,223
What will I say,
"Hi, I'm the daughter you abandoned.

198
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,002
Oh, by the way, I broke your dog."

199
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,606
Hey, Pheebs, if you want, I'll do it.

200
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:34,168
Listen, just don't say anything
about me, okay?

201
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:35,914
Don't...

202
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,018
...be too long with the phone.

203
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,048
She'll be a much better friend
once the market closes.

204
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:47,855
It's a woman.

205
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,522
So talk to her.

206
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,429
Hello, Mrs. Buffay.

207
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,466
I know where your dog is.

208
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,866
I want you to know he'll be returned
to you almost as good as new...

209
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,939
...within 24 hours.

210
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,611
Goodbye.

211
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,511
- Why the voice?
- Hard to say.

212
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,554
Your cappuccino, sir.

213
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,056
Thank you.

214
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,933
- This is better than the coffeehouse.
- Absolutely.

215
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,445
How come it's not mixing
with the water?

216
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,114
The package says to keep it moving.

217
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,682
Stir and drink, never let it settle.

218
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,088
This is ridiculous.

219
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:57,022
After I get back from
my niece's christening...

220
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:01,665
...I'll go to the coffeehouse with
you and we'll have a cup of coffee.

221
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,334
No problem. Joey's there.

222
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:14,311
I don't want to have to have Joey with
me every time I want decent coffee.

223
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,081
And I don't want to drink
cappuccino with a "k."

224
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,410
I say you and I go
and stand up to those guys.

225
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,121
All right, hang on
a second there, Custer.

226
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,125
Ross, have you ever
been beaten up before?

227
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,292
Yeah, sure.

228
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:32,253
By someone besides Monica?

229
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,429
So what?

230
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:38,660
So we get beaten up. Maybe that's
something a man has to go through.

231
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,873
Like a rite of passage or something.

232
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:45,176
Couldn't we just lose
our virginities again?

233
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,108
Because I think actually
mine's growing back.

234
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,083
Are you go with me or not. Come on.

235
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:58,045
All right, I'm go with you. Just prepare
clean underware for the hospital.

236
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,954
- I need $100.
- What?

237
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,787
Welcome home.

238
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,864
- I need $100.
- For what?

239
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,601
- To get back in the game.
- When did you get out?

240
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,566
I lost it all. I lost it.

241
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,170
I've come to terms with it,
you have to, too.

242
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,478
Look, Mon, I'm really sorry.

243
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,377
Where are we on the $100?

244
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:26,777
I don't have it.

245
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,577
But I need it!

246
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,855
Otherwise, I'll have to
take that diner job.

247
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:36,255
You know, with the dancing
and the costumes.

248
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,593
I don't want to have to wear
flame-retardant boobs.

249
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,261
Nobody does, honey.

250
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:51,470
Noodle!

251
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:56,113
Oh, my God. What the hell
happened to my dog?

252
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,474
It was an accident.

253
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,982
And the woman who did this
would never hurt a dog on purpose.

254
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,847
She's a vegetarian.

255
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,349
Are these stitches?

256
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:09,185
Yeah, eight of them.
That's 56 to him.

257
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,825
If it's raining, you can't
let him look up...

258
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,293
...because that cone
will fill up fast.

259
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,863
Thanks for bringing back
what's left of him.

260
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:22,198
- Is Frank home?
- How do you know Frank?

261
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,467
Just from a long time ago.
Is he here?

262
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,283
What?

263
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,785
I mean Frank Senior.

264
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,716
He went out for groceries.

265
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,218
Will he be back soon?

266
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,058
He left four years ago.
We're expecting him back any minute.

267
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,523
I'm gonna go.

268
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,063
I'm sorry about the dog.
Everything.

269
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,357
I'm sorry.

270
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,160
Hey, lady!

271
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,265
Hey, wait up!

272
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:02,538
- How do you know my dad?
- Well, I don't really.

273
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,511
Just genetically.

274
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,315
He's kind of my dad too.

275
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:09,821
Heavy.

276
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,988
So did he ever talk about me... Phoebe?

277
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,753
No, but he didn't really talk
about anything.

278
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,591
Except stilts.

279
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,093
- Stilts?
- Yeah, he loved stilts.

280
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:30,274
One time, I was upstairs stealing
cigarettes out of my mom's purse...

281
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,241
...and all of a sudden I look over...

282
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,310
...and there's Dad's head,
bobbing past the window.

283
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,119
He just had this big smile on his face
and he was waving...

284
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,218
...because he was happiest
when he was on his stilts.

285
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,794
I don't know what to do with that.

286
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,528
Me neither.

287
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,402
So are you, like, my big sister?

288
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,100
This is huge. You can buy me beer!

289
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,400
I'm not gonna.

290
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:09,340
But you know what's cool? If you had
a friend named Pete, I could say...

291
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,139
..."I know Pete.
He's friends with my brother."

292
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,751
- I got a friend named Mark.
- That'll work too.

293
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:16,817
Cool. All right.

294
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:21,983
So maybe, you know,
I could give you a call sometime.

295
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,553
We could talk or something.

296
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,094
- Yeah, that'd be okay.
- All right.

297
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,959
I'm in the book.

298
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,607
So stilts, huh?

299
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:40,675
If you want, I can show you where
he hit his head on the rain gutter.

300
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:49,318
We did it. We're here.
We are standing our ground.

301
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,322
- How long does coffee take?
- Would you come on? Come on!

302
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,487
Thank you.

303
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,407
- There we go.
- I think we proved our point.

304
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,340
- You burn your mouth?
- Cannot feel my tongue.

305
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,543
Bullies! Big bullies!

306
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,283
Look who's here.
It's the weenies.

307
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,689
Did we not make ourselves clear
the other day?

308
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,294
That's why we're here.

309
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,828
Yes, we're standing our ground.

310
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,231
Apparently.

311
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,093
Let's do this already.

312
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,393
You got a weapon?

313
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,371
A nice watch.
I don't want to break it on your ribs.

314
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,838
All right, let's do this.

315
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:52,208
Question: If I don't care about
my watch, can I use it as a weapon?

316
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,576
- What do you mean?
- It's sharp, it's metal.

317
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,684
I think I can do some
serious damage with it.

318
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,254
No, you can't use your watch.

319
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,588
Or your keys.

320
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,761
Here's what we'll do.

321
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,534
We'll put all keys and watches
in the hat over there.

322
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:10,957
All right?

323
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,473
All right, come on, man. Let's do it!

324
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:19,265
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?

325
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,374
Of course. Why wouldn't you hit faces?

326
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:24,844
I have to work on Monday.
I have a big presentation.

327
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,053
Actually, I gotta show
this apartment tomorrow...

328
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:32,586
...and this no-faces thing
might not be a bad idea.

329
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:35,189
Nothing from the neck up.

330
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,789
Or the waist down.

331
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,598
- Dana's ovulating.
- Really? You guys trying again?

332
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,995
Let me get this straight.
We're talking about the middle?

333
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,136
Come on!

334
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,169
You want a piece of this?
I'm standing here!

335
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,014
Those guys are taking our stuff!

336
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:03,250
God, that was amazing.
That was incredible.

337
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,389
- You guys kicked butt!
- Us? What about you guys?

338
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,389
You really gave it to
old Mr. Clean back there.

339
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,391
- He was a big guy.
- Yeah, he was, wasn't he?

340
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,599
I wouldn't know,
having missed everything.

341
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,958
Don't do that to yourself.

342
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:21,002
Any one of us could have tripped
over that little girl's jump rope.

343
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,868
So listen, guys...

344
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,540
...are we okay here?

345
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:31,940
We're okay.

346
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,246
So can I have my hat back?

347
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,733
Oh, my God. Look at her.

348
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,737
Hi, Monica!

349
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,401
How's it going?

350
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,041
Hey, nice boobs.

351
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,309
Guys, guys. Check this out.

352
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:22,923
Excellent.
