00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:04,336
- Phoebe.
- Yeah?

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,381
Look at that guy by the window. Wow!

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:11,552
He's awfully short.
And I think he's talking to himself.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,596
And to be completely honest,
he's not that good in bed.

5
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:20,561
Ugh, what is wrong with me lately?
It's, like, every guy I see.

6
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,688
Look at that guy, for example.

7
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:26,066
Normally that's not someone
that I would be attracted to.

8
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:28,110
But right now,
with the way I'm feeling...

9
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:32,448
...all I wanna do is rip off
his sweatpants and fanny pack.

10
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:36,869
Wait a second! This is about
the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,996
- Yeah.
- This is completely normal.

12
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,665
Around the fourth month,
your hormones go crazy.

13
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:45,044
- Really? So this happened to you?
- Absolutely, yeah.

14
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,671
And keep in mind, I was carrying triplets.

15
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:52,217
So in medical terms,
I was thrice as randy.

16
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,137
Wow, this explains so much.

17
00:00:55,305 --> 00:01:00,184
Last weekend, I went from store
to store, sitting on Santas' laps.

18
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,270
Yeah, I remember trying to steal...

19
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,398
...a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield
from a Footlocker.

20
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,984
- Ugh.
- Yeah, ugh.

21
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,987
I go see my doctor tomorrow.
I'll ask her about this.

22
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,239
Maybe she can give me
a pill or something.

23
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,909
Yeah, that's what you need.
A good pill.

24
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,324
- Hey.
- Hey.

25
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,909
- Hey.
- Hi.

26
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,953
Look, I got our pictures developed.

27
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,706
Oh, great. Joey, wanna check out
pictures of me and Mona ice-skating?

28
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:11,130
Oh, uh, ordinarily I would love to,
but I am just swamped right now.

29
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:19,388
Where are the pictures that creepy
pretzel vendor took of us together?

30
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,015
Oh, yeah. Probably at the end.

31
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:26,311
Oh, my God. All he took
were pictures of my breasts!

32
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,230

33

- Okay, here's a good one of us.
- Wow, that is a good one.

35
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,204
Wow, It looks like a holiday card...

36
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:48,292
...with the tree in the middle
and the skaters and the snow. Heh.

37
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,086
Every year I say I'll send cards
and I never do it.

38
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,714
Do you wanna send
this one out together?

39
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,638
Together? Like, to people?

40
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:05,559
Yeah, "Happy Holidays,
from Mona and Ross." lt'll be cute. Okay?

41

Heh. Uh, okay.

I know. Can you believe that?

47
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,412
I'm sorry. What's the big deal
about a holiday card?

48
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,249
Married couples send out cards.
Families send out cards.

49
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:33,629
People who've been dating a few months
do not send out cards. Is she crazy?

Hey, hey, hey.
That's your wife you're talking about.

- Bing! Ho, and the Bingette!
- Ah, heh.

- Honey, you remember my boss, Doug.
- Yes. Hi.

53

So, good news, the divorce is final.
I signed the papers this a.m.

54
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,022
I didn't know you were getting
a divorce. I'm sorry.

55
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,359
Heh, sorry? Finally chewed my leg out
of that bear trap.

56
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:01,365
- Hey! Congratulations to you guys.
- Heh. No leg-chewing for us.

57
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,200
Well, give it time.

58
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:08,622
So! The divorce, the marriage,
we got a lot to celebrate.

How about we go out to dinner
tomorrow night?

60
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,336
I can't think
of anything we're doing.

61

Why can't I think of anything
we're doing?

62

Tomorrow night it is.
I should be out of court by 6.

out of the park! Ha-ha-ha.

Okay, see you tomorrow.

Just so you know,
we're not seeing him tomorrow.

67
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,106
I cannot spend another evening
with that man.

68
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,275
Remember how he behaved
at our wedding?

69
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,694
- No.
- Because he wasn't invited.

70
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,905
Because of the way he behaved
at our engagement party.

an ice sculpture, doesn't it?

Now, do you think it should say,
"Love, Ross and Mona"?

Well, we haven't said that
to each other yet...

to say it to other people.

- A hundred? Ha-ha-ha.

about the whole, uh, card thing.
