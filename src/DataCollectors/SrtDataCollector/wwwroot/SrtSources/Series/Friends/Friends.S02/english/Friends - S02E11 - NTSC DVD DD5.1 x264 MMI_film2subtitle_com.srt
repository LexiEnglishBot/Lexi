1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:03,997
Okay, here's his diaper bag...

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:07,039
...and his Mr. Winky.

3
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:08,696
And...

4
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:11,265
...him. Hi!

5
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,604
- How did everything go?
- Great!

6
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:16,973
There was a projectile...

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,041
...throwing up incident,
but he started it.

8
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,414
We've gotta go.

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,182
Oh, right.

10
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,325
I've got some news.
It's about us.

11
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:29,391
You and me?

12
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,596
No. Susan and me.

13
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,526
The other "us."

14
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,561
We're getting married.

15
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:48,872
As in, "I now pronounce you
wife and wife" married?

16
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:53,341
We'd like you to come.
We understand if you don't want to.

17
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,681
Why wouldn't I want to come?
I had fun at the first wedding.

18
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,186
I just thought that

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,420
Why shouldn't I be happy for you?
What would it say about me...

20
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,725
...if I couldn't revel
in your joy?

21
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:11,402
And I'm reveling, baby!
Believe me!

22
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,098
Is your finger caught in that chair?

23
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:17,809
Want us to go?

24
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:25,815
The One With the Lesbian Wedding

25
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,657
This is cool.
You're actually on television.

26
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,898
I know.
It really hit me last night.

27
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,866
I'm on Days of our Lives.

28
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:21,735
Then I started thinking about us, and
how these are the days of our lives.

29
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,240
Yes!

30
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,240
What?

31
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,281
Carol and Susan's caterer
had a bike accident...

32
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,575
...and she's in a
full-body cast.

33
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:38,356
They want me to do it, which is cool
since I've never catered...

34
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,258
...and I need the money.
Is this a problem for you, isn't it?

35
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,586
- Would it matter?
- You're so great!

36
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,057
Thank you!

37
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,789
- You're really not going?
- I'm really not.

38
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,763
They already live together.
Why do they need to get married?

39
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,605
They love each other.

40
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,401
They wanna celebrate that love
with the people close to them.

41
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,272
If you wanna call
that a reason.

42
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,678
Who's the bitterest
man in the living room?

43
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,783
The bitterest man
in the living room?

44
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,356
Hi, neighbor.

45
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:16,953
- I thought you were over this.
- That has nothing to do with it.

46
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,825
She is my ex-wife, If she were marrying
a guy, you wouldn't expect me to go.

47
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,831
If she were marrying a guy,
she'd be the worst lesbian ever.

48
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,239
Did I miss it?

49
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,638
No, I'm on right after this guy
shoots himself.

50
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:34,943
She's pretty.

51
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,147
And she's really nice.

52
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,251
She taught me about
how to work with the cameras...

53
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,317
...and smell-the-fart acting.

54
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,222
- I'm sorry, what?
- Excuse me?

55
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,992
Smell-the-fart acting

56
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,193
You got so many lines
to learn so fast that sometimes...

57
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,026
...you need a minute
to remember your next one.

58
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,765
So while you're thinking...

59
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,442
...you take this big pause
where you look all intense.

60
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:04,665
Like this...

61
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,649
Here's my scene!
Here's my scene!

62
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:17,456
Mrs. Wallace?

63
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,757
Dr. Drake Ramoray,
your sister's neurosurgeon.

64
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,086
Is she going to be all right?

65
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:27,163
I'm afraid the situation
is much more dire than we'd expected.

66
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,697
Your sister's suffering from a...

67
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,666
...subcranial hematoma.

68
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:43,345
Perhaps we can
discuss this further over coffee.

69
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:50,544
Nice!

70
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,717
For a minute, I thought you were
actually smelling something.

71
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,963
- Do it again!
- All right!

72
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,429
- That was so good!
- Do it again.

73
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,167
"Damn it, Braverman!
It's right there on the chart!"

74
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:11,776
I gotta get to work.
I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.

75
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,034
No, that's me.

76
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,541
Oh, right.

77
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,713
Oh, thanks. Couldn't...

78
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:24,814
Is everything okay?

79
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:26,650
No.

80
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:32,494
One of my clients died
on the massage table today.

81
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,096
Oh, my God!

82
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,693
That's a little more relaxed
than you want them to get.

83
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,867
She was, you know,
82 years old...

84
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:46,437
...and her name was
Mrs. Adelman.

85
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,475
Oh, honey.

86
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,271
It's just so strange. You know...

87
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,178
...she probably woke up
this morning and thought...

88
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:57,116
...I'll have some breakfast, take
a walk, then have my massage.

89
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,518
Little did she know God thought,
"Okay, but that's it."

90
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,027
Oh, but the weirdest things was...

91
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:10,497
...I was cleansing her aura
when it happened.

92
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,398
And when her spirit
left her body...

93
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,834
...I don't think it went very far.

94
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:17,932
What do you mean?

95
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,244
I think it went into me.

96
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,216
This is so hard.

97
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,482
I can't decide
between lamb or duck.

98
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,387
Well, lambs are scarier.

99
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,960
Otherwise the movie would've been
called silence of the Ducks.

100
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,156
Okay, who ordered what?

101
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:46,700
I had the half-drunk cappuccino
with the lipstick on the rim.

102
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,605
And this with the cigarette
butt in it, is that decaf?

103
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,435
Oh, God.

104
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,771
You're so uptight
about your mom coming.

105
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:58,245
I know. I just don't want
her to think that because...

106
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,986
...I didn't marry Barry
my life is total crap.

107
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,018
Talk about crap, just
listen to Stella Neidman...

108
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,521
...tell her story about Rod Steiger
for the hundredth time.

109
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:17,525
I'm sorry. At least you guys haven't
need to hear staff she said in my head.

110
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,633
Pheebs? How long do you think
this lady will be with us?

111
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,345
I don't know. She obviously
has some unfinished business.

112
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,581
Sit up!

113
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,111
There she is!

114
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,115
- Mom!
- Hey, sweetie!

115
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,896
So this is where you work!

116
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,324
Oh, it's wonderful!

117
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:51,569
Is it a living room?
Is it a restaurant? Who can tell?

118
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,832
I guess that's the fun.

119
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,074
Pretty much.
Here, meet my friends.

120
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,243
Monica! You look gorgeous!

121
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,711
Oh, my! The last time I saw you,
it was eat or be eaten.

122
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,051
This is Joey.

123
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,343
This is Phoebe.

124
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,813
This is Chandler.

125
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,145
You remember Ross?

126
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,481
Oh, hello, Ross.

127
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,722
Mrs. Greene.

128
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,220
What do you think of my
daughter, in the apron...

129
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,590
...with the big job!

130
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,294
Oh, Mom!

131
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:27,366
If you didn't pour the coffee,
no one would have anything to drink.

132
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,308
Believe me, sometimes that happens.

133
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,812
This is just so exciting!
You know, I never worked.

134
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:39,209
I went straight from my father's house
to the sorority house...

135
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:43,148
...to my husband's house.
I am just so proud of you!

136
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:44,855
Really?

137
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:46,949
Let's make a day of it!

138
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:51,860
We will have lunch, we will shopping, we
will get nails done, whatever you want.

139
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,160
Mom, I have to work.

140
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,191
What! No one else can pour coffee?

141
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,637
I know who you remind me of.

142
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,364
Evelyn Durmer.

143
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:06,476
That's before the lousy face-lift.
Now she looks like Soupy Sales.

144
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,516
Pheebs? Who's Evelyn Durmer?

145
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,287
I don't know.
Who's Soupy Sales?

146
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,122
Oh, my God!

147
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,957
There's an unattractive
nude man playing the cello.

148
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,491
Just be glad he's not playing
a smaller instrument.

149
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,831
You have some life here, sweetie!

150
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:38,543
Mom, I realize you and dad were upset
when I didn't marry Barry...

151
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:42,373
...and get the house in the suburbs
with all the security.

152
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,583
This is just
so much better for me.

153
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,752
I do know.
You didn't love Barry, honey.

154
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,546
And I've never seen you this happy.

155
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:55,249
I look at you and I think,
"This is what I want."

156
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,091
For me.

157
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,466
Well, not just for you.

158
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:03,757
What do you mean?

159
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:09,032
I'm considering
leaving your father.

160
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,276
All right, tell me
if this is too cute.

161
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,344
Lesbian wedding...
chicken breasts.

162
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,446
Oh, God.
I think I'm gonna be sick.

163
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:28,193
What? It's not like I'm putting
little nipples on them.

164
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:34,188
Oh! Honey, I'm sorry.
Please don't be mad at me.

165
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:41,433
What can I do? You order me to make
those martial art trick you used to like.

166
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,907
I can call it Carl
Meilong to find out how?

167
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,414
Mom, I just don't understand.
I thought you are happy.

168
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,673
So did I.

169
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:57,190
You know how sometimes you're driving
on the highway, and you get home...

170
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:00,491
...and you can't actually
remember having driven there.

171
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,186
That's kind of my life being like.

172
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,295
Coundn't you listen to the radio more?

173
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:14,438
I wish it is that easy. But then I see you here
and I keep thinking why can't I have this?

174
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:18,409
I want adventures, I want
hang out, I want Chandler.

175
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:25,383
Believe me, Chandler is
no reason to leave daddy!

176
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:32,380
You think it's something having a lot
of fun, but it's really hard, really hard.

177
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:37,395
I got this lausy job, I barely know how to
make it ramdon. Forget about to buying stuff.

178
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:43,926
Honey! You don't understand. I'm be
doing what you are doning, but with money.

179
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,438
It's very different.

180
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,280
- You had no idea what
they getting along? - None.

181
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,014
They didn't fight a lot?

182
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,912
No, they didn't even
talk to each other.

183
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,144
How was I suppose to know
they were having problems?

184
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,254
You know, in my day,
divorce was not an option.

185
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,322
Hey, look who's up!

186
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,826
I just can't believe
this is happening!

187
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,730
When I was little,
everybody's parents got divorced.

188
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:22,064
I figured as an grown up,
I wouldn't have to worry about it.

189
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,208
Can't you look at this
as flattering?

190
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,469
She just wants to be like you.

191
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,807
Well, couldn't she have just
copied my haircut?

192
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,017
When my parents divorced,
they sent me to a shrink...

193
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,280
...and she told me
that kids blame themselves.

194
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,287
But in your case,
it's actually kind of true.

195
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,489
Oh, that's him.

196
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,524
Damn! My mail-order
grandfather hasn't come yet.

197
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,530
- Phoebe?
- Hi, Mr. Adelman.

198
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,703
- Nice to see you.
- Thanks for meeting me.

199
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,499
That's okay. Although you did
cut into my busy day of sitting.

200
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,240
Do you wanna sit?

201
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,379
No, I spent most of my morning
trying to stand up.

202
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,714
What can I do
for you, my dear?

203
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,080
Okay, I don't know how
to say this, but...

204
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,053
I think when your wife's spirit
left her body...

205
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,727
...it kind of stuck around...

206
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:17,893
...in me.

207
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,891
You're saying
my wife is in you?

208
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,227
Yeah. You don't have to
believe me, but...

209
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,735
...can you think of
any unfinished business she had?

210
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,907
Any reason to hang around?

211
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,768
I don't know what to say.

212
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,272
All I can think of is that...

213
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,448
...she used to say that before she
died, she wanted to see everything.

214
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,086
- Everything?
- Everything.

215
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,187
That's a lot of stuff.

216
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:44,547
Oh, wait, I...

217
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,692
I remember she also said she wanted
to sleep with me one last time.

218
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:00,929
I'm sorry.
There's laughing in my head.

219
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:04,908
Worth a shot, huh?

220
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,775
Look at this!

221
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,947
These are all Halloween,
three years ago.

222
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,457
My little martini.
I love your olive head.

223
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,290
Oh, and look, here's Barry.

224
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,563
He came straight
from the office?

225
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,333
Oh, no.
That was his costume.

226
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:34,602
See, he's actually an orthodontist,
but he came as a regular dentist.

227
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,336
He thought that was really funny.

228
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,845
You guys?

229
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,046
Remember when I said
that I don't need your help?

230
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:44,881
Actually, I think you said...

231
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,618
..."Don't touch that
and get out of my kitchen."

232
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,819
Really? Weird.
Anyway...

233
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,492
I planned really well.
I planned and planned.

234
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,628
I just didn't plan
enough time to do it.

235
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,664
- You want some help?
- If you want.

236
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:06,931
What a day!

237
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,833
I took her everywhere.

238
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,846
The Museum of Modern Art,
Rockefeller Center...

239
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,547
...the Statue of Liberty.

240
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:17,976
She's still with you?

241
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:22,014
Yes. I guess she hasn't
seen everything yet.

242
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,023
Be right back. She has to go
to the bathroom again.

243
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,591
Such a pretty face!

244
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,691
Oh, this is so much fun!
Just the girls!

245
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,667
Do you know what we should do?
Does anybody have any marijuana?

246
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:42,803
God!

247
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,674
Did I have to ask do we have pot.

248
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,174
Look, no one's smoking
pot around all this food.

249
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,214
Well, that's fine.

250
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,349
I never did it.
I just thought I might.

251
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,652
What's new in sex?

252
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,359
What's new in sex?

253
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:07,064
The only man I've been with
is your father.

254
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:10,164
I'm dicing. I'm dicing.
I don't hear anything.

255
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,102
This is no offense to your dad,
but I was thinking...

256
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,600
...there might be more.

257
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:19,173
You know what? I cannot
have this conversation with you.

258
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:20,343
All right.

259
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:24,538
You come here and drop this bomb on me
before you even tell Daddy.

260
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,377
Do you want my blessing?
Want me to talk you out of it?

261
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,019
Then what do you want?

262
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,553
I guess I figured
you would understand.

263
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,225
Why on earth
would I understand this?

264
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,153
You didn't marry your Barry, honey.

265
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,298
But I married mine.

266
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,703
We're in trouble. We've only got
12 hours and 36 minutes left.

267
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,604
Move, move, move!

268
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,080
I feel like you should
have German subtitles.

269
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,615
Joey, speed it up!

270
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,753
I'm sorry! It's the pigs! They're
reluctant to get in the blanket!

271
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,356
How did this happen?
I thought you had this planned out.

272
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,691
Do you want me to cry?

273
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,698
Is that what you want?

274
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,798
Do you wanna see me cry?

275
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:18,432
Sir, no, sir!

276
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,174
All right, you!

277
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:27,138
No. Look, I told you, I am
not a part of this thing.

278
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:31,713
Look, Ross. I know you have issues with
Carol and Susan, and I feel for you.

279
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,976
But if you don't help,
I'm gonna take those hot dogs...

280
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:38,121
...and create an appetizer
called "Pigs In Ross."

281
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:40,723
All right, ball a melon!

282
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,053
How come I'm stuck dicing
when he gets to ball a melon?

283
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,129
- How's it going?
- Great! Right on schedule.

284
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,665
Got my little happy helpers.

285
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,842
That's fine. Whatever.

286
00:17:58,977 --> 00:17:59,841
What's wrong?

287
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,042
Nothing.

288
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:06,243
Okay, everything.
I think we're calling off the wedding.

289
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,616
You're still gonna pay me, right?

290
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,117
Or something a little less selfish.

291
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,327
What's the matter?
What happened?

292
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,429
My parents called to say
they weren't coming.

293
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,466
I knew they were
having trouble with this, but...

294
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,569
...they're my parents.
They're supposed to give me away.

295
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,006
Susan and I fought because
I said maybe we should call it off.

296
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,246
She said, "This isn't for them.
It's for us."

297
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,813
And if I couldn't see that,
we should cancel the wedding.

298
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,985
I don't know what to do.

299
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,853
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,
but I think Susan's right.

300
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,691
You do?

301
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:53,720
Do you love her? And don't be
too emphatic about this.

302
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,000
Of course I do.

303
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,826
Well then, that's it.

304
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:03,165
If George and Adelaide can't
accept that, then the hell with them.

305
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,506
If my parents didn't want me
to marry you...

306
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,678
...no way that would've
stopped me.

307
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,883
Look, this is your wedding.

308
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:14,986
Do it.

309
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,250
You're right.
Of course you're right.

310
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:21,886
So we're back on?

311
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:23,654
We're back on.

312
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,762
You heard the woman!
Peel! Chop! Devil!

313
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,198
Can't believe
I lost two minutes!

314
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,538
It just seems so futile.

315
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,410
You know?
All these women, and nothing!

316
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:53,354
I feel like Superman
without my powers, you know?

317
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,854
I have the cape,
and yet I cannot fly.

318
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:03,499
Well, now you understand
how I feel every single day.

319
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,006
The world is my lesbian wedding.

320
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,480
Butterscotch?

321
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,081
No one?

322
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,983
All right,
you'll be sorry later.

323
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,484
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

324
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,195
Ross.

325
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,035
Nothing makes God happier...

326
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:18,037
...than when two people, any two
people, come together in love.

327
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,677
Friends, family,
we're gathered here today...

328
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,438
...to join Carol and Susan
in holy matrimony.

329
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,012
Oh, my God!

330
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,546
Now I've seen everything!

331
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,389
She's gone!

332
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:34,648
She's gone!

333
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:35,790
She's gone.

334
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,621
Go ahead, get married.
Go, go!

335
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:43,401
Strangers in the night

336
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,932
Exchanging glances

337
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:47,831
Wondering in the night

338
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,403
Would you look at them?

339
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,040
Yeah. Can't help but.

340
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,480
How's that pig-in-the-blanket
working out for you?

341
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:03,577
I wrapped those bad boys.

342
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,482
I miss Rose.

343
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:07,555
Oh, yeah?

344
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:12,594
I know it's kind of weird, but
she was a big part of my life...

345
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,559
I don't know, I feel alone.

346
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:20,234
You know, I couldn't help
overhearing what you just said.

347
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:25,542
I think it's time you forget about
Rose, move on with your life.

348
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,436
How about we get you a drink?

349
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,408
Okay. So nice!

350
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:40,456
I shouldn't even bother
coming up with a line, right?

351
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:45,119
Hey, Mom, having fun?

352
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:50,128
Am I! I just danced
with a wonderfully large woman.

353
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,472
And three other girls
made eyes at me over at the buffet.

354
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,241
I'm not saying
it's something I wanna pursue...

355
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,737
...but it's nice to know
I have options.

356
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,710
There's more alcohol, right?

357
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:10,951
How you doing?

358
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,818
You did a good thing today.

359
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,789
You wanna dance?

360
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,165
No, that's fine.

361
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,129
Come on.

362
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,537
I'll let you lead.

363
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,785
Look, penis, schmenis!

364
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,823
Okay? We're all people.

365
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:05,502
Which one of us is gonna be
the first one to get married?

366
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,535
Mon, I was married.

367
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,612
- Yeah, me too, technically.
- I had a wedding.

368
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,249
Just trying to
start a discussion.

369
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:17,981
Which one do you think
will be the last to get married?

370
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,824
Isn't Ben in this?

371
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:24,892
Of course!

372
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:25,960
Absolutely.
