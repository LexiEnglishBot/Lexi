1
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,508
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:13,929
- What are you guys doing up?
- We wanted to finish the crossword before bed.

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,766
Do you know a six-letter
word for "red"?

4
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,102
Dark-red.

5
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:25,774
I think that's wrong, but there's a
connect-the-dots in here for you later.

6
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,111
Hey, how, uh, about maroon?

7
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,865
- Yes! You are so smart!
- Ha-ha-ha.

8
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,408
Aw.

9
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,076
You guys are so cute.

10
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,953
I know.

11
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,205
All right. I'll see you in the morning.

12
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,999
Okay.

13
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,139
You know, I love doing crossword
puzzles with you, honey.

14
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,348
Oh, me too.

15
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,976
- Now, let's finish this and go to bed.
- Okay.

16
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,603
There's only one left.

17
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,273
Three-letter word.
Not dog, but...

18
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,151
Cat.

19
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,737
Yes. Ha.

20
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,031
You are so smart!

21
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,242
I love you.

22
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,911
I love you too.

23
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,143
Uh.

24
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,727
We still need a tip.

25
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,438
All right. Hold on.

26
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,399
I got it.

27
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,693
Nickel.

28
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,445
- How much more do we need?
- Couple of bucks.

29
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,573
Okay, dime.

30
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,034
You guys should probably keep talking.
This could take a while.

31
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,870
Wait, lookit!

32
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,413
Whoa!

33
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,456
Oh, my God. This is a police badge!

34
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,961
Oh, cool. But why would a cop come
in here? They don't serve doughnuts. Ha.

35
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,256
Can you discover the badge again?

36
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,884
I think I can come up with something
better than that.

37
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,345
I bet somebody's
missing that badge.

38
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,640
I should take it back.
Ooh, but while I'm at the police station...

39
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,809
...I could check their
Ten Most Wanted list.

40
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,938
My friend Fritzi's been Number 11 forever.
This could be her year!

41
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,568
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey, Joey.

42
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,070
- Hey.
- Hey.

43
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,656
Is that my sweatshirt?

44
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:23,285
Yes, it is. I'm sorry. I borrowed it.
I was cold. I hope it's okay.

45
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,914
It's just that, uh, if you wear
someone's sweatshirt...

46
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,416
...shouldn't it be your boyfriend's?

47
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,251
And I'm not him.

48
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,046
I'm sorry.
I'll give it back.

49
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,464
No, no. No.

50
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,258
It's going to be all
smelling like Monica.

51
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,302
Are you saying I smell bad?

52
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,511
No.

53
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,931
You smell like a meadow.

54
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,226
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,480
What's with him?

56
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:56,068
The last time Joey went to a meadow,
his mother was shot by a hunter.

57
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,754
I still don't know.

58
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,883
I'm sorry, I just want to make sure
I bought the right couch, one that says:

59
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:24,388
"Kids welcome here,"
but that also says

60
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,890
"Come here to me."

61
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:32,604
What? You say that to kids?

62
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,064
No, no, no.

63
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:38,735
The "Come here to me" is,
you know, for the ladies.

64
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,739
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch,
not a magic couch.

65
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,076
Well, you picked a great couch.

66
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,327
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

67
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,996
- Sign here please.
- Sure.

68
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,456
Oh, what's, heh...?

69
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,084
The delivery charge
is almost as much as the couch!

70
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,212
That's ridiculous.
He lives three blocks away.

71
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,424
You know what? I'll take it myself.
Thank you.

72
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,759
All right, Rach, come on.
Let's go.

73
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,303
Yeah.

74
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,268
Are you kidding?

75
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:16,231
Come on. It's only three blocks.
Uh, it's not very heavy. Try it.

76
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,655
- Oh, I can do it.
- Yeah.

77
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,491
You two will really
enjoy that couch.

78
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,411
We're, uh, not together.

79
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,455
Oh, okay. Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

80
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,415
Something didn't quite add up there.

81
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,213
Ross.

82
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,174
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Ross.

83
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,469
Well, you. Her. Heh.

84
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,471
I mean, she's very...

85
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,930
...you know.

86
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,807
And you're, like...

87
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,809
...you know?

88
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,191
Not that it's any of your business,
but we did go out.

89
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,650
Really? You two?

90
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:01,860
Yeah. Rach?

91
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,572
I don't want to do this now.
I'm carrying a heavy couch.

92
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,075
Then tell him quickly.

93
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,535
Fine. We went out.

94
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,996
Not only did we go out...

95
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,124
...we did it 298 times!

96
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,001
Ross.

97
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,045
Oh, my...

98
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:24,091
Ugh, you kept count?
You are such a loser!

99
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:29,096
A loser you did it with 298 times!

100
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,435
Oh. Oh!

101
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:39,940
Excuse me, ma'am. You can't put
your cigarette out on a tree.

102
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,817
Yeah, I can.
It worked well.

103
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,737
But you shouldn't.
So don't ever do that again.

104
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,865
I won't till I have
my next cigarette.

105
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,325
Hold it!

106
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,494
NYPD. Freeze, punk!

107
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,121
What?

108
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:57,916
That's right. You are so busted.

109
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,334
Book them.

110
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,089
- Who are you talking to?
- Save it, red!

111
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:08,385
Unless you want to spend the night
in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.

112
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,430
I am not going to apologize to a tree.

113
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:15,642
You apologize to the tree right now,
or I am calling for backup.

114
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,312
Backup! Backup!

115
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,189
I'm sorry! Sorry!

116
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,526
Okay, cancel backup!
Cancel backup!

117
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,487
Okay.

118
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,574
Didn't you say there was, um,
an elevator in here?

119
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:34,119
Uh, yes, I did, but there isn't.
Here we go!

120
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,205
Okay, go left.

121
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,541
Left. Left.

122
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,128
Okay, you know what?
There's no more left left.

123
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,047
Lift it straight up over your head.

124
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,592
Straight up over your head. You can do it!

125
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,010
You can do it!

126
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,179
- Okay. You got it?
- Yeah.

127
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,680
- Go, go.
- Good, good.

128
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,016
You got it, right?
You got it, right? You got...

129
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,816
Any chance you think
the couch looks good there?

130
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,611
This guy was all...

131
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,906
And I'm all,
"Buffay! Homicide!"

132
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,409
It was just so cool! Ha-ha-ha.

133
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,870
Phoebe, you were supposed to
take that back.

134
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,414
I know, but I'm having so much fun
doing good deeds.

135
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,543
Okay, but impersonating a police officer
is a serious thing. You can get arrested.

136
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,254
You could get arrested
right now!

137
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,761
All right, yeah, I'd better take it back.
I'm totally drunk with power.

138
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,433
- Hey.
- Hey.

139
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,644
Oh.

140
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,396
Hi, Joe.

141
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,274
Yeah. I didn't know
you guys were gonna be here.

142
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,069
- Do me a favor, sweetie. Taste this.
- What? Why?

143
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,030
- What is going on with you?
- Nothing.

144
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,949
You've been acting strange all day.

145
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,619
All right. There is something. I, uh...

146
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,747
I kind of had a dream.

147
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,875
But I don't want to talk about it.

148
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:07,003
Oh, whoa. What if Martin Luther King
had said that?

149
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,258
I kind of have a dream.

150
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,386
I don't want to talk about it.

151
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,390
Look, it involved Monica.

152
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,434
You had a dream about a girl I'm seeing?
Oh, that is so cool.

153
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,895
I can't tell you how many times
I dreamt about a girl he was seeing.

154
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,732
Anyway, we were talking about your dream.
I love you. Your dream?

155
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,403
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it.
I haven't dreamt about her like that...

156
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,197
...since I found out
about you two-ish.

157
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,453
What was the dream about?

158
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,956
Well, okay.

159
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,043
You were my girlfriend.
We were doing the crossword puzzle.

160
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,087
Like you guys were doing last night.

161
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,465
So that's it. I'm in love
with Monica and I'll be moving out.

162
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:56,428
Joey, come on. That doesn't mean
that you're in love with me.

163
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,138
It doesn't?

164
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,140
It could mean anything.
Like, uh...

165
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,768
...all of a sudden you're jealous
that I've become the apartment stud.

166
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,479
Kind of sounds like your dream, dude.

167
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:13,612
Or it could mean you saw Chandler and me
together, being close and stuff...

168
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,156
...and you just wanna have that
with someone too.

169
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,783
In the dream
I did enjoy the closeness.

170
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,452
Okay, look.

171
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,953
Are you attracted to Monica?

172
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,414
Right here, right now,
are you attracted to her?

173
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,836
- Not really.
- There you have it!

174
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,465
Heh. Well, sure!
I'm just wearing sweats!

175
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,051
But that's good!

176
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,387
You're not in love with me.
You just want a girlfriend.

177
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,098
No, I don't think it's just about
getting a girlfriend.

178
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,725
Yeah, I could get a girlfriend.

179
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:47,062
Yeah, we could sit in the chair
and do crossword puzzles.

180
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:50,106
But are we ever gonna have
the closeness like you guys have?

181
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:54,611
Monica and I were friends before
we started dating. Maybe that's it.

182
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,696
Friends first?

183
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,573
That's interesting.

184
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:03,370
- You become friends after?
- No, never done that either.

185
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,915
Um, do you guys have
a tape measure?

186
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,833
Oh, yeah. It's actually in my bedroom.

187
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,253
That's right.

188
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,893
What's up, Joey?

189
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,231
How you doing?

190
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,368
- Excuse me. Is this your car?
- Yeah.

191
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,746
Well, I don't think it's nice of you to park here.
You're blocking the entrance.

192
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,915
Don't worry about it.
It's not a problem.

193
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:54,045
It's a problem for me, which means
it's a problem for you because I'm a cop.

194
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,757
So am I.

195
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,761
Oh, no.

196
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,058
Oh, okay. So you're a cop.
You can park anywhere.

197
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,269
I know that because I'm a cop too.

198
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,021
All right. Keep up the good work.
Ten-four.

199
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,899
Wait a second.
So, what precinct are you with?

200
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,694
I'm with the, um, the 57th.

201
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,197
- I know a guy in Homicide up there.
- I'm in Vice.

202
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,909
In fact, I'm undercover
right now. I'm a whore.

203
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,038
Who else is in Vice up there?

204
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,999
Um, do you know, um...

205
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,500
...Sipowitz?

206
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,336
Sipowitz? No, I don't think so.

207
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,757
Yeah. Sipowitz. Yeah.
Big guy, kind of bald.

208
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,967
I don't know him.

209
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,472
Don't try to call him or anything.
Because he's not there. He's out.

210
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,266
His, um, partner just died.

211
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,312
Tell Sipowitz I'm real sorry for his loss.

212
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,939
I sure will. Take care.

213
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,776
Hey, by the way, I'm sure Sipowitz
is gonna be all right.

214
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,987
I heard that kid from Silver Spoons
is really good.

215
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,742
Where'd you find my badge?

216
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,494
Oh!

217
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:20,340
Hey, Joey, would you mind giving me
and Ross a hand moving his couch?

218
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,468
Aw, I'd love to but I got acting class.
But you know what?

219
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,179
I guess I could blow that off for you.

220
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,352
Thanks.

221
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,648
Uh, let me ask you something.
I was talking with Monica and Chandler.

222
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,691
Boy, they are really tight.

223
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,901
I know.

224
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,195
That's not a bad situation
they got over there.

225
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,905
Mm-mm.

226
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,449
Thinking of getting me one of those.

227
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,371
What's up, Joe?

228
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,916
The reason I think Monica
and Chandler are so great...

229
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,752
...is because they were friends first,
you know?

230
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:02,298
So I asked myself, who are my friends?
You and Phoebe.

231
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,884
I saw you first, so...

232
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,804
- Heh.
- Mm-hm.

233
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:12,517
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.

234
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,939
You know, honey, um...

235
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,483
...as, uh, flattered as I am...

236
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,361
...that you saw me first...

237
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:28,032
...uh, I just don't think we should be
cranking anything up.

238
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,702
I'll treat you real nice.

239
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,876
Oh!

240
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,628
Yeah. Well, you know, um...

241
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:46,718
Listen, I think it's a great idea to become
friends with someone before you date.

242
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:51,097
But I think the way you do it is you
meet someone, become their friend...

243
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,767
...build a foundation,
then ask them out on a date.

244
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,520
Don't hit on your existing friends.

245
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,941
Won't that take longer?

246
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,235
Yeah. Yeah.

247
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,321
Oh, but once you find it...

248
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,740
...it's so worth the wait.

249
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,909
Yeah.

250
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,160
I understand.

251
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,162
Good.

252
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,873
Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first.

253
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,711
Come here to me.

254
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,924
No, no. You come here to me.

255
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,302
Hey, Ross.

256
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,513
- Ahem, I brought reinforcements.
- Oh, great! You brought Joey?

257
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,223
I brought the next best thing. Heh.

258
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,975
Hey.

259
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,521
You brought Chandler?
The next best thing would be Monica!

260
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:45,526
I would be offended, but Monica
is freakishly strong, so...

261
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,613
Look, I drew a sketch of how we'll do it.

262
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,740
Rach, that's you.

263
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,951
That's the couch.

264
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,244
Oh, what's that?

265
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,955
Oh, that's me.

266
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,916
Wow.

267
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,670
Certainly think a lot of yourself.

268
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,298
No. That's my arm.

269
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:15,765
Oh, I see. I thought you just really,
really liked your new couch.

270
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,645
Just follow my lead.

271
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,480
Okay.

272
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,941
Come on, Chandler.

273
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,275
Ah.

274
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,777
- All right.
- Okay.

275
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,238
Here we go.

276
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,864
All right. Ready?

277
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,199
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

278
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,450
- Turn!
- Okay.

279
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,660
Turn!

280
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,245
Turn!

281
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:42,208
- I don't think we can turn anymore!
- I don't think it'll fit!

282
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,378
Yeah, it will.
Come on! Up, up, up!

283
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,463
Up! Yes!

284
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,966
Here we go! Pivot!

285
00:16:50,676 --> 00:17:01,894
Pivot!

286
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:05,189
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

287
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,612
I don't think it's gonna pivot anymore.

288
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,156
You think?

289
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:19,245
All right, let's, uh, bring it
back down and try again.

290
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,622
Oh.

291
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,833
Whoa.

292
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,881
I think it's really stuck now.

293
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:35,011
- I can't believe that didn't work.
- I know. Me neither.

294
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,971
I mean, you had a sketch.

295
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,476
What did you mean when
you said "pivot"?

296
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,398
- Hey.
- Hey.

297
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,193
How's it going?
Did you make any new friends?

298
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,945
Yeah. I met this woman.

299
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,906
Hey. Whoa, whoa.

300
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,657
What's she like?

301
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,534
Uh, well, she's...

302
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,036
...really good in bed.

303
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,790
I thought you were going to
try to be friends first.

304
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:07,126
- Hey, it's all your fault.
- What? Why?

305
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,463
You didn't give me advice.
You gave me a pickup line.

306
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:14,467
I told her I wanted to
"build a foundation and be friends."

307
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:19,430
Suddenly, through no fault of my own,
I became irresistible to her!

308
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,808
And her roommate!

309
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,728
What about the "closeness"?

310
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:30,441
Closeness, schmosness! There was
three of us, for crying out loud!

311
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,781
Who wants pizza?

312
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,366
I do! I do! I do!

313
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,954
This is great! Can you believe
I found this on the second floor?

314
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,917
- Who is it?
- NYPD.

315
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,169
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

316
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,964
Uh, just a minute, officer!

317
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:06,310
- I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay.
- My God, it's him! It's that cop!

318
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,523
- I can't believe he found me!
- Are you going to go to jail?

319
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,901
If I'm going down,
you guys are going down with me.

320
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,448
Harboring a fugitive?
That's one-to-three years minimum.

321
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,742
Good luck, Chandler.

322
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,208
You can arrest me, but you'll never
make it stick and you know it.

323
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,753
I kind of don't have a choice, it's my job.
You understand, right?

324
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,715
Yeah, as long as you understand
that I'm gonna call my lawyer.

325
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:39,802
And once he puts you on the stand, he's
gonna make you look like a fool! Like a fool!

326
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,598
I don't like looking foolish.

327
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:48,227
Maybe, uh, I don't arrest you today.
Maybe I came by and you weren't here.

328
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,605
I would love it if I weren't here!

329
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:55,359
Since, um, you're not going to jail
tonight, I was wondering if you'd, um...

330
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,820
...like to go to dinner with me?

331
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,780
- Me?
- Yeah.

332
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:03,784
Ever since you flashed my badge at me,
I kind of can't stop thinking about you.

333
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,830
You're the prettiest fake
undercover whore I've ever seen.

334
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,417
Nice.

335
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,923
Wow, I didn't see that coming.
You're asking me out.

336
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,551
Yeah, I could've done it better,
but these people keep staring at me.

337
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,972
Um, yeah, I'd like to go out
with you, officer.

338
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,600
- Gary.
- Gary.

339
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,769
- Okay, so it's a date.
- Yeah.

340
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,563
I gotta ask you, though.
How did you know where to find me?

341
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,900
Your fingerprints were all over my badge
so I ran them through the computer.

342
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,778
This was listed as your last known address
so I checked it out.

343
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,987
Oh, impressive.

344
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:44,533
Not as impressive as you. I looked at your
record and you've done some weird stuff.

345
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,410
We'll talk at dinner.

346
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,828
Okay.

347
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,039
So I'll come by in a couple hours
and pick you up?

348
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,707
- All right, I can't wait.
- Okay.

349
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,710
Don't worry, I won't just
take you out for doughnuts.

350
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,507
He has a gun!

351
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:09,642
I'd like to return this couch.
I'm not satisfied with it.

352
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,066
You want to return this couch?

353
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,195
It's cut in half.

354
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:26,325
- That's what I'm telling you.
- Did you cut this couch in half?

355
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,788
This couch is cut in half!

356
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:37,295
I would like to exchange it for one
that is not cut in half.

357
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:41,048
You're telling me this couch
was delivered to you like this?

358
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,426
Look, I'm a reasonable man.

359
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,679
I will accept store credit.

360
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:51,392
I'll give you store credit
in the amount of $4.

361
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,522
I will take it.
