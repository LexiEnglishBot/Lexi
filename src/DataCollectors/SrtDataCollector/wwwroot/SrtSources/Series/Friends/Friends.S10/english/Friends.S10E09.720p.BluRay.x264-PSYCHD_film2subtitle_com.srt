1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,211
Hey.

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,504
- Hey.
- Hey.

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,965
We're here to say goodbye.
We're off to Ohio.

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,384
Oh, right, your adoption interview.

5
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:13,387
Yep. We'll meet the lady
who could be carrying our baby.

6
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:17,725
I can't believe it. When you come back,
you'll have a baby. That is so weird.

7
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,810
And so incorrect.

8
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,312
She's only a couple months pregnant.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,898
She liked our application,
who knows if she'll like us.

10
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,109
Oh, come on, she's gonna
love you guys.

11
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,029
Oh, thank you. But we're trying
not to get our hopes up.

12
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,822
A lot could still get in our way.

13
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,992
She could decide against adoption,
like another couple better.

14
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,618
What are you gonna name it?

15
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,914
I could develop a condition in which
I talk and talk, and no one hears a word.

16
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,210
But just think, okay?
What if everything goes right?

17
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,588
What if this woman does pick you guys?

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,967
Oh, my God. She's gonna pick us!

19
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,762
So we're standing firm on
"not getting our hopes up"?

20
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,432
No. I know things could still
go wrong, but if they don't...

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,477
...if this works out,
we're gonna have a baby. A baby!

22
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,645
- Yes. But...
- Oh, my God. It's gonna work!

23
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,314
We're gonna make it work!

24
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,858
I'm gonna be a mommy
and you're gonna be a daddy!

25
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,903
All right, I'll see you suckers.
I'm gonna go get me a baby!

26
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,701
Oh, screw it. I'm gonna be a daddy!

27
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,789
Hey, who's Phoebe with?

28
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,460
I wanna say, "Someone
I'm gonna have sex with."

29
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,298
- Hey.
- Hey.

30
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,635
- So, uh, who's your friend?
- Oh, that's Sarah.

31
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,929
No. Don't you get any ideas.

32
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,557
I'm not setting you up
with any more of my friends.

33
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,101
- Why? Why?
- Because you'll date her once...

34
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,478
...sleep with her, then forget she exists.

35
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,814
Oh! Name one friend of yours
I did that with.

36
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,358
- Mandy.
- Mandy, huh? Uh...

37
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,111
Really hot blond, big boobs?

38
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:39,158
- No.
- Might be why I don't remember her, huh?

39
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,578
Do you think I'm someone else?

40
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,294
Okay, look, I may not have treated
your friends well in the past.

41
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,422
But I have grown up a lot.
Really. Honest. Rach?

42
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,549
Yeah, believe it or not, it's true.

43
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,634
I mean, when Joey and I were together...

44
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:02,014
...he was wonderful.
He was thoughtful and mature.

45
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,184
And for the one week
that we went out...

46
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,769
...he didn't sleep with anybody else.

47
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,022
Growth.

48
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,152
- Fine, I'll give you her number.
- Okay. Thank you.

49
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,487
And I promise you
I will not forget this one.

50
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,947
- Mandy.
- Sarah!

51
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,949
Sarah.

52
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,703
- Hey.
- Hi.

53
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,122
- Hey.
- Hey, guys, I need some fashion advice.

54
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,790
Oh. Huh.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,834
How does this look?

56
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,884
Well, it's... It's a little low.
Pick it up a little.

57
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,680
A little bit more.

58
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,265
There you go.

59
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,852
Now throw it away.

60
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,730
Come on! This looks good.

61
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,359
Ross, please trust me.
I buy 30 fashion magazines a month.

62
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:59,029
Now, I don't know who's running
for president or who that NATO guy is...

63
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,199
...but I do know that you
have to get far away from that hat.

64
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,992
Damn it. God...

65
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,537
I have this date tomorrow night,
and I have to look cool.

66
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,832
If you want fashion help, Rachel and I
are going shopping tomorrow.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,086
- You're welcome to come with us.
- Really? That would be great.

68
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,754
Uh, I mean, I have to do something.

69
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,798
She kind of teased me
about how I dress.

70
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,592
I can see why. Nice shirt. Ha, ha.

71
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,886
You're wearing the same shirt.

72
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,849
Stupid Gap on every corner!

73
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,944
Make yourselves comfortable,
and I'll be back with Erica.

74
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,612
Okay, thank you.

75
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,783
Well, this is it.

76
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,244
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's just weird, you know?

77
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:52,124
It's like, uh, "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I
have the human growing inside you?"

78
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,917
Ooh!

79
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,462
You're gonna be great.

80
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,048
Well, obviously.

81
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,885
Monica? Chandler?
I'd like you to meet Erica.

82
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,763
- Hi.
- Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.

83
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,974
- Hi.
- Thank you for agreeing to see us.

84
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,851
- Hi.
- I'll let you get acquainted.

85
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,062
- Okay.
- So it's Monica and Chandler?

86
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:18,525
I only know you as
"File CRW33815-D."

87
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,653
That's what our friends call us.

88
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:26,533
Gosh, you know, you're just
such an amazing couple. It's...

89
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,035
...kind of intimidating.

90
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,120
Oh, ha, ha. I don't know about that.

91
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,248
Are you kidding me?
I mean, it's enough that you're a doctor.

92
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,753
But on top of it,
you're married to a reverend?

93
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,427
- I don't think that's exactly...
- Let her finish, doctor.

94
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,558
- Hey.
- Hey.

95
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,394
Oh, my friend Sarah
had a great time last night.

96
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,105
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so you gonna call this one back?

97
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,107
Ha, ha. No.

98
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,027
What are you talking about?
Sarah's great.

99
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,906
Oh, really? You wanna know
what your "great" friend did?

100
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,783
We were out to dinner, okay?

101
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,410
We were getting along,
having a really nice time.

102
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,537
I was thinking she was really cool.

103
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,207
And then, out of nowhere...

104
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,564
That's it?

105
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,109
That's why you won't
go out with her again?

106
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,944
So she took some fries. Big deal.

107
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,446
Hey, look, it's not about a few fries.

108
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,490
It's about what the fries represent.

109
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,076
- What?
- All food!

110
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,453
Well, I'm sorry.

111
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,832
I can't believe I set you up
with such a monster!

112
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,167
Hey, hey, hey, look, I take a girl out...

113
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,629
...she can order whatever she wants.
The more the better, all right?

114
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,800
Just don't order a garden salad
and then eat my food!

115
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,511
That's a good way to lose some fingers.

116
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,014
Oh, thank God you're here.

117
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,266
- Listen to this.
- What?

118
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:18,186
Joey and my friend are out last night,
having dinner, and she reaches over...

119
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,189
...and takes a few of his fries...
- Oh, no!

120
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,483
Mm-hm.
- What?

121
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,862
You know about the plate thing?

122
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,573
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, Joey doesn't share food.

123
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,451
I mean, just last week
we were having breakfast...

124
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,661
...and he had a couple grapes
on his plate.

125
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,372
- You wouldn't let her have a grape?
- Oh, no, not me.

126
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,665
Emma.

127
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,212
Joey doesn't share food!

128
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,012
Well, I still think that is a stupid reason
not to call someone again.

129
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,473
You are calling her, okay?

130
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:58,226
And if you need to, then just
get an extra plate of fries for the table.

131
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,649
I like that.

132
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,194
A sharing buffer. Yeah.

133
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,822
Yeah, I'll order some extra fries.
Maybe a plate of onion rings.

134
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,699
Yeah. Yeah.

135
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,243
And a shrimp cocktail.

136
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,662
Uh-huh. And some Buffalo wings.

137
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,874
Maybe...
Maybe an individual pizza, huh?

138
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,543
And some mozzarella sticks.

139
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,546
What were we talking about?

140
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,428
Wow, this place is awesome.

141
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,181
We should just go.
I'm not gonna find anything here.

142
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,807
This stuff is ridiculous.

143
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,560
Oh, this place is great!

144
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,270
Wow.

145
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,732
Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear
any of this. Nothing silver.

146
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,985
- Wha...?
- Okay, nothing with hair.

147
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,863
- And nothing with padlocks on it!
- Aw.

148
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,033
Ross, look. Look, I know that
some of this stuff is out there.

149
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,119
But, I mean, come on, look at this.
Look at this sweater.

150
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,788
I mean, this is just beautiful.

151
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,165
Wow, this is really soft.

152
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,876
Three hundred and fifty dollars?

153
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:09,381
Down from 700.
You're saving like 200 bucks.

154
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:15,345
Both logic and math are taking
a serious hit today.

155
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,266
Hey, check this out. It's totally you.

156
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,559
- Wow.
- Yeah.

157
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,227
Huh.

158
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,148
Wow. Actually, this looks pretty good.

159
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,692
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

160
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,989
"Boys will be boys"?

161
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,325
- What? They will be!
- All right.

162
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,662
- That's it, I'm getting out of here.
- No, Ross, wait, come on.

163
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:44,332
There's other stuff here. There's some
nice shirts, these nice pants.

164
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,252
Huh. Actually, these might look
pretty good on me.

165
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,297
Yes, they will. You know what you
should do? Go take a walk.

166
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:54,134
I know your size, and I'm gonna pick out
some really good stuff for you.

167
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,719
- Really?
- Yes.

168
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,387
I know what looks sexy on guys.

169
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,682
Just wear what I suggest,
and she is gonna go nuts for you.

170
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,267
So you're saying, uh...

171
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,605
...if I wear these pants,
I might be getting into hers?

172
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,983
Why do men keep talking to me like this?

173
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:16,239
So the fact that I'm a doctor
and my wife's a reverend...

174
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,866
...that's important to you?

175
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,951
Yeah. I read some great applications...

176
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,204
...but I thought, "Who better
than a minister to raise a child?"

177
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,956
Amen.

178
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,794
Plus, I thought the baby would be
in good hands with a doctor.

179
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,047
Oh, good hands.

180
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,299
Healing hands.

181
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,803
Reverend, can I ask? Does the Bible
say anything about adoption?

182
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,972
It says, "Do it."

183
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:48,438
"And behold, she did adopt
unto them a baby.

184
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,941
And it was good."

185
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,571
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

186
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,574
I was wondering...
You both have such serious jobs.

187
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,869
Would you have time to take care
of a baby and your flock?

188
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,246
Oh, no, my flock? My flock is good.

189
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,708
Yeah. My flock pretty much
takes care of themselves by this point.

190
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,877
It's a good flock. Flock, flock, flock.

191
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,924
But being a doctor,
that must take up a lot of time.

192
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,885
Not for me it doesn't.

193
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,137
So how's everything going in here?

194
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,932
We're great. I think
I may have asked all my questions.

195
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,975
Good. Do you have questions for Erica?

196
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:29,896
Yeah, actually.
So you read a file that you liked...

197
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,650
...and then you gave the agency
the serial number and they contacted us?

198
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,152
Oh, yes. Our system ensures
total anonymity.

199
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,364
- We're very proud of it.
- You should be.

200
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,909
You're really on top of stuff.

201
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,746
Well, then if there's nothing else,
then the two of us should talk.

202
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,456
I actually...

203
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,917
- I don't think we have to.
- We don't?

204
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:54,337
Yeah, when I read about you two,
I was pretty sure I wanted you...

205
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,132
...but I just thought we should meet
face to face.

206
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,509
I've made my decision.

207
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,553
I choose them. Heh.

208
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,347
Oh, my God, this is great.

209
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,391
This is so great. Did you hear that?

210
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,851
Yeah, I did.

211
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,561
Okay.

212
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,273
- Thank you. Thank you so much. Oh.
- Ha, ha.

213
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,776
Oh. You are so going to heaven!

214
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:26,619
- Oh, we got some really great stuff.
- Yeah.

215
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,289
Yeah, but I'm not sure about some
of the bras I got.

216
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,083
Oh, really? Do you wanna try
some of them on for me?

217
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,585
Oh, okay.

218
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,463
Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?

219
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:42,051
Oh, no. I took one of Ross' bags
by mistake.

220
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,137
And one of mine is missing.

221
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,681
Ross probably has it.
You'll get it from him later.

222
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,732
So, what do you think?

223
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:01,196
I think we're not wearing
the same shirt anymore.

224
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,407
Yeah. Yeah, Rachel picked it out for me.

225
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,452
She told me to trust her,
and you know what? I'm glad I did.

226
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,246
I turned quite a few heads
on my way over here.

227
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,418
Dude, I really don't think
you should be wearing that.

228
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,504
Oh, I see.

229
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:21,925
Somebody's afraid of a little competition
with the ladies?

230
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,512
Looks like someone is the ladies!

231
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,098
You're just jealous
because you couldn't pull this off.

232
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:33,102
Yeah. Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a date.

233
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:39,484
See? All eyes on me!

234
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,242
- We are not signing those papers.
- Why not?

235
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:51,079
It's wrong. They made a mistake.
They think we're somebody else.

236
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,790
God works in mysterious ways.

237
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,709
You have gotta stop.

238
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,795
But she liked us.

239
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,798
She likes Doctor Chandler
and Reverend Monica.

240
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:06,052
If you think about it,
I'm kind of like a reverend.

241
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:12,600
I mean, as a chef, I serve God
by feeding the hungry and poor.

242
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,271
Your veal chop is 34.95.

243
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,316
Come on, I just...
I think we've been given an opportunity.

244
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,486
The mistake's already made.
They're writing up the papers now.

245
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,572
But we're not the ones she chose.

246
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,824
How can you feel okay about this?

247
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,327
Because.

248
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,789
We may not be who she thinks we are...

249
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,709
...but no one will ever
love that baby more than us.

250
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,377
- I know.
- I mean, who knows...

251
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,630
...how long it's gonna take
for someone else to give us a baby?

252
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,633
What if no one ever picks us?

253
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,218
Oh, honey...

254
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,970
Please?

255
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,639
Please. We are so close.

256
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,894
Monica, I want a baby too.

257
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,354
But this woman is giving away her child.

258
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,399
She deserves to know who it's going to.

259
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,783
Okay. You're right.

260
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,121
So we'll tell the truth.

261
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,791
And who knows, you know?
Maybe she'll like us for us.

262
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,296
Maybe she will.

263
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,049
Oh, why couldn't I
have been a reverend?

264
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,468
You're Jewish.

265
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,096
Technicality!

266
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,145
Garden salad for the lady.

267
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,607
- Oh, that looks great. Good ordering.
Ha-ha-ha.

268
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,653
Seafood platter for the gentleman,
and extra fries.

269
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,529
- Enjoy.
- Ha, ha.

270
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,492
Mm. Those fries look delicious.

271
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,161
- Oh, I didn't know you liked french fries.
- Ha, ha.

272
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,205
Help yourself. What's mine is yours.

273
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,379
Oh. Wow, are those stuffed clams?

274
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:08,967
Uh...

275
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,469
Yes, they are my stuffed clams.

276
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,598
How about those fries, though, huh?

277
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,687
- They are delicious. Ha-ha-ha.
- Yeah.

278
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:27,026
You are beautiful, you know that?

279
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,113
That is so sweet.

280
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,117
Okay, then.

281
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,703
Mm.

282
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,791
Mm-hm.

283
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,213
Now look what you did!

284
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,049
What? What is the matter with you?

285
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,594
I don't like it when people
take food off of my plate, okay?

286
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,763
But you said, "What's mine is yours."

287
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,640
Well, I didn't mean it!

288
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:03,354
Fine. Sorry, I didn't think
it was that big a deal.

289
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,899
No, I'm sorry. I...

290
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:11,529
I'm overreacting, okay?
It's just, when it comes to food, I...

291
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,239
...have certain rules...

292
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,199
...okay? I mean...

293
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:20,371
...there are things you do, and,
you know, things that you don't do.

294
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,796
Wow, this place looks great.

295
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:33,634
Oh, you are gonna love it.
And I'm so glad we're finally doing this.

296
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,846
- Me too.
- Here.

297
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,690
So this was fun.

298
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,701
I really am sorry about,
you know, before.

299
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,496
And I wanna make sure you know
I really do like you.

300
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,457
Sure, just not as much as clams.

301
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,417
Well, stuffed clams, ha, ha...

302
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,338
- Chocolate torte for the lady.
- Mm.

303
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,632
Cheesecake for the gentleman.

304
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:17,595
Uh, excuse me, sir. There seems to be
some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.

305
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,140
Oh. Yes, that's a raspberry coulis.

306
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,852
I'm so stupid ordering cheesecake,
trying to be healthy.

307
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,564
Oh, my God. Mm.

308
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,275
- I'll just have what she's having.
- I'm sorry, sir.

309
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,319
- That was our last piece.
- Mm.

310
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,239
Mm. Mm.

311
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,784
Oh, no.

312
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,745
This is work. I should call in.
Can you excuse me?

313
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,123
Oh, yeah, sure. No problem.

314
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,628
What are you doing?
I thought you don't share food?

315
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,255
Sure I do.

316
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,132
- Coulis?
- Ha, ha.

317
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,636
No. If I can't have your clams,
you can't have my dessert.

318
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,263
This is a two-way street.

319
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,684
Really?

320
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,519
Really.

321
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,730
Now this all better be here
when I come back.

322
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:14,944
Yeah, of course. I can control myself.
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah.

323
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,332
Stop staring at me!

324
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:42,138
Just a tiny little... Ha, ha.

325
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,642
Uh-oh.

326
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,654
I'm not even sorry.

327
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,744
- Hi.
- Hey.

328
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,831
So these are the preliminary forms
for an open adoption. Uh...

329
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,918
There's a lot to go over,
but I'll explain as we go through.

330
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:16,172
- Is that a picture?
- Yeah.

331
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,841
It's a sonogram they took
of the baby last week.

332
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,676
I thought you might wanna see it.

333
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,228
Look, doctor.

334
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:37,526
Look, before we sign anything,
we really have to talk.

335
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,907
We're not who you think we are.

336
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,202
- I don't understand.
- The agency must have made a mistake.

337
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,288
My wife is not a reverend,
and I'm not a doctor.

338
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,374
- What?
- That's impossible.

339
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,919
I could perform an operation on you
and prove it if you'd like.

340
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,840
Um, I have to check your file. Excuse me.

341
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,300
So who are you?

342
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,595
Our names really are Monica and
Chandler. We're from New York.

343
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,181
Yeah, but the important thing
to know about us...

344
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,518
...is how much we would care
for this little baby.

345
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,728
So you lied to me before?

346
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:16,482
Well, we "bore false witness."

347
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,403
See? I could be a reverend.

348
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,989
I can't believe this.

349
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,741
But we were hoping that
since we told you the truth...

350
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,953
...that you still might consider...
- Giving you my baby?

351
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,247
You think I'd give you my child
after this?

352
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,083
You don't have to decide now.
If you look at our file...

353
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,336
I don't wanna look at your file.
This is over.

354
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,509
Erica, wait.

355
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,636
I have nothing to say to you.

356
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,557
Look, you have every reason to be upset.
We did lie.

357
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:53,811
But only because we've been waiting
and trying to have a baby for so long.

358
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:57,440
And we don't know how long it's gonna be
before we get another chance.

359
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,817
Why don't you ask the reverend
to pray on it?

360
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,486
Erica, please.

361
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:07,199
Just consider us.
Ask them to see our file.

362
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,327
Our last name's Bing.

363
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,079
My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.

364
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,999
Oh, yeah.

365
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,710
I actually liked you guys.

366
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,464
But it doesn't matter.
What you did was wrong.

367
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,258
But you did like us.

368
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,260
And you should.

369
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,013
My wife's an incredible woman.

370
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:33,225
She is loving, and devoted and caring.

371
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:37,563
And don't tell her I said this,
but the woman's always right.

372
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:44,779
I love my wife more than anything
in this world.

373
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,656
And it...

374
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:52,244
It kills me that I can't give her a baby.

375
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,002
I really want a kid.

376
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,799
And when that day finally comes,
I'll learn how to be a good dad.

377
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,301
But my wife...

378
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,762
...she's already there.

379
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,098
She's a mother...

380
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,226
...without a baby.

381
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,193
Please?

382
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,165
You still want that baby?

383
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,016
God bless you, Chandler Bing!

384
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,533
Turns out this sweater
is made for a woman.

385
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,912
So why are you still wearing it?

386
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,664
Because it's soft.

387
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,251
- Hey, so how was your date?
- Ugh.

388
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,253
Not so good.

389
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:30,593
Well, looks like it's just
the two of us tonight, huh, buddy?

390
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,804
Yeah. And you know what?
We could do a lot worse.

391
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,891
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

392
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,187
Joey doesn't share food!
