1
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:05,234
Man, this is weird.

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:08,099
Ever realize Cap'n Crunch's
eyebrows are on his hat?

3
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:09,430
That's what's weird?

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:12,609
The man's been captain
of a cereal for 40 years.

5
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:17,881
What?

6
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,745
The spoon!
You licked and you put.

7
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,189
You licked and you put.

8
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,421
Yeah, so?

9
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:31,388
Don't you see how gross that is?
It's like you using my toothbrush!

10
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:33,629
You used my toothbrush?

11
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:39,134
Only because I used the red one
to unclog the drain.

12
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,468
Mine is the red one!

13
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:47,469
Oh, God!
Can open. Worms everywhere!

14
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,780
Why can't we use the same toothbrush...

15
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,949
...but we can use the same soap?

16
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:56,984
Because soap is soap.
It's self-cleaning.

17
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,618
The next time you shower...

18
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:03,761
...think about the last thing I wash
and the first thing you wash.

19
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:10,868
The One Where Joey Moves Out

20
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,543
Look at you fancy lads!

21
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:59,173
What's the occasion?

22
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,080
You know that guy on my show
that's in a coma?

23
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,051
He's having a brunch.

24
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,725
Ready when you are.

25
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,530
I can't believe you're
actually getting tattoos.

26
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,823
You guys are getting tattoos?

27
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:17,400
But you cannot tell Ross
because I wanna surprise him.

28
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,468
Wow, this is wild!
What are you gonna get?

29
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,968
I'm getting a lily.

30
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,537
For my mom, because her name's Lily.

31
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:30,910
That's lucky. What if
her name was Big Ugly Splotch?

32
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,749
- Where you getting it?
- On my shoulder.

33
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,784
What?

34
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,186
What's on your shoulder?

35
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:39,623
A chip.

36
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,027
I've got a big attitude problem.

37
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,999
- A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo.
- A tattoo?

38
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,532
Why? Why would you wanna do that?

39
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,264
You don't think
they're kind of cool?

40
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,440
No. Sorry, I don't.

41
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,942
Why would anyone pay someone
to scar their body for life?

42
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,206
What if it doesn't come out right?

43
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,475
It's like having
a bad haircut all the time.

44
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,449
Why is everyone staring at me?

45
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,425
Sign this card for Dad.
Richard will be here soon.

46
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,491
Richard's going to the party too?

47
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,026
He's my parents' best friend.
He has to go.

48
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,630
So is today the day
you'll tell them about you two?

49
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,895
Yeah, for my dad's birthday,
I decided to give him a stroke.

50
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,068
No, I think you should tell them.

51
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,708
I don't know how serious he is.
Until I do, I won't say anything.

52
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:35,310
I don't think
Mom and Dad would mind.

53
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,483
Remember when you were 9
and Richard was 30, Dad said...

54
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,515
..."God, I hope they get together."

55
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:26,829
Shall we?

56
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,624
Okay, wait.

57
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,533
You know what?

58
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,838
Ross, let's switch places.
You get in the middle.

59
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,539
This looks like we're trying
to cover something up.

60
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:41,406
You could come in straddling him,
they still wouldn't believe it.

61
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,042
We're here!

62
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:48,009
- Hi, kids!
- The children!

63
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:51,114
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Thank you.

64
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:52,588
Happy birthday!

65
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,326
So you kids thanked
Dr. Burke for the ride?

66
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:59,497
Actually, Mom, I think Monica
thanked him for the both of us.

67
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,235
So you kids take the train in?

68
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,937
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.

69
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,466
Speaking of whom...

70
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:11,642
...I hear he's got some
20-year-old twinkie in the city.

71
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,472
Finger cramp! Oh, God!

72
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,014
Sorry. Here, let me get that, Mom.

73
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:25,183
So Richard's shopping
in the junior section?

74
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,458
Are we still on that?

75
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,161
You just know she's got
the IQ of a napkin.

76
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,263
She's probably not even pretty.

77
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:37,263
Just young enough so that
everything is still pointing up.

78
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:46,634
Can you believe this place?

79
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,810
I know. This is a great apartment.

80
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,879
In the bathroom there's mirrors
on both sides of you.

81
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,450
When you're in there, it's like
peeing with the Rockettes.

82
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,320
Well, there's my fantasy come true.

83
00:05:59,125 --> 00:05:59,921
Seriously.

84
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,296
We were just saying, great apartment!

85
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,495
Thanks. You want it?

86
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,266
I'm moving to a bigger place.

87
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,195
You should take this one.

88
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,632
Can you see me in a place like this?

89
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:16,265
Why not? You hate park views
and high ceilings?

90
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,510
Come on, I'll show you the kitchen.

91
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,780
That's all right,
I saw a kitchen this morning.

92
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:23,947
On TV.

93
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,649
Stop talking. Okay!

94
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,378
- Come on, tell us!
- Is she really 20?

95
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,487
I am not telling you guys anything.

96
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,522
Come on, it's my birthday.
Let me live vicariously!

97
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,388
Dad, you really don't want to do that.

98
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,292
What's a little midlife crisis
between friends?

99
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,034
Would you let it go?

100
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,703
I know what you're going through.
When I turned 50, I got the Porsche.

101
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,203
You got your own little speedster.

102
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,875
- Seriously, it's not like that.
- Tell you what.

103
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:57,047
Maybe one of these weekends
you can borrow the car and I could

104
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,681
Dad, I beg you not
to finish that sentence!

105
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,713
What? I'm kidding!

106
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,852
You know I'd never let him
touch the Porsche.

107
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:13,795
Okay, Rach.

108
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,201
Which lily?
This lily or that lily?

109
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,100
- Well, I
- I like this lily.

110
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,772
It's more open
and that's like my mom.

111
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,509
She had a more open, giving spirit.

112
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,979
Foghorn Leghorn!

113
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,909
Blonde girl?
You're in room two.

114
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,619
Not-so-blonde girl, you're with me.

115
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,577
Here we go!

116
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,122
You're not going.

117
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,561
Is this because of what Ross said?

118
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,966
- Well, yeah, maybe.
- I don't believe this.

119
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:52,101
Is this how this relationship works?
Ross equals boss?

120
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,467
Come on, what is this, 1922?

121
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,439
What's 1922?

122
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,211
Just, you know, a long time ago.

123
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:05,208
When men used to tell women
what to do a lot.

124
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:09,043
Then there was suffrage, which was
a good thing. But it sounds horrible.

125
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:13,923
Do you want this tattoo?

126
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,127
Yes, I do.
It's just that Ross

127
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,161
Is your boyfriend the boss of you?

128
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,992
Who is the boss of you?

129
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:26,663
You?

130
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,309
You are the boss of you!

131
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,511
You march in there and
get that tattoo on your hip!

132
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,511
Go!

133
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,453
We don't get my tatoo yet,
you know it's a little tough.

134
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:48,753
How you doing?

135
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,620
I'm a twinkie!

136
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,961
Really? I'm a hero.

137
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,361
This is so hard.

138
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,673
Yeah, I know. I hate it too.

139
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,601
Look, maybe we should just tell them.

140
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,538
Maybe we should just tell
your parents first.

141
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,841
My parents are dead.

142
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,112
God, you are so lucky!

143
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,921
I mean
Well, you know what I mean.

144
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,824
Just hang in there, okay?

145
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,120
Okay, I'll go out first, all right?

146
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,865
Judy! Going to the bathroom.
Good for you!

147
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,838
Thank you, Richard.
I appreciate the support.

148
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,016
Honey.

149
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,785
Seen my Harmon Kille brew bat?
Bob doesn't believe I have one.

150
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,519
I have no idea.

151
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,486
Did you know Richard
has a twinkie in the city?

152
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,793
I know. He's a new man.
It's like a scene from Cocoon.

153
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,892
I just never would have
pictured Richard with a bimbo.

154
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,032
He told Johnny Shapiro
that she's quite a girl.

155
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,831
He told Johnny that he thinks
he's falling in love with her.

156
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,542
- Really?
- I've never seen him this happy.

157
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,209
So, Jack...

158
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,340
...ever think about trading me in
for a younger model?

159
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,583
Of course not.

160
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,409
With you, it's like
I've got two 25-year-olds.

161
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,584
Oh, Jack, stop!

162
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,656
Come on!

163
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,863
It's my birthday!

164
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,262
Can we drop this?

165
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,698
I am not interested
in the guy's apartment.

166
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,101
Oh, please. I saw the way
you were checking out his moldings.

167
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,308
You want it.

168
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,637
Why would I want another apartment?

169
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,040
I've already got
an apartment that I love.

170
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,409
It wouldn't kill you
to say it once in a while.

171
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:01,123
All right. You want the truth?
I'm thinking about it.

172
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:03,851
- What?
- I'm sorry.

173
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,960
I'm 28. I've never lived alone...

174
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:10,167
...and I'm at a place
where I got enough money...

175
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:11,936
...that I don't need a roommate.

176
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,397
I don't need a roommate either.

177
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,143
I can afford to live here by myself.

178
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:22,004
I may have to bring in somebody
once a week to lick the silverware.

179
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,308
Why are you getting
so bent out of shape?

180
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,813
We didn't agree to live
together forever.

181
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,711
We're not Bert and Ernie.

182
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,817
I am awared that we
are not gay parpens.

183
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,920
You know what?

184
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,927
If this is the way you feel...

185
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,030
...then maybe you should take it.

186
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,129
- That's how I feel.
- Then maybe you should take it!

187
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,167
Maybe I will!

188
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:47,836
- Fine with me!
- Great!

189
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,802
You can spend more quality time
with your real friends...

190
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,670
...the spoons!

191
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,805
Whose drink can I freshen?

192
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,347
Almost time for cake!

193
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,653
Mon, are you okay?

194
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:15,398
You remember that video
I found of Mom and Dad?

195
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,733
Well, I just caught the live show.

196
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,736
- Hey, there.
- What?

197
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,348
Nothing. I just heard
something nice about you.

198
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,452
Really?

199
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:40,056
- Your son isn't seeing anyone, is he?
- Not that I know of.

200
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,760
I was thinking, why doesn't
he give Monica a call?

201
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,263
That's an idea.

202
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:52,594
Well, actually,
I'm already seeing someone.

203
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,032
Oh?

204
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,940
She never tells us anything.

205
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,646
Ross, did you know
Monica's seeing someone?

206
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:06,145
Mom, there are
so many people in my life.

207
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,346
Some are seeing people
and some aren't.

208
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,315
Is that crystal?

209
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,856
So who's the mystery man?

210
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,926
Well, he's a doctor.

211
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,630
A real doctor?

212
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,026
No, a doctor of meat.

213
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,803
Of course he's a real doctor.

214
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,629
And he's handsome.

215
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,303
And he's sweet,
and I know you'd like him.

216
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,544
Well, that's wonderful.

217
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,610
Mom, it's okay.

218
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:42,819
It is, Judy.

219
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,521
Jack!

220
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,052
Could you come in here for a moment?

221
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,559
Now!

222
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,055
- Found it!
- I'll take that, Dad.

223
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:02,399
It seems your daughter and Richard
are something of an item.

224
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:06,241
That's impossible.
He's got a twinkie in the city.

225
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:08,735
I'm the twinkie.

226
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,474
- You're the twinkie?
- She's not a twinkie!

227
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,713
Look, this is the best relationship
I've been in

228
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,648
Oh, please! A relationship?

229
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,356
Yes, a relationship!

230
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,753
For your information,
I'm crazy about this man.

231
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:22,993
Really?

232
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,562
Am I supposed to stand here
and listen to this on my birthday?

233
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:33,962
This is a good thing. You said
you've never seen Richard happier.

234
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:35,068
When did I say that?

235
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:38,970
Upstairs in the bathroom,
right before you felt up Mom!

236
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,309
Happy birthday to you

237
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:46,051
Happy birthday to you

238
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:50,618
Happy birthday, dear Jack

239
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:55,616
Happy birthday to you

240
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:00,193
It looks so good!
Oh, I love it.

241
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,559
I know, so do I!
I'm so glad you made me do this.

242
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,666
Okay, let me see yours.

243
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,103
Let's see yours again.

244
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,604
We just saw mine.
Let me see yours.

245
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:18,813
Oh, no!

246
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,986
It's gone! That's so weird.

247
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,986
I don't know how, where it went.

248
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,457
You didn't get it?

249
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:31,325
Why not?

250
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,130
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

251
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,856
How could you do this to me?
This was your idea!

252
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:39,660
I know! I was gonna get it,
but he came in with this needle.

253
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,601
And did you know
they do this with needles?

254
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,469
Really? You don't say?

255
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,679
Because mine was licked on by kittens!

256
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,510
Serially, does it hurt a lot.

257
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,620
No, it's just like a pinch like that.

258
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,620
That's really hurt me,
that's gonna leave a mark.

259
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,500
I'm sorry about what

260
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,167
- Yeah, me too.
- I know.

261
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:16,472
Do we need to hug?

262
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,877
No, we're all right.

263
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,003
So I got you something.

264
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,647
Plastic spoons!

265
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,955
- Great!
- Lick away, my man!

266
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:35,285
These will go great in my new place
till I get real ones.

267
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,125
What?

268
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,994
I can't use these forever.
They're no friend of the environment.

269
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,568
No, I mean what's this
about your new place?

270
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,699
I'm moving out,
like we talked about.

271
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,905
I didn't think that was serious.

272
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,735
You know, I thought
that was just a fight.

273
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,607
Well, it was a fight...

274
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,076
...based on serious stuff, remember?

275
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,478
About how I never
lived alone or anything?

276
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,689
I think it would be good for me.
Help me to grow...

277
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,316
...or whatever.

278
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,189
Well, there you go.

279
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,230
Hey, are you cool with this?

280
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,129
I don't wanna leave you high and dry.

281
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,199
I've never been lower or wetter.

282
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,799
I'll be fine.
I'll just turn your...

283
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,600
...bedroom into a game room.

284
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,107
Put the foosball table in there.

285
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,042
Why do you get to keep the table?

286
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,847
I did pay for half of it.

287
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,185
I paid for the other half.

288
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,128
I'll tell you what.
I'll play you for it.

289
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:47,424
All right, you're on.

290
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,930
I can take two minutes
out of my day to kick your ass.

291
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,607
Your men will get scored on
more times than your sister.

292
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,706
Which sister?

293
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,451
So are you sorry that I told them?

294
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:14,785
No. It's been a long time
since your dad and I went running.

295
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,253
Did you get it?

296
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,330
- Is Ross here?
- He went out for pizza.

297
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:23,967
Okay, really quick.

298
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:26,671
That's great!

299
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,267
Very tasteful.

300
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,775
Wanna see mine? Wanna see mine?

301
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,968
What? You didn't get one.

302
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,839
Okay. Well then, what is this?

303
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,775
What are we looking at?

304
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,483
That blue freckle?

305
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,417
That's my tattoo.

306
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:48,249
That is not a tattoo.
That is a nothing.

307
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,024
I got her in the chair...

308
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:54,162
...he barely touched her with the
needle, she screamed and that was it.

309
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,058
Okay, hi!

310
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:01,695
For your information,
this is exactly what I wanted.

311
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:06,337
This is a tattoo of the Earth as seen
from a great, great distance.

312
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,075
It's the way my mother
sees me from heaven.

313
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,811
Oh, what a load of crap!

314
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,618
That is a dot!

315
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:22,519
Your mother's in heaven going,
"Where the hell's my lily, you wuss!"

316
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:27,622
That is not a tattoo!
This is a tattoo!

317
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,933
You got a tattoo?

318
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,366
Maybe.

319
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,542
But just a little one.
Phoebe got the whole world!

320
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,240
Well, let me see.

321
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,584
Well?

322
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,688
Well, it's really...

323
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:53,822
...sexy.

324
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,526
I wouldn't have thought
it would be, but...

325
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,487
...wow!

326
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:02,397
Really?

327
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,906
So is it sore?
Or can you do stuff?

328
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:11,606
I guess.

329
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:13,771
Save us some pizza.

330
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,950
Get it out of the corner!

331
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:24,947
Pass it! Pass it!

332
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,390
Stop talking to your men!

333
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,857
And the table is mine.

334
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,661
Congratulations.

335
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,641
You guys will still
come visit me, right?

336
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,612
Oh, yeah! You got the big TV.

337
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,979
We'll be over there all the time.

338
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,915
Except when we are here.

339
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,622
I know you're just moving uptown,
but I'll really miss you.

340
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:11,029
How can you not be
across the hall anymore?

341
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:15,364
Who's gonna eat all of our food
and tie up our phone lines

342
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,472
Is that my bra?

343
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:23,477
- What are you doing with my bra?
- It's not what you think.

344
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,775
We used it to fling
water balloons off the roof.

345
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,421
Remember? Those kids couldn't
even get theirs across the street.

346
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:33,449
Yeah, I remember.

347
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,330
Let's bring the rest of these
down to the truck.

348
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,168
You want me to...

349
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,840
...give you a hand
with the foosball table?

350
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,346
You keep it.
You need the practice.

351
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:03,618
Thanks.

352
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:05,812
So...

353
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:07,885
...I guess this is it.

354
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,391
Yeah, right.

355
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:10,956
I guess so.

356
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,001
When am I gonna see you?

357
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,261
I'm guessing tonight
at the coffeehouse.

358
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,937
Right. Yeah. Okay.

359
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,499
Take care.

360
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,485
Hey, dad. What are you doing here.

361
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,853
I just stop by your boyfriend
to get a piece of my mind.

362
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,458
- And.
- And I was got a punch on the nose.

363
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,460
But he has the game on,
so we started to watch it.

364
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,865
Then we have time, and
came to find out what for.

365
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,502
- But he offered me a beer,
you know what? - What?

366
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,501
He got on tap.

367
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:29,907
When he in this apartment, the
damn thing is build right on his part.

368
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:33,909
Did you talk about me?

369
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:38,482
Oh, right, actually,
we never got to you.

370
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:44,455
look, you are a big girl. I just
hope you know what you are doing.

371
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:49,460
I do. Dad, you wear the tie I got you.

372
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,464
Where did you get the hat?

373
00:23:58,537 --> 00:23:59,504
I don't know.
