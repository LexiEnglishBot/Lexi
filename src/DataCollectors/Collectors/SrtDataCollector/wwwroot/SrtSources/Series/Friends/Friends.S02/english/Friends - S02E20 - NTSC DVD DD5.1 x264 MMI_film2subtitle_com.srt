1
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:10,639
- What you guys doing?
- Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.

2
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:16,475
Why are you guys upset?
It's Old Yeller. It's a happy movie.

3
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,075
- What?
- What are you talking about?

4
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,583
Come on. Happy family gets a dog.

5
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,379
Frontier fun!

6
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,054
Pheebs, what about the end?

7
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:30,456
When Yeller saves the family
and everyone's happy?

8
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,755
That's not the end.

9
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:35,934
That's when my mother would
shut off the TV and say, "The end."

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,367
What about when he has rabies?

11
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,967
He doesn't have rabies.
He has babies.

12
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,601
That's what my mom said.

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,347
I don't think she'd want you
to see what's about to happen.

14
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,978
Why? What's about to happen?

15
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,948
I've never seen this part.

16
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,256
Hey, Travis, what you doing
with that gun?

17
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,918
Oh, no.

18
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,426
No, no, Travis, put down the gun.

19
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,389
No, no, he's your buddy.
He's your Yeller.

20
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,065
No! The end! The end!

21
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:15,833
Okay, what kind of a sick
doggy snuff film is this?

22
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:22,880
The One Where Old Yeller Dies

23
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:09,094
Have you guys eaten? Richard and I
just finished, and we've got leftovers.

24
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,389
Chicken and potatoes.

25
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,332
What am I wearing?

26
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,427
Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.

27
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,968
One of these times, you'll really
be naked and we won't come over.

28
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,073
That teach me a lesson.

29
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,814
I got a leg, three breasts
and a wing.

30
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,481
How do you find clothes that fit?

31
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,283
Hey, Monica? We got a question.

32
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:43,892
All right, yes, I see other women
in the shower at the gym.

33
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,562
And no, I don't look.

34
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,796
No, not that one.

35
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:50,932
We're figuring out who to bring
to the Nicks game.

36
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:55,698
Ross can't go, so it's between my friend
Eric Prower, who has breath issues...

37
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:59,140
...and Dan, with the poking.
"Did you see that play?"

38
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,439
"You want more beer?
Is that Spike Lee?"

39
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,516
Why don't you ask Richard?

40
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:11,985
Richard, if you had an extra
ticket to the Nicks game...

41
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,663
...and you had to choose between
a friend who smelled...

42
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:21,663
...and one who bruises you,
who would you pick?

43
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,066
Being a huge Nicks fan myself...

44
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:29,307
...I think you should take someone
who's a huge Nicks fan.

45
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,002
That's Eric.

46
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,407
Glad to be of help.
Matches.

47
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,876
I meant, why don't you
take Richard to the game?

48
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:42,980
What?

49
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,458
- I don't know.
- Come on!

50
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:51,025
He keeps his fingers to himself,
and he's always minty fresh.

51
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,924
Richard's really nice.
We just don't know him really well.

52
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,862
Plus, he's old

53
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,571
er than some people.

54
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,666
But younger than some buildings.

55
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,278
So what, he's a little older.
Big deal.

56
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,015
He's important to me.

57
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,186
If you ask him,
he might take you in his Jag.

58
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,151
How do we say yes...

59
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,862
...and make it seem like it's not
just to ride in the cool car?

60
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,223
Okay, this could be tough.

61
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,530
We'll bring him,
but only if he takes the Jaguar.

62
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,909
You almost had it.

63
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,377
No, no, you're fine. You're fine.

64
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,382
Hi, honey.

65
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,057
You are not gonna believe
what happened!

66
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,421
We were playing on the floor,
and he grabs the table...

67
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,631
...and he pulls himself up!

68
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,259
He pulled himself up!

69
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:03,969
Standing man!

70
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:08,901
I'm sorry you missed it,
but I did tape it if you wanna see it.

71
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,970
We know. He already did it last week.

72
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,280
You can watch our tape if you want.

73
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:18,883
See, I don't believe this.
I missed the first time of everything.

74
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,280
The first time he rolled over,
the first time he crawled.

75
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,818
What else? Has he spoken?
Is he driving?

76
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,615
Does he have a favorite liqueur?

77
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,385
He is getting closer
on the talking thing.

78
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,894
He can't quite say "mama" yet,
but once he said "Yemen."

79
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,967
See, I don't know.
I'm so sick of missing stuff.

80
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:41,705
I want him for more than a day.
I want him for a whole weekend.

81
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:42,940
Listen. I feel

82
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,642
That would be great.

83
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,209
Really? I had a whole speech prepared.

84
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,507
Oh, shoot, that would've been fun.

85
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,946
Did you just see that?

86
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,681
Did you see? He just waved!
He just waved!

87
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,223
He's never waved before!

88
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,657
Yes, he has. Very good.

89
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,858
What you got there?

90
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:14,003
Love Story, Brian's Song and
Terms of Endearment.

91
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:19,668
All you need now is The Killing Fields
and guacamole, and you got a party!

92
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,982
I talked to my grandma
about the Old Yeller incident...

93
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,981
...and she said my mom used to not
show us the ends of sad movies...

94
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,881
...to shield us from
the pain and sadness.

95
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,681
You know, before she killed herself.

96
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,792
Where's Richard?
Did you ditch him?

97
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,028
After we stole his lunch money
and gave him a wedgie.

98
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,998
What's the matter?
He's parking the car.

99
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,542
- Did you guys have fun?
- Your boyfriend is so cool.

100
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:55,872
He let us drive his Jaguar.
Joey for 12 blocks. Me for 15.

101
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,150
He must like you best.

102
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:03,049
What about when he tipped the guy
who showed us to our seats?

103
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,257
You never even saw the money.

104
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,824
Hey, Chandler, thanks for
showing us to our seats.

105
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,356
You're welcome. Hey, Joey,
thanks for parking the car.

106
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,259
No problem.

107
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,762
- Hey, Chandler
- I think they get it.

108
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,599
There's the man!

109
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,471
Hey, you're getting better.

110
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,712
I'm gonna keep this.

111
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:30,846
He kept my dollar.

112
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,724
Your first weekend without Ben.
What are you doing?

113
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,790
We're going to
colonial Williamsburg.

114
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:46,555
A woman I went to college with is
the first female blacksmith there.

115
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,962
They're a little behind the times
in colonial Williamsburg.

116
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,738
Look, I better go
before Mommy starts weeping.

117
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,838
- We love you.
- Bye, Mommy.

118
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,906
Have a good time.

119
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:03,512
Look.

120
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,216
Joey, do you know
we can see you from here?

121
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,318
How come Richard looks cooler
with one of these?

122
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:20,498
You may wanna light it
and lose the spatula.

123
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,270
It's cute, you trying
to be more like Richard.

124
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,302
Not like him, per se.

125
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,633
Just not unlike him.

126
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,347
It's the artist formerly known
as Chandler.

127
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,618
I'm just trying something here,
you know?

128
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,687
Why didn't you grow a mustache?

129
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,017
We flipped for it.

130
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,854
I got the cigar, he got the mustache.

131
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,224
If we both grew them,
we'd look like dorks.

132
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,796
You really sidestepped
that land mine.

133
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,065
I promised Richard
we'd meet him downstairs.

134
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:04,366
You're meeting Richard?

135
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,202
- Ranger game.
- Didn't he tell you?

136
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,742
He said he was going out with the guys.
I didn't know that was you.

137
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,140
You hear that?

138
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,146
We're the guys!

139
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,122
With that mustache,
he reminds me of Aunt Sylvia.

140
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:18,550
Thank you!

141
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,600
Hi. We're visiting.

142
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,361
It's Ben and his dada.

143
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,210
Can you say "dada"?

144
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,872
I'm telling your mommies you said it,
so you might as well.

145
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,547
No luck, huh?

146
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,081
A while ago,
I got a "seh" out of him...

147
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:51,220
...which I thought might turn into
"seh-condary caregiver," but...

148
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,957
Would you hold him for a sec?
I gotta take this off.

149
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,062
Sure. Okay.

150
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,099
What are you doing?

151
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,274
I'm holding Ben.

152
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,135
He's a baby, not a bomb.

153
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,143
Hold him like you'd hold a football.

154
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,115
This is how I would hold a football.

155
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,547
Here. Here. There we go.

156
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:27,156
Sorry, I'm not very good with babies.
I haven't been around them.

157
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,452
I mean, you know, since I was one.

158
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,357
- It's all right. No big deal.
- Really?

159
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:35,566
I'm sure you'll feel different
when it's our baby.

160
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,598
- What?
- What?

161
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,268
You think about stuff like that?

162
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,164
Yeah. I mean...

163
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:47,803
Actually, I kind of think
that we'll have two babies.

164
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,476
Two babies?

165
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,776
You know, a boy and a girl.

166
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:57,385
Hopefully, the girl will come first,
so Ben won't feel competitive.

167
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,921
Then what's gonna happen?

168
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:06,154
We won't wanna raise kids in the city,
so we'll move to Scarsdale.

169
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:11,601
We'll be far enough from our parents
so we don't have to see them...

170
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,202
...but close enough
that they can baby-sit.

171
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:18,637
And yes, I know the taxes are
a little higher than Nassau County...

172
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,879
...but the school system's great.

173
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,413
Wow, that's great! Great!

174
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,254
Okay, wow! You know what?

175
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,353
I'm off my break now.

176
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,249
Here. You take this.

177
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:40,163
I'm gonna go pour these
very nice people some coffee.

178
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,201
Look at that. I don't have a pot.

179
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,836
I don't have a pot.
Maybe I've got one at home.

180
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,369
Or in Scarsdale.
Hey, is that a door?

181
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,911
Hey, Pheebs. What's happening?

182
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,746
Murder, cancer, soccer teams eating
each other in the Andes.

183
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:07,725
I was really just need a small talk.

184
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,693
Ok, I was just fanting.

185
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,389
So you watched the movies?

186
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,165
What is happening to the world?

187
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,635
I mean...
No, no, because E.T. Leaves...

188
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,498
...and Rocky loses. Charlotte dies.

189
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,168
Charlotte who?

190
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:23,840
With the web. The spider.

191
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,044
She dies. She has babies and dies.

192
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:29,337
It's like, "Welcome home
from the hospital." Thud!

193
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,742
You wanna feel better?

194
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,956
Here. Watch this.

195
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,748
It's a Wonderful Life.
I've heard of this.

196
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,585
So you can't lose.
It's there in the title.

197
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,558
Wonderfulness is baked right in.

198
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,231
I fell for that with
Pride of the Yankees.

199
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,468
I thought I'd see a film
about Yankee pride.

200
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,603
And boom! The guy gets
Lou Gehrig's disease.

201
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,840
The guy was Lou Gehrig.
Didn't you kind of see it coming?

202
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,577
Watch that. It'll restore
all your faith in humanity.

203
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,008
Hey, big guy. Game time.

204
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,048
- Hey! Be right there!
- There's a game?

205
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:13,553
I just got my Pik-Up Stiks
back from the shop.

206
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,661
Bring your nerves of steel.

207
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,998
It's the basketball playoffs.

208
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:25,670
I appreciate this, but you don't
have to hang out with them for me.

209
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,337
They have each other.

210
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,733
Oh, no, honey. I mean, don't worry.

211
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:33,910
I like hanging out with them. They're
different than my other friends.

212
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:38,082
They don't start sentences with "You
know who just died shoveling snow?"

213
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,578
All right, that's great.
Then just go.

214
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:43,820
Go Nicks!

215
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,716
It's the college playoffs.

216
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,391
- Then, go Vassar!
- They're not in it.

217
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,424
Okay, then just go.

218
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,629
Why does this bother me so much?

219
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:59,563
I'm not one of those people who wants
to spend 24 hours a day together.

220
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,965
Sure.

221
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,300
He just doesn't have much free time.
What do I do?

222
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:08,479
Does it matter? You'll just die
or divorce or blow your pet's head off.

223
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:13,515
Me too!

224
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:17,153
Rachel, I got a question. Richard
made plans again with the guys

225
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,323
Ross made plans for the century.

226
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,594
I'm gonna go read Cosmo.
Maybe there's something helpful in it.

227
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:28,630
If not, I can learn how to do a bikini
wax with leftover Christmas candles.

228
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,535
What happened back there?

229
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,534
I don't know. You tell me.

230
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,504
One minute I'm holding Ben,
then I've got two kids...

231
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,679
...I'm living in Scarsdale
complaining about taxes!

232
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,438
Well, I'm sorry.
I think about stuff.

233
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,311
You're at work, you're assembling
bones, your mind wanders.

234
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:52,182
You've planned out the next 20 years.
We've dated for six weeks!

235
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,425
You never think about our future?

236
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,696
I think about whose apartment
we'll sleep at tomorrow...

237
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,931
...and where we'll have dinner
next Saturday!

238
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,690
I do not think about
our children's names!

239
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,696
You know what our
children's names will be?

240
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:12,209
No, I mean, you know. I read a book,
and there was a girl named Emily.

241
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,571
And I thought that might be good.

242
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:17,445
What book?

243
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,581
The Big Book of Children's Names.

244
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,347
Okay, listen.

245
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,089
What we have is amazing.

246
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,054
But I do not want
everything decided for me!

247
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,887
I spent my whole life like that.

248
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,698
It's what I had with Barry.
That's a reason I left.

249
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,934
I like not knowing right now.

250
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:40,204
Sorry if that scares you, but if you
wanna be with me, deal with that!

251
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,066
- Okay, fine!
- Thank you!

252
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,775
- We're not done!
- I didn't know that.

253
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:49,236
You're with a guy who won't stop
planning his future with you.

254
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,278
He knows we'll end up together.

255
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,575
If that scares you, tough!
You'll have to deal with that.

256
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,787
- I will!
- Good, because I love you!

257
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,556
Oh, yeah? I love you too!

258
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:01,019
- That's the first time we've said that!
- Yes, it is!

259
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,694
- I'm gonna kiss you!
- You better!

260
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,194
Thanks for the great movie tip.

261
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,303
- Did you like it?
- Oh, yeah.

262
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,977
I don't know if I was happier when
George Bailey destroyed the business...

263
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:23,179
...or Donna Reed cried or when
the pharmacist made his ear bleed.

264
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,814
I'll give you the ear thing,
but wasn't the ending wonderful?

265
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,221
I didn't watch it.
I was too depressed.

266
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,719
It kept getting worse!
It should've been called:

267
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:37,258
"It's a Sucky Life, And Just When You
Think It Can't Suck Anymore, It Does!"

268
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,465
IKick, save! And...

269
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:42,928
...denied!

270
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:47,035
He gets it back.
Pass to the middle, lines it up...

271
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:48,803
Yes!

272
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,067
Could that shot be any prettier?

273
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,301
Man, you are incredible.

274
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,309
We had a table in college.

275
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,745
Really? I didn't know they had
foosball in the 1800s.

276
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,546
Nice mustache. At puberty,
that thing will really kick in.

277
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:12,322
Not to sound too Florence Henderson,
but dinner's on the table.

278
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:13,598
One more point.

279
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:17,929
Score!

280
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,038
Now can we go?

281
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,799
That's why we don't let her play.

282
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,702
Is everything all right?

283
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,507
Don't be mad at him.
It's our fault.

284
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,718
I'm sorry we've been hogging his time.

285
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,011
He's just really great
to hang out with.

286
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,414
- Well...
- No, seriously.

287
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,182
We just talked about this.
He is so much cooler than our dads.

288
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,028
Our dads are okay and all,
but Richard is just

289
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,859
What are you kicking me for?

290
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,901
I'm trying to talk here.

291
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,240
You guys see me as a dad?

292
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,377
- Oh, yeah!
- No!

293
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:08,176
You're just clearly not familiar
with our young persons' vernacular.

294
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,546
When we say "dad," we mean "buddy."

295
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,318
We mean "pal."

296
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,357
No, seriously. Joey's my dad.

297
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,963
Monica's my dad.

298
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,232
I've even got some dads down at work.

299
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:26,770
That's fine.

300
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:31,168
Well, your other dad and I are gonna
go have a romantic evening.

301
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,445
I'll just see you kids around.

302
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,006
Nighty-night.

303
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,770
You're not a dad!

304
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,513
I can't believe you got us
into trouble.

305
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,090
So are you okay?

306
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,137
Just...

307
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,872
...I feel like I'm about a hundred.

308
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:05,202
I thought I was just one of the guys.

309
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:06,970
Come here.

310
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,873
I'll make you feel like
one of the guys.

311
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,790
For a really cool guy,
you suck at foosball.

312
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,690
I was killing them.

313
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,122
Yeah, well they suck too.

314
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,890
You take the poopy diaper
and put it in the poopy diaper pail.

315
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:35,264
Calling it a "poopy diaper"
doesn't make this process any cuter.

316
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,274
- It's us.
- Come on up.

317
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,105
I'll get his stuff together.

318
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,315
Okay, we can do this now,
can't we, Ben?

319
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,318
Yes, we can.

320
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,780
Yes, we can.

321
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,789
There! I did it!

322
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,255
I did it!

323
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,161
Look at that!

324
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,758
It stays on and everything.

325
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,401
I'm sorry. What did you just say?
Did you just say "hi"?

326
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,442
Oh, my God! Ross?
Ben just said hi!

327
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,976
- What?
- Ben just said hi!

328
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,614
What, the word "hi"?

329
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,647
No, my Uncle Hi.

330
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,617
Great! And I missed that too.
I miss everything!

331
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,587
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I just
bring it out in him.

332
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,759
- Where is he?
- We missed you.

333
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,522
We missed you so much!
Come here, Ben.

334
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,201
Guess what?
Ben just said his first word.

335
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,196
What did he say?

336
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:41,972
Something about hi.

337
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,837
That's so exciting!
Mommy's so proud of you!

338
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,173
You know, actually,
it's more like, hi!

339
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,516
This could go on for a while.

340
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,725
You're right.
We've got a cab waiting.

341
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,688
Well, this was fun.

342
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,364
We should do it again sometime, Ben.
What do you say?

343
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,992
- All right, so I've got him...?
- Tuesday.

344
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:11,331
Bye, you guys.

345
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,538
- Take care.
- Bye, Ben.

346
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,603
Did he just say "bye"?

347
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,004
He said bye!

348
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,247
You said bye!
He said bye to me!

349
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,345
Yes, he did!

350
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,142
Suddenly I'm seeing him
go off to college!

351
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,187
We've gotta go.
We've got that cab downstairs.

352
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,385
See you later.

353
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,202
Look at this nice deep hole I dug.
Hey, Bert...

354
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,675
...isn't this a nice hole here?

355
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:03,010
Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries
Bert in the sand and can't find him.

356
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:08,592
Now, I've looked ahead on the tape,
and he does find him again.

357
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:13,490
But before that happens,
there's some rough going for a while.

358
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,825
But I think we can handle it.

359
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:21,071
And there's just the alphabet,
but we know that ends well, so...

360
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:22,732
Here we go.

361
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,532
Bert? Bert?

362
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:29,869
What happened to my friend Bert?
He was here just a moment ago.

363
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,276
Oh, no! My old friend Bert is lost.

364
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,519
I'm so glad you're here.
