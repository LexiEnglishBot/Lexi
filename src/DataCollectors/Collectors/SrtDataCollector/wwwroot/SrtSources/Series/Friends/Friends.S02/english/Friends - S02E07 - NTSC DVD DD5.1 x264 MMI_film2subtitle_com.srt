1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,995
What is it about me?
Do I not look fun enough?

2
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:09,503
Is there something
repellent about me?

3
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:10,304
How was the party?

4
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:14,010
It couldn't have been worse.
A woman literally passed through me.

5
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,408
What is it?
Am I hideously unattractive?

6
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:20,613
No, you are not.
You are very attractive.

7
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,546
I go through the same thing.

8
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:25,916
When I put on a little weight,
I question everything.

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,590
I've put on weight?

10
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,900
Did you want to...?

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,336
No, not weight.
More like insulation.

12
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,738
I'm unemployed,
in dire need of a project.

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,637
Wanna work out?
I can remake you.

14
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:51,208
I would, but that might get
in the way of my lying-around time.

15
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,315
Please?

16
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:54,644
Come on, let her do it!

17
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:55,717
All right.

18
00:00:55,955 --> 00:01:00,085
If we put on spandex and my boobs
are bigger than yours, I'm going home.

19
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:01,751
Your boobs are fine.

20
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:03,495
I shouldn't have said anything.

21
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,765
Come here. Come here!

22
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,464
Can't make hands meet!

23
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:17,267
The One Where Ross Finds Out

24
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,119
Let's do it!

25
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,030
What?

26
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,969
Nothing. Just never seen
your little stretchy pants before.

27
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,803
It's cute!

28
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,674
And we're changing.

29
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,527
Come on, give me five more!

30
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:43,692
Five more!

31
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,690
Five more and I'll flash you.

32
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,400
One...

33
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,165
...two...

34
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,101
...two and a half.

35
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,870
Just show me one of them.

36
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:16,727
She's insane!

37
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,019
The woman is insane.

38
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,926
It's before work, after work,
and during work.

39
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:24,398
She's got me doing
butt-clenches at my desk.

40
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:27,572
And now they won't
bring me my mail anymore.

41
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,574
Just tell her you want to stop.

42
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,577
I can't. All she get to
work is all she can got.

43
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:37,048
So that's why I was thinking, maybe we
could all pitch in and buy her own restraunt.

44
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,383
Hey, Pheebs.
How'd it go with Scott?

45
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,850
It was nice. Took him
to a romantic restaurant...

46
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,988
...ordered champagne. Nice.

47
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,920
He still won't put out?

48
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,990
Nope. Zilch. Nothing.

49
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,353
Sorry, Pheebs.

50
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,064
Look, I don't mind taking it slow.

51
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,529
I like him a lot.

52
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,829
He's really interesting,
and he's really sweet.

53
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,938
Why won't he give it up?

54
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:06,304
Maybe he drives his car
on the other side of the road.

55
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,376
If you know what I mean.

56
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:12,345
No. What do you mean?
He's not British.

57
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,911
Maybe he's gay.

58
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,460
I don't think that's the problem.

59
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,591
We went dancing
the other night...

60
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,062
...and just the way he held me so close
and looked into my eyes...

61
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,735
I just definitely felt something.

62
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,335
But how much can you
tell from a look?

63
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,471
I felt it on my hip.
I could tell.

64
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,646
Yo, Bing!
Racquetball in 20 minutes.

65
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,285
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand
and smack her with it.

66
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:49,987
Oh, Rachel! Don't look.

67
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,154
What?

68
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,761
I don't care.
I have a date tonight.

69
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,425
You have a date?

70
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,561
Monica's setting me up.

71
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,534
What about Ross and...

72
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,100
What? My whole
insane jealousy thing?

73
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,829
Well, you know,
as much fun as that was...

74
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,268
...I've decided to opt for sanity.

75
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,511
You're okay about all this?

76
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,939
Oh, yeah, come on!
I'm moving on.

77
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,816
He can press her up against
that window as much as he wants.

78
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,781
For all I care, he can throw her
through the damn thing.

79
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,752
Hi, guys.

80
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:30,086
Monica, I'll come by tomorrow and
pick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?

81
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,994
If you say his full name.

82
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:38,001
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up
Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?

83
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,536
All right.

84
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:44,504
- You're getting a cat?
- Actually, we're getting a cat.

85
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,642
Together?

86
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,881
Both of you? Together?

87
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,616
Lt'll live with Ross half the time
and with me half the time.

88
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,950
Well, isn't that just lovely?

89
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:59,047
That's something you'll enjoy...

90
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,827
...for a really, really,
really long time.

91
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,494
Hopefully.

92
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:07,159
Look at that.
I gotta go! I got a date!

93
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,900
With a man.

94
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,231
You guys have a really good night...

95
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:16,440
...and you two have a really good cat.

96
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,215
We're not supposed to
take these when we leave.

97
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:35,183
I don't know if Monica told you, but
this my first date since my divorce.

98
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,493
If I seem a little nervous...

99
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:38,822
...I am.

100
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,265
How long do cats live?

101
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,032
I'm sorry?

102
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,271
Cats. How long do they live?

103
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,404
Figuring you don't throw them
under a bus or something?

104
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,707
Maybe 15, 16 years.

105
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,243
Well, that's just great.

106
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,113
Cheers!

107
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,011
Right. Clink.

108
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,457
Monica told you I was cuter
than this, didn't she?

109
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:15,999
No, Michael, it's not you.
Sorry. It's just...

110
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,134
It's this thing.

111
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,167
It's not as bad as it sounds...

112
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,103
...but this friend of mine is
getting a cat with his girlfriend.

113
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,277
Oh, that does sound...

114
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,780
He just started going out with her.

115
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,447
Is this guy an old boyfriend?

116
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,554
Yeah, he wishes.

117
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,660
I'm sorry. Look at me.

118
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,297
Michael, let's talk about you.

119
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:51,935
So...

120
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,332
Did you ever get a pet
with a girlfriend?

121
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,943
- So I figured it out.
- What?

122
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,308
Why Scott doesn't want
to sleep with me.

123
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,947
I'm not sexy enough.

124
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,450
Phoebe, that's crazy.

125
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,351
When I first met you,
you know what I said?

126
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,651
I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."

127
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,526
Really? That's so sweet.

128
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,798
I mean, I'm officially offended.
But that's so sweet.

129
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,670
If you wanna know what the deal is,
you're gonna have to ask him.

130
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,478
You're right. You're right.

131
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,347
You are so "yum"!

132
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:00,538
I mean, it's a cat, you know?
It's a cat.

133
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:05,406
Why can't they get a bug?
One of those fruit flies.

134
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,738
Those things that live for a day.

135
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,912
What are they called?

136
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,713
Fruit flies?

137
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,549
Thank you.

138
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,981
Would you like dessert?

139
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,386
No dessert.

140
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,885
Just the check. Please.

141
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,726
Oh, no. You're not
having fun, are you?

142
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,555
No, no, I am.

143
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:31,599
But only because I've been playing
the movie Diner in my head.

144
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,736
Oh, look at me.

145
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,299
Look at me.

146
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,103
I'm on a date
with a really great guy.

147
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,608
All I can think about is Ross...

148
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,746
...and his cat...

149
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,383
...and his Julie.

150
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,390
Look, do you want a
piece of pie or something?

151
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:58,386
Do like that man, I just
screwed this all over.

152
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:02,091
I just want to get over him.
Why can't I do that?

153
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:07,837
Look, I've been through a divorce.
Trust me, you're gonna be fine.

154
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,769
You can't see it because
you haven't had closure

155
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,736
Closure!

156
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,171
That's what it is!
That's what I need!

157
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,245
God, you're brilliant!

158
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,617
Why didn't I think of that?
How do I get that?

159
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,458
Well, there's no one way
really, it's just...

160
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,787
Whatever it takes so that
you can finally say to him:

161
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,123
"I'm over you."

162
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,031
Over you.

163
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,165
That's what it is.

164
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:39,934
Closure.

165
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,438
Hello? Excuse me?

166
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,038
Excuse me. Hel

167
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,072
- Hang on.
- Excuse me?

168
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,975
- What?
- Hi. I'm sorry.

169
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:53,481
I need to borrow your phone
for just one minute.

170
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,817
- I'm talking.
- I see that.

171
00:10:56,122 --> 00:11:00,786
One phone call, I'll be very quick.
I'll even pay for it myself.

172
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,662
You're being a little weird
about your phone.

173
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,161
All right. Fine.

174
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,491
I'll call you back.

175
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,035
Thank you.

176
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:18,042
So good people!

177
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,448
Machine.

178
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,713
- Just waiting for the beep.
- Good.

179
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,355
Ross! Hi, it's Rachel.

180
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:35,183
I'm just calling to say that...

181
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,656
...everything's fine.

182
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,129
And I'm really happy for you...

183
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,523
...and your cat.

184
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:46,060
Who, by the way, I think
you should name Michael.

185
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,341
You see there,
I'm thinking of names...

186
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,909
...so obviously I am over you.

187
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,206
I am over you.

188
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:03,420
And that, my friend,
is what they call "closure."

189
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,332
It's Sunday morning.
I'm not running on a Sunday.

190
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,304
- Why not?
- Because it's Sunday!

191
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,178
It's God's day.

192
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,981
If you say stop, then we stop.

193
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:36,552
Stop.

194
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,756
No, come on! We can't stop!

195
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,891
We got three more pounds to go!

196
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:44,119
I am the energy train
and you are on board!

197
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,808
And how was the date?

198
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,779
I think there was a restaurant.

199
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,846
I know there was wine.

200
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,123
Actually, Julie's getting a cab.

201
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:19,523
I just need the cat toys.
Did Monica say...

202
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,393
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

203
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,027
I'm sorry. I don't know, I...

204
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,868
I feel like I dreamed
about you last night...

205
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,402
...but I don't remember.

206
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,305
There they are.

207
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,210
Did we speak on the phone?
Did you call me?

208
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,850
No. I stayed at Julie's last night.

209
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:47,489
I haven't even been home yet.
Do you mind if I check my messages?

210
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,455
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

211
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,324
Rach, I got a message from you!

212
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,398
Who's Michael?

213
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:02,833
Oh, my God!

214
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:06,168
Ross, no! Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone!

215
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:09,878
Give me the

216
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,550
You're over me?

217
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,051
Oh, God!

218
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,360
- You're
- Oh, God.

219
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:23,425
You're over me?

220
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,267
When were you...

221
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,062
...under me?

222
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,302
Rachel, do you...?

223
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,810
I mean, were you?

224
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,511
What?

225
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,919
Basically...

226
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,383
...lately, I've...

227
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,952
I've sort of had feelings for you.

228
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,727
You've had feelings for me?

229
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,994
So? You had feelings for me first!

230
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,405
You know about my
You know I had

231
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,510
You know?

232
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,545
Chandler told me.

233
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,417
When did he? When did he?
When did he?

234
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,146
When you were in China.

235
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:25,886
Meeting Julie.

236
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:30,059
Julie. That's
Oh, God!

237
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:33,892
I need to lie down.

238
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:36,663
No, I'm gonna stand.

239
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,494
I'm gonna stand...

240
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:42,535
...and I'm gonna walk.
I'm walking and I am standing.

241
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,670
Now you're over me?

242
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,910
Are you over me?

243
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,794
That's Julie.

244
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,389
- Hi, Julie.
- I've got a cab waiting.

245
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,498
I'll be right down!

246
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,970
Wait, so you're going?

247
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:19,870
Well, okay, I have to.
I can't deal with this right now.

248
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,340
I mean, I've
You know, I've got a cab.

249
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,778
I've got a girlfriend.
I'm gonna go get a cat.

250
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,144
Cat!

251
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,241
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

252
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,103
How come you're watching
a rabbi play electric guitar?

253
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,639
I can't find the remote.

254
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,418
Thank you.

255
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,381
Scott asked me to come over
for lunch and I did.

256
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,423
- And?
- And we did.

257
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,391
All right! Way to go!

258
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:13,928
Yea, me!

259
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,591
So how did it happen?

260
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,632
I took your advice and
asked him what was going on.

261
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,098
What did he say?

262
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,605
He understands how sex can be
a very emotional thing for a woman.

263
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,880
And he was just afraid
that I was going to get all:

264
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:32,743
"Is he gonna call me the next day?"
And "Where is this going?"

265
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:38,585
So he said he wanted to hold off
until he was prepared to be serious.

266
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:44,354
So I said, "Okay. Relax, please."

267
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:50,226
Sex can be just about two people
right there in the moment.

268
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:54,268
If he wants to see me again, he can
call. If not, that's fine too.

269
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,907
So after a lot of talking...

270
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,077
...I convinced him.

271
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,479
Let me get this straight.

272
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,654
He got you to beg to sleep with him.

273
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:13,481
He got you to say
he never has to call you again.

274
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,386
And he got you thinking
this is a great idea?

275
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,595
This man is my god!

276
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,544
This one is cute. Don't you think.

277
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,779
Yeah. This one is cute, that one is cute.
They are all cute, they're kittens!

278
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,115
Let's just wrap one and
get the hell out of here.

279
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:46,688
- Are you OK!
- Yeah, me, sure!

280
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:55,364
You know this is the big step for us,
but I'm got feeling that will be OK.

281
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,734
I know, I know!

282
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,104
Do you have any cat really
old and incrediblly sick.

283
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,443
Rose, I don't want one suppose to die.

284
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,382
Oh, see? We should have worked
that out before we came down here.

285
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:20,122
OK, sweetie. I'm gonna narrow it down with this
one over here and this one with the stripes, OK?

286
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,494
- I have to pick?
- Whickever one you want.

287
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:32,560
I don't know. I mean
it's not easy to choose.

288
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:46,217
You know both cat are beautiful, funny.
You will be happy with either cat.

289
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,550
Do you want to take both?

290
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:58,928
I can't have two cats.
Joey is kind of guy to have two cats.

291
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,672
I didn't get a cat.

292
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,676
That's interesting.

293
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,822
No, it's not "interesting."
It's very, very not interesting.

294
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,959
It's actually 100% the
opposite of interesting.

295
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,455
I got it, Ross.

296
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,358
You had no right to say
you had feelings for me.

297
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,260
I was doing great with Julie
before I knew!

298
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,400
I was doing great
before I knew about you!

299
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,037
You think it's easy
to see you with Julie?

300
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,265
You should've said something before!

301
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,773
I didn't know then.
And how come you never said anything?

302
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,570
There was never a good time.

303
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:53,146
You only had a year.
And we only hung out every night!

304
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,314
Not...

305
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,884
...every night.

306
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,256
It's not like I didn't try.
But things got in the way.

307
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,185
You know, like Italian guys...

308
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,260
...or ex-fiances...

309
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,431
...or Italian guys.

310
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,762
There was one Italian guy, okay?
And do you have a point?

311
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,769
The point is, I don't need
this right now!

312
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,703
Okay? It's too late.

313
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,879
I'm with somebody else. I'm happy.
This ship has sailed!

314
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:26,242
You're just gonna put away
your feelings for me?

315
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:29,079
I've done it since ninth grade.
I'm good at it.

316
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,754
All right, fine.
You go ahead and do that.

317
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,284
I don't need your ship!

318
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:34,388
- Good.
- Good!

319
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:39,062
And you know what?
Now I got closure!

320
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,250
Try the bottom one.

321
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:03,646
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.

322
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,542
We're not working out.
It's over.

323
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,452
No way! With one pound to go?
Come on!

324
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:13,418
We're workin', we're movin'
We're in the zone, we're groovin'

325
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,524
I don't mind the last pound.

326
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,424
In fact, I kind of like the last pound.

327
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,428
So don't make me do anything
that I'll regret.

328
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,137
What you gonna do, fat boy?

329
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:28,897
What?

330
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:35,313
Nothing. Except tell you it's
wonderful how much energy you have.

331
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,408
Well, thanks.

332
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:41,107
Especially considering how tough
it's been for you to find work.

333
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:48,692
You can't tell your parents you were
fired, because they'd be disappointed.

334
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:56,422
It's not as if you have
a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.

335
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,095
Well, no. But I...

336
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:04,030
If it were me, I'd have difficulty
getting out of bed at all.

337
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,849
You know, I try to stay positive.

338
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:14,814
So you...

339
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,921
You feel like going for a run?

340
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,091
All right.

341
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:27,397
Because you don't have to.
You could just take a nap right here.
