1
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:04,586
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,755
Sorry I'm late.
Did I miss anything?

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,675
Joey stuffing fifteen Oreos
in his mouth.

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,011
Fifteen?

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,179
Your personal best! Ha, ha.

6
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,015
Mm-mm. Mm.

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,436
Where were you?

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,770
On a date.

9
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:24,440
I met this girl on a train
going to a museum upstate.

10
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,568
- Which museum?
- How'd you meet her?

11
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,862
No. Answer his.

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,948
We were at the back of the train.

13
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:36,535
I sat near the door
so she'd have to pass by me...

14
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:40,748
...if she wanted to switch cars.
She was totally at my mercy.

15
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:44,251
Were you so late because
you were burying this woman?

16
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:47,046
I'm late because
she lives in Poughkeepsie.

17
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:50,632
She seems great,
but she's two and a half hours away.

18
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,261
How can she be great
if she's from Poughkeepsie? Ha-ha-ha.

19
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,806
That joke would have killed
in Albany.

20
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,726
Done! I did it.

21
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,437
Who's stupid now?

22
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,449
Look! They're lighting
the big Christmas tree tonight.

23
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,660
Um, that paper is two weeks old.

24
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,331
Who keeps leaving old newspapers
in the trash?

25
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,628
I really wanted
to take Kathy to this.

26
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,965
At least you have somebody
to miss stuff with.

27
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,384
I hate being alone
this time of year.

28
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,761
Next it's Valentine's Day...

29
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,888
...then my birthday, then bang!

30
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,891
Then they're lighting
that damn tree again.

31
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,603
I want somebody!

32
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,317
You know, I want a man!

33
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:41,368
It doesn't even have to be
a big relationship. Just a fling!

34
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,746
I didn't think girls ever
just wanted a fling.

35
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,001
Let me tell you, it's been
a long time since I've been flung.

36
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,671
I know what I'm giving you
for Christmas.

37
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,011
There are nice guys in my office.
Want me to set you up?

38
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,429
Yeah.

39
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,808
I've been single a long time.
Why haven't you offered before?

40
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,686
I have a girlfriend.
I'm happy.

41
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,566
I no longer go out of my way
to stop others from being happy.

42
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,735
Okay.

43
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,528
No accountants.

44
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,199
And no one from "legal."
I don't like boring jobs.

45
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,994
And Ross was what?
A lion tamer?

46
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,499
What's wrong, Mon?

47
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,127
Everybody at work still hates me.

48
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,503
I was making headway.

49
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,924
Everyone was smiling at me,
and then I get off work...

50
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,344
...and find out they wrote this
on my chef's hat.

51
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:48,143
Maybe they meant to write
"Quiet, Bitch."

52
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,608
What's the matter?

53
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,444
Fine! Just trying to be nice.

54
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,824
I haven't been picked on this much
since kindergarten.

55
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:07,037
And they brought in someone from
junior high to do the see-saw with me.

56
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,541
Aw.

57
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,838
They're trying to make me quit.
If it were any other job, I would.

58
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,007
But I've waited for this
my whole life.

59
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,053
Wait, you're the boss.
Yell at them. Or fire them!

60
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,933
I would love to, but I can't.
I'm not good at confrontation.

61
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,518
You know what you can do?

62
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,021
I read about this director,
Orson Welles...

63
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:37,234
...who, at the beginning, would
hire somebody just to fire them.

64
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,195
Then they would all know who was boss.

65
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,533
I'm not doing anything.
Why not fire me?

66
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,204
It's a good idea.
Can you waiter?

67
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,123
Good enough to get fired.

68
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,917
All right. You're hired!

69
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,544
Hey!

70
00:04:56,421 --> 00:05:01,425
That's why I got fired last week!
Does Orson Welles direct commercials?

71
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,723
Yes.

72
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,777
I say, Drew?
Are you seeing anybody right now?

73
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,071
I'm not asking for me.

74
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,992
I'm not gay.
I'm not asking you out.

75
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,869
I'm not gay.

76
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,288
I didn't think you were gay.

77
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,040
I do now.

78
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,420
My friend, Rachel,
wants to be set up.

79
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,214
I just got out of
a big relationship.

80
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,383
I'm not looking to get serious.

81
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,970
That's okay. A fling
might be all right with her.

82
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,558
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is this "Hot Rachel"
that you took to the Christmas Party?

83
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,311
By the way, that is her full name.

84
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,730
Wow! I'm free for her.

85
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,399
Wait, I didn't say I wasn't free.

86
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,444
Let's talk it over
at the Ranger game.

87
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,822
Hold on.
I just got a box of Cubans.

88
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,533
I'll bring them
by your office at 5.

89
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:13,622
That's a little later
than I usually stay, but sure.

90
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:17,751
Before the game, we could enjoy
some eight-year-old Basil Haydens.

91
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,837
I don't know what that is,
but let's!

92
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,638
I'm writing a holiday song for everyone.
Do you want to hear it?

93
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,807
- Yeah!
- Yes!

94
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,684
Okay.

95
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,314
Happy Hanukkah, Monica

96
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,486
May your Christmas be snowy, Joey

97
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,531
Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross

98
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:51,034
Spin the dreidel, Rachel

99
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,289
- Pheebs, that's great!
- Oh, yay!

100
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,419
But you know, uh,
Rachel doesn't rhyme with dreidel.

101
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:05,507
I know, but it's so hard.
Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!

102
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,010
What are you talking about?
Lots of things rhyme with Rachel:

103
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:13,557
Bagel, mail, jail, bail, cable.

104
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,225
Maypole.

105
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,353
All good. Thanks.

106
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,775
Um, do you, maybe, have a nickname
that's easier to rhyme?

107
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,278
- Didn't your dad call you "Pumpkin"?
- Oh, yeah.

108
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,073
But did he ever call you
"Budolph"?

109
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,245
- Hello, children.
- Hey.

110
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,957
Have I got the 50 guys for you!

111
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,750
Really?

112
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,752
I showed them your picture.

113
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,964
Guys are throwing themselves at me
and giving me stuff.

114
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,966
- Knicks tonight?
- Where are the seats?

115
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,177
Wherever! I've got 20.

116
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,264
Will I like any of these guys?

117
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,391
You know, I'm going to, uh...

118
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,060
- ...play the field a little bit more.
- Chandler...

119
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,440
Guys are signing over
their 401 Ks to me.

120
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,776
You work with robots?

121
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,573
Yes.

122
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:18,079
One guy, Patrick, you'll like him.
He's nice, funny and a swimmer.

123
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,998
I like swimmers' bodies.

124
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,001
His dad made the magnetic strip
on credit cards.

125
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,836
I like credit cards!

126
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,048
I'm not bad at this!

127
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,926
- What does he do?
- He works in fine foods.

128
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:35,597
- You have a fine foods division?
- It's a big company...

129
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,892
Now, wait a second.
You make food and robots?

130
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,730
No, the robots just work for them.

131
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,983
All right, I'm going to work.

132
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,528
Does anybody have
a problem with that?

133
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,863
Yeah, lady. I do!

134
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,156
I got a problem!

135
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,492
I'll give you a problem!

136
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,786
What will you do?
Fire me?

137
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,455
You bet your ass I'll fire you!

138
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,415
See you later.

139
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,465
I should go.
I've got a date.

140
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,841
With who?

141
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:15,136
You know the girl
who lives in Poughkeepsie?

142
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,638
Not her.

143
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,224
This is someone else.

144
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,935
I can't decide between the two.

145
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,606
The one from Poughkeepsie, though
two hours away, is pretty...

146
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,276
...really smart and a lot of fun.

147
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:33,488
But this other girl,
she lives right uptown.

148
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,867
She's just as pretty.

149
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,828
I guess she's smart.

150
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,372
She's not fun.

151
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,085
If she's no fun,
why date her at all?

152
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:51,047
I want to give her a chance.
She lives so close.

153
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:55,927
And, at the end of the date,
she said something that...

154
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,222
...if she was kidding,
was very funny.

155
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,477
If she wasn't kidding, she's not fun.
She's stupid and racist.

156
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,356
- Hey.
- Hey.

157
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,693
How was your first day
at the restaurant?

158
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,737
Damn!

159
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,078
- Hey.
- Hey.

160
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,372
What happened to your fancy jacket?

161
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,249
They baked it.

162
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,792
I can't take this anymore.

163
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,171
- I'm going to fire you tonight.
- You got it. Oh, oh!

164
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,714
What are you doing?

165
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,634
You're still on fire there.

166
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,179
I think you got it!

167
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,145
Chandler, you have
the best taste in men.

168
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,440
Like father, like son.

169
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,361
Patrick and I had such
a great time last night!

170
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,905
This could, maybe, get serious.

171
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:01,117
I thought you weren't looking
for serious. Just a fling?

172
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,995
Well, you know, possibly.

173
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,793
You didn't tell him that,
though, right?

174
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,837
Uh, no?

175
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:17,592
You told this guy that
I was looking for a fling?

176
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,095
- You don't tell him that!
- Why not?

177
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,597
I'd be thrilled if some hot girl...

178
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,807
I see.

179
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,812
You telling him I want a fling
and me putting out...

180
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,940
...he's so going to get
the wrong idea!

181
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,405
Joey, could you pass the cheese?

182
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,283
I'd prefer you didn't call me Joey.

183
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,912
I thought it might be fun
to try out a cool nickname.

184
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,122
Hey, Dragon!

185
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,377
Here's your tips
from Monday and Tuesday.

186
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,296
There's $300 in this one.

187
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,007
People get generous
around the holidays.

188
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,594
And it never hurts
to wear tight trousers.

189
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,975
Could the waiters listen
to the specials?

190
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:11,020
There's Chilean sea bass
with a mango relish...

191
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,273
Why is nobody writing these?

192
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,816
We can remember them.

193
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:19,195
Because you'll make up fake specials
and make me cook them?

194
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,157
Sure, that too.

195
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:27,912
Forget the specials for a minute.
Um, here's the thing...

196
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,499
For the last two weeks I have, uh...

197
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:36,337
...tried hard to create
a positive atmosphere.

198
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,006
Can't hear you!

199
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,926
Positive atmosphere.

200
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,763
But I've had it up to here.

201
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:51,519
From now on,
it is going to be my way...

202
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,398
...or the highway. All right?

203
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,152
Does anybody have
a problem with that?

204
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,370
Hey, new guy.

205
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,833
I said, does anybody
have a problem with that?

206
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,961
No, ma'am.

207
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,090
He has a name. It's Dragon.

208
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,887
You want to know your name?
Check your hat.

209
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,431
We did the hat, right?

210
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,897
- What the hell just happened?
- I am so sorry.

211
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,524
I was going to do it.

212
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:41,361
But I was standing there
with $327 in one hand...

213
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,906
...and $238 in the other.
And I was thinking...

214
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,575
...it's been a long time since I had...

215
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,621
...327 plus $238!

216
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,751
We had a deal! It's why you're here.
I've got to fire you!

217
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,420
And I got to pay rent!

218
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,591
How about you don't fire me.

219
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,427
Instead, I stay.
I gain their trust.

220
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,014
They'll listen to the nice things
I say about you.

221
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,600
What nice things?

222
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:16,312
Nothing yet. They hate you,
and I want to fit in.

223
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,650
Happy Hanukkah,
Chandler and Monica, Merry, merry...

224
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,902
You know what, Pheebs?

225
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,905
I'm not Jewish so...

226
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,534
Ross doesn't decorate his tree
with floss...

227
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,786
...but he's not complaining.

228
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,417
Bad dream?

229
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,252
I wasn't sleeping.

230
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,964
What was Phoebe's song about?

231
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,093
It's the one with the cat.

232
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,681
I got to go.
I've got another date.

233
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,641
Did you pick one yet?

234
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,770
It turns out the one
from uptown was making a joke.

235
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:02,150
It was a different joke.
It wasn't that funny.

236
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,652
So I'm still torn.

237
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,988
You don't like the one from uptown.

238
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,991
And you're exhausted
from dating Poughkeepsie.

239
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,076
Just end them both!

240
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,996
Go to Poughkeepsie
and break up with her.

241
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,998
Then break up with uptown.

242
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,834
By the time you get home,
you're done!

243
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,254
You're right. Thank you.

244
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,592
I had a similar problem
when I lived in Prague.

245
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,679
- Prague?
- So much you don't know.

246
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,027
Chandler?

247
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,655
Patrick just, uh, ended things with me.

248
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:53,952
Did you or didn't you tell him
I wanted a serious relationship?

249
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,245
I did! I absolutely did!

250
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,247
You idiot!

251
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,750
I'm sure you're right.
But why?

252
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:05,880
You don't tell a guy that
you want a serious relationship.

253
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,049
Now you scared him away!

254
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,260
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.

255
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,472
You should never be allowed
to talk to people!

256
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,933
I know, I know!

257
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,144
Now I'm right back where I started.

258
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,896
This sucks!

259
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,148
Being alone sucks!

260
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,734
You'll meet somebody.

261
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,903
You're a great catch!

262
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:33,908
When I told those guys about you,
I didn't have to lie once.

263
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,661
- Really?
- Yeah.

264
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,415
You graduated magna cum laude, right?

265
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,375
No.

266
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,585
It doesn't matter.

267
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:51,259
I got tickets to the Ranger game.
You want to come with me?

268
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,345
Cute guys in little shorts?

269
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,847
Sure.

270
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:02,103
Actually, it's a hockey team.
Angry Canadians with no teeth.

271
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,731
That sounds fun too.
Thank you.

272
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,065
Okay.

273
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,238
Have you ever been with a woman?

274
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,991
What?

275
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,368
What is the matter with you?

276
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:21,205
There is no good time
to ask that question.

277
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,463
The station is Poughkeepsie.
Poughkeepsie!

278
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,384
Ross?

279
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,012
Wake up!

280
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,684
Ross? Ross! Ross!

281
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,647
I need more swordfish.

282
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,402
- Can you get me more swordfish?
- I don't speak English.

283
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,529
You just did.

284
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,240
I don't know what to tell you.

285
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,951
Fine.

286
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,630
Very funny.

287
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,091
Let me out, please.

288
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,676
Come on, I'm cold!

289
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,890
And covered in marinara sauce!

290
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,475
Let me out!

291
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,981
You found that handle, did you?

292
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,903
- It's not funny.
- Well, that's not true.

293
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,408
I'm a good person.
And I'm a good chef.

294
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:43,746
And I don't deserve to have
marinara sauce all over me!

295
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,666
If you want me
to quit this bad then...

296
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,709
Hey. Chef Geller?

297
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,462
You know that speech you made?

298
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,923
I got a problem with it!

299
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,845
- You do?
- You bet I do!

300
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:03,432
I just, uh, wasn't listening then,
that's all.

301
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,980
If you want a problem,
I'll give you a problem!

302
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,150
What are you going to do?
Fire me?

303
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,903
You bet I'll fire you!
Get out of my kitchen!

304
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,364
Get out!

305
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,785
All right.

306
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,746
Anybody else got a problem?

307
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,999
How about you, chuckles?

308
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,959
You think this is funny now?

309
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,210
No.

310
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:36,841
What if I dance covered in sauce?
You think it's funny?

311
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,594
No, it's really good.

312
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,431
Take those salads to table four.

313
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,433
And you, get the swordfish!

314
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,185
And you!

315
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,187
Get a haircut!

316
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:56,944
Last stop, Montreal.
The stop is Montreal!

317
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,282
What?

318
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,998
I bet myself
that you had beautiful eyes.

319
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,709
Now that I see them, I win!

320
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:15,963
What?

321
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,426
We're at my stop.
Would you like to have coffee?

322
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,349
Are we really in Montreal?

323
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:27,975
Yes, we are.

324
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,685
So coffee?

325
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,439
Coffee sounds great.

326
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,360
Wait.

327
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,528
So you live in Montreal?

328
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:43,449
No, but it's only a two-hour
ferry ride to Nova Scotia.

329
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,497
I should have thought
about my wife and kids...

330
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,041
...before I talked back
to Chef Geller.

331
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,460
Thanks.

332
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,965
It will be a lean Christmas
at the Dragon house this year.

333
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,469
Enough!

334
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,390
Lean, lean, lean!

335
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,688
Went to the store
Sat on Santa's lap

336
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,941
Asked him to bring my friends
All kinds of crap

337
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,904
Said all you need is
To write them a song

338
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:26,075
Now you haven't heard it yet
So don't try to sing along

339
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,370
No, don't sing along

340
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,790
Monica, Monica

341
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,252
Have a happy Hanukkah

342
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,131
Saw Santa Claus

343
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,801
He said hello to Ross

344
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,888
And please tell Joey

345
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:51,392
Christmas will be snowy

346
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:55,896
And Rachel and Chandler

347
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,404
Happy holidays, everybody!
