1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,629
What is it?

2
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,048
Nothing. I can't find anything
that I want to eat.

3
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:09,550
Everything makes me nauseous.

4
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,553
I'm telling you, being pregnant
is no piece of cake. Oh, cake.

5
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,764
No.

6
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,892
- Aw, honey, I'm sorry.
- God.

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,731
Ooh, what is that smell?
It's coming from the bathroom.

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,151
Wow, pregnancy does give you
some weird cravings.

9
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,862
- Yeah.
- It's me. It's Phoebe.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,990
Listen, there's something in here
I want to eat. What?

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,118
What smells so good?

12
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,371
Is it the shampoo? It's guava.

13
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,748
No.

14
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,916
- Ugh.
- Oh, wait, wait.

15
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,961
Is it my bologna sandwich?

16
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,174
Yes, yes, yes.

17
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:53,343
I can't believe it. The baby wants bologna.
The baby wants me to eat meat.

18
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:56,263
- I can't eat meat.
- Uh, wait, wait.

19
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,058
Maybe it's the pickle.

20
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,528
What are you writing?

21
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,154
Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow...

22
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,865
...and since I don't have the guts
to ask him out...

23
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,701
...I'm gonna sell him a coat
and put this note in the pocket.

24
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,328
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh.

25
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:05,749
"Joshua, give me a call sometime.
Guys like you...

26
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,335
...never go out of style."

27
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,505
What did you throw away?

28
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,552
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, what have you guys been up to?

29
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,806
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian
doorknobs at the Cooper-Hewitt museum.

30
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,432
Without me?

31
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,229
My uncle dragged us there,
but actually it turned out to be interesting.

32
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,731
- Yeah.
- They were so ornate and beautiful.

33
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:30,941
I mean, look at that.

34
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,776
I don't know how museums work
in England...

35
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,529
...but here,
you're not supposed to take stuff.

36
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,448
I, uh... I got it from the gift shop.

37
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,492
They have really lax security there.

38
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,662
It's a joke.

39
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,373
Bye.

40
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,295
Right, I've got to be off. I'll see you.
Bye-bye, then.

41
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,130
Bye.

42
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,300
Wow. Hey, you guys seem
to be having a good time.

43
00:02:56,467 --> 00:03:00,762
Oh, yeah, she is amazing,
and she's so much fun.

44
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,641
And you know what?
When I'm with her, I'm fun.

45
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,896
I even signed up for helicopter classes.

46
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,316
She's leaving in two days.
I don't have to do it.

47
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,736
- Aw, two days? You must be bummed.
- Yeah.

48
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,487
She's got to go back to London.

49
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,324
But you know what?
I've been prepared for this from the start.

50
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:24,036
We both knew we had two weeks
together and then that's it, you know?

51
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,788
Hey, that's what all
my relationships are like.

52
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,918
Yes, but in Ross' case,
they both know in two weeks that's it.

53
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,088
Pheebs, hey.

54
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,841
- Hello, hello.
- Yeah, I know. Yeah.

55
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,054
So the baby is totally craving meat.

56
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,764
This afternoon, I tried tricking it.

57
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,808
I made it a soy burger
so that maybe it'd think it was getting meat.

58
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,186
You know? And I got nauseous.

59
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,522
Well, maybe that's because
soy burgers suck.

60
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,776
Being pregnant is hard on your tummy.

61
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,820
Hey, but at least you got
that cool, pregnant-lady glow.

62
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:02,282
Oh, that's sweat. You throw up all morning,
you'll have that glow too.

63
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,794
- Okay.
- Uh, here's that trench coat you wanted.

64
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,837
Oh, great. Great.

65
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,799
- Wow, yeah, it's comfortable.
- Yeah.

66
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,302
Man, you could really
flash somebody in this thing.

67
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,055
Ha, ha. They don't want you to put
your hands in the pockets...

68
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,349
...until you are out of the store.

69
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,476
Why not?

70
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,478
Well, because...

71
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,897
...we get a lot of...

72
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,901
You know, they ruin it for everybody.

73
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,444
I know.

74
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,072
You know, I wore that cashmere sweater
on a date last night.

75
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:46,243
- Oh.
- It was the first date since the divorce.

76
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:50,330
Well, congratulations.
So do you love her?

77
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,750
No, no, no. She's nice,
but, you know, it made me realize...

78
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,004
...I'm just not ready to be dating,
you know?

79
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,381
Huh.

80
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,925
Well, uh...

81
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,177
That's, uh... That's interesting.

82
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,721
Hey, whoa, hey.

83
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,932
- What was that?
- Oh, that's just an antitheft device.

84
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,310
Then what's this?

85
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:15,731
Well, you need that too, because
obviously a thief could just tear this up.

86
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,654
Listen, we have to have a party tonight.

87
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,866
We have to have one in five minutes,
so everybody cancel your plans.

88
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,243
- What?
- Yeah, what's going on?

89
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,496
We have to have a surprise
bon-voyage party for Emily.

90
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,874
But it's actually for Joshua.

91
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,294
Look, he said he's not ready to date.

92
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,630
So I had to invite him to a party
if I wanted to see him outside work.

93
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:45,635
And now I have created
the perfect opportunity to seduce him.

94
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,639
Well, as much as I'd like
to meet Josh and warn him...

95
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,560
...Emily and I aren't gonna be here,
all right?

96
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,687
She's gonna come by first
to say goodbye.

97
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,941
And then I've got a whole special
evening planned. So sorry. No party.

98
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,735
Aw.

99
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,530
- Hello?
- Surprise!

100
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,784
Surprise!

101
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,038
No one's ever thrown me
a surprise party before.

102
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,166
Well, it was all Ross' idea.

103
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,836
You're so sweet.

104
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,297
And I'm so surprised.

105
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,928
You really didn't know?

106
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,436
There's dancin'

107
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,105
Behind movie scenes

108
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:41,066
Why are you over here
if Joshua's all the way over there?

109
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,985
Uh, because I'm trying to play
hard-to-get.

110
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,073
Oh, quick. He's looking over here.
Say something funny.

111
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,283
- Like what?
- Ha-ha-ha.

112
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,495
What's so funny?

113
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,540
I said, "Like what?"

114
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,335
Now that's a thinker.

115
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,423
Okay, you know what? This
playing-hard-to-get thing is not working.

116
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,592
Uh, hand me those cherries. Okay.

117
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,927
Okay.

118
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,808
- Hi.
- Hey.

119
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,310
- Care for a cherry?
- No, thanks.

120
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,690
You know, I can tie one of these into a knot
using just my tongue.

121
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,204
You okay?

122
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,248
You all right?

123
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,464
So we should probably get going soon.

124
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,300
Oh, but the party's only
just getting started.

125
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,095
Yeah, but we have to be at The Four
Seasons for drinks in, oh, 15 minutes.

126
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,473
And then, uh, you know,
then the Plaza for dinner.

127
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,392
So why did you plan a party
at the same time?

128
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,604
No, no, no. Ha, ha.

129
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:06,485
Actually, American surprise parties
are very short.

130
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,989
It's usually, "Surprise!" Then,
"Oh, my God, I'm so surprised. Goodbye."

131
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,368
Ross, I'm having such a great time.

132
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:19,247
Your sister has just been telling me that
you used to dressed up like old ladies...

133
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,875
...and host make-believe tea parties.

134
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,672
Monica said that, did she?

135
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,927
Oh, yeah. Then what are you going
to put on top of that?

136
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,430
- A little salami.
- Ooh, yeah. Yeah.

137
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,975
Then, um, what goes on top
of the salami?

138
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,561
- Pastrami.
- Oh, yeah.

139
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,608
You're a genius.

140
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,987
Can someone give me a hand
with the zipper.

141
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,116
Up.

142
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,540
- You changed?
- Yeah, I just needed my lucky dress.

143
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,334
- And "lucky" means "more cleavage"?
- Does for me.

144
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,014
Oh, God, look at him. He's so cute.

145
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,850
I just want to go over there and grab him
and kiss him.

146
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,478
How could I kiss him
without letting him know that I like him?

147
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,898
Hey, I know how you can get him.
Take off your bra.

148
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,858
What?

149
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,069
- There was a scene in Footloose...
- Flashdance.

150
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,823
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, with that plumber girl?
- She was a welder.

151
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,160
Were you, like, in the movie?

152
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,708
Anyway, she takes off her bra
under the shirt...

153
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,418
...and pulls it out the sleeve.

154
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,129
Very sexy. And classy.

155
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,552
Or if you wanna kiss him,
um, you could use mistletoe.

156
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,803
It's not Christmas.

157
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,805
- Or spin the bottle.
- And he's not 11.

158
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,687
Thank you so much for this.
It was really so thoughtful of you.

159
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,105
You're leaving?

160
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:11,109
- Yes, we have something we have to get to.
- Uh, yeah, I think I'm gonna take off too.

161
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,195
No, you guys, you can't leave yet.
You have to stay.

162
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:17,032
We've got the whole big thing planned.

163
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,742
What big thing?

164
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,036
So, Spin-The-Bottle
works like this.

165
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,704
I spin the bottle.

166
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,624
Lands on Gunther,
so I would have to kiss Gunther.

167
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,418
All right.

168
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,463
Who wants to go first?

169
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,922
I'll go.

170
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,263
Welcome to America.

171
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,642
Oh.

172
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,019
All right.

173
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,521
Oh, my God.

174
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:52,359
Oh, my gosh. Two in a row.
You gotta use your tongues now.

175
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,783
All right.

176
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,119
What are the odds? What are the odds?

177
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,540
Okay, that's enough, you know. Ha, ha.

178
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,752
Let's let someone else play.

179
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,923
Hey, if you didn't want to play,
then why'd you come to the party?

180
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,426
Okay, my turn.

181
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,682
Oh! Look at that.

182
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,475
Oh, my God.

183
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,730
Oh, my God. The baby just kicked.

184
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,943
It's okay, it's okay.
If it kicked once, it'll kick again.

185
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:43,284
All right, well, everybody just remember
where they were sitting.

186
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,045
It was a bug.

187
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,591
It doesn't matter
how much I'm craving it.

188
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,220
You know why I'm never gonna eat meat?
Because it's cold-blooded murder.

189
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,556
Okay.

190
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,355
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich.

191
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,525
Phoebe, what are you doing?

192
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,944
I can't help it.

193
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,030
I need the meat.
The baby needs the meat.

194
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,241
You know how when
you're dating someone...

195
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,995
...and you don't want to cheat on them
unless it's with someone really hot?

196
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,000
- Yeah, totally.
- All right, okay.

197
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,752
Well, this is the same kind of deal.

198
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,671
If you're gonna do something wrong...

199
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,382
...do it right.

200
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,640
Feel better?

201
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,976
Yeah, but at what cost?

202
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,979
Six more months, three meals a day?

203
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:57,108
I'm gonna eat like, you know,
millions of cows.

204
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,572
Hey, what if I said I could even things out
for you, meat-wise?

205
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,949
- What?
- Well, I eat a lot of meat, right?

206
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,036
- Yeah.
- But suppose, until the baby's born...

207
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,412
...I laid off it.

208
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,957
No extra animals would die.
You'd just be eating my animals.

209
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,503
Joey, I can't believe
you'd do that for me.

210
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,673
Absolutely. I could be a vegetarian.

211
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,343
There's no meat in beer, right?

212
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,429
Okay, we can still make dinner
if we skip the appetizers...

213
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,765
...and ask for our check right away.

214
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,980
We can't go now. Looks like Rachel
is going to put on a skit.

215
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,777
Oh, my God. Have you lost your mind?

216
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,280
No, no, no. I am finally thinking clearly.

217
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,201
My lucky dress wasn't working out
too well for me.

218
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,788
But for four years,
this baby never missed.

219
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,999
Rachel, wait, I can't let...

220
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,460
Actually, I kind of want to see
what happens.

221
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,130
- Hey.
- Hey.

222
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,216
Nice, uh, costume.

223
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,676
Oh, yeah.

224
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:09,180
Well, I wanted to give Emily
a big American goodbye cheer.

225
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,600
So okay. Whoo!

226
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,063
Ready. Okay.

227
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,857
- Give me an "E."
- E.

228
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,650
- Give me an "M."
- M.

229
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,443
- Give me an "I."
- I.

230
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,778
- Give me an "L."
- L.

231
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,613
- Give me a "Y."
- Y.

232
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,615
What do you get?

233
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,159
Oh! Emily.

234
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,161
Whoo! Emily.

235
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,376
Okay. That's me as a cheerleader. Ta-da!

236
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,255
- You all right?
- I just loosened a tooth.

237
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,299
It's no big deal. I have a dentist, you know?

238
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,218
I'm gonna go put some ice on it.
Excuse me.

239
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,848
- What do I do now? What do I do now?
- I think you're done.

240
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,143
Okay, time to take off the bra.

241
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,317
Uh, that was really great.

242
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,944
But I got to take off, actually.

243
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,072
Take the bra off.

244
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,328
All right, come on,
let's go get your coat.

245
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,621
Okay.

246
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,374
Rachel's my girlfriend.

247
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,380
So this was really fun.

248
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,257
Oh, yeah, it was real fun.

249
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,306
You know, this bra...

250
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,269
...is really bothering me.

251
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,481
You know, this used to be my bedroom.

252
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,149
Yeah.

253
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,695
A lot of memories in here. Lot of memories.

254
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,239
If these walls could talk,
you know what they'd say?

255
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,742
"Want to hear some memories?"

256
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,583
Need a...? Need a little hand there?

257
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,794
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I got this all under control.

258
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,298
You really don't seem like you do.

259
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,724
God. Forget it! Oh, this is...

260
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,105
This is not how
this was supposed to happen.

261
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,690
What was supposed to happen?

262
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,610
Can you not look at me when I say this?

263
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:35,368
I thought that if I could get you here...

264
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,746
...I could seduce you.

265
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:48,297
Uh, I don't wear suits to work...

266
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,009
...and I bought six of them from you.

267
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,929
Well, I'm sorry.
I thought you needed them.

268
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,518
My point is, I kept coming back
because I wanted to see you.

269
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,855
- Why?
- Because I like you.

270
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,566
You like me?

271
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,109
Yeah.

272
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:13,031
I mean, you're beautiful
and smart and sophisticated.

273
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,324
A lot of this isn't, you know,
based on tonight.

274
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,662
But you like me?

275
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.
All this time, I liked you and you liked me.

276
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,209
Oh!

277
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,046
- But...
- No don't say "but."

278
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:32,675
"But" is never good. Let's leave it
at "I like you and you like me."

279
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,136
Okay, uh...

280
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,139
- However...
- No, that's a fancy "but."

281
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:44,479
My marriage, like, just ended.

282
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:48,858
And I'm really not ready
to get into anything yet.

283
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,778
But...

284
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:57,116
I'm sorry. I just need a little time.

285
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,455
Okay.

286
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:09,337
Oh, there you are.
I was looking for you before.

287
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,548
Joshua's gone,
so you and Emily are free to go.

288
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,467
It's okay.

289
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,512
She's still in there
enjoying her fake party.

290
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,808
And, uh, it's too late to do
any of the stuff I had planned, so...

291
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,185
Ross.

292
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,604
I'm sorry.
I completely ruined your evening.

293
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,648
Ahem. Yeah.

294
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:34,237
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I made a fool of myself.

295
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,073
Helps a little.

296
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,036
Is there a room on that step
for a pathetic loser?

297
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,205
Yeah, have a seat.

298
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,713
I'm so sorry.

299
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:53,923
It's okay.

300
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,093
I mean, it was just a two-week thing
anyway.

301
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,720
I just didn't want it to end this way,
you know.

302
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,306
Or maybe you didn't want it to end?

303
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,143
What do you mean?

304
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,728
You seem to really like her.

305
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,774
Yeah, I really do.

306
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,027
Yeah, but what am I gonna do?

307
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,780
We both agreed it was gonna be
a two-week thing.

308
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,782
You know? No commitment.

309
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,077
Ross?

310
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:28,916
That girl just spent the entire evening
talking to your friends...

311
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,669
...asking to hear stories about you...

312
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,422
...looking through
Monica's photo albums.

313
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,675
I mean, you don't do that
if you're just in it for two weeks.

314
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,969
You think?

315
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:45,892
You've got, like, 14 hours
until she has to be at the airport.

316
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,519
And you're sitting here in a hallway...

317
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,898
...with a 28-year-old cheerleader
with a fat lip.

318
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,778
- Hey, you're right.
- Yeah.

319
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,035
Thanks.

320
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,374
What photo album was it?

321
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,920
I don't know. It was you
and a bunch of albino kids.

322
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,759
Oh, my God. Those weren't albino kids.

323
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,011
That was computer camp. Rach.

324
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,767
- Hey.
- Hey.

325
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,437
- You're a pathetic loser, right?
- Oh, yeah.

326
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,814
Sit.

327
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,197
Hi.

328
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,824
Oh, my God. Joshua.

329
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,701
Look.

330
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,288
All those things I said
about not being ready...

331
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,041
- They're not true?
- No, they're all true.

332
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,501
Oh.

333
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,878
But...

334
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,338
Oh.

335
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,758
Oh, I love that "but."

336
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,646
Um, do you want to go inside
and get some coffee?

337
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,856
- Yeah.
- Okay.

338
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,032
Every time.

339
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,707
- Ooh, what do you got there?
- Pastrami.

340
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,667
Yeah.

341
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,838
- Hey, you know what goes good with that?
- Mm-hm. Corned beef.

342
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,718

00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,388
- How about a little of that smoked turkey?
- Okay.

344
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,225
Oh, Mama.

345
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,021

346
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,774

00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,027

00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,279
