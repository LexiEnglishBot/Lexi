1
00:00:03,515 --> 00:00:07,110
Guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy's
putting stuff in boxes.

2
00:00:10,756 --> 00:00:13,486
l'd say our naked buddy is moving.

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,593
lronically, most of the boxes
seem to be labeled ''Clothes.''

4
00:00:18,864 --> 00:00:21,196
l'm going to miss that big
old squishy butt.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,663
And we're done
with the chicken fried rice.

6
00:00:26,038 --> 00:00:29,030
lf he's moving, maybe l should
try to get his place!

7
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:32,837
lt would be so cool
to live across from you guys.

8
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:35,170
We could do that telephone thing...

9
00:00:35,447 --> 00:00:38,007
...where you have a can,
we have a can...

10
00:00:38,216 --> 00:00:40,446
...and it's connected by a string.

11
00:00:41,787 --> 00:00:45,018
Or we could do
the actual telephone thing.

12
00:00:47,192 --> 00:00:50,628
He's got packing tape stuck
to where you really don't want it.

13
00:00:50,796 --> 00:00:53,993
Get it off, fat man! Get it off!

14
00:00:54,499 --> 00:00:57,024
Oh, no, he's trying to pull it off slowly.

15
00:00:57,202 --> 00:01:02,367
Take it from me, if you're gonna pull tape
off yourself, it's gotta be in one quick motion.

16
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,270
Like that.

17
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:07,037
The One Where Everyone Finds Out

18
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:54,281
Oh, my God. l love this apartment!

19
00:01:54,526 --> 00:01:55,857
lsn't it perfect?

20
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:59,690
l can't believe l never realized
how great it is!

21
00:01:59,965 --> 00:02:02,559
Because your eye goes
to the big naked man.

22
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:05,233
lt's amazing!

23
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,462
Hurry up with an application,
or l'll beat you to it.

24
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:17,172
Well, l'm going to use
Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.

25
00:02:22,087 --> 00:02:23,987
Look! There's Monica and Chandler.

26
00:02:25,657 --> 00:02:27,420
Hey, you guys!

27
00:02:37,936 --> 00:02:39,528
Chandler and Monica!

28
00:02:40,605 --> 00:02:41,970
Oh, my God!

29
00:02:45,277 --> 00:02:46,266
Oh, my eyes!

30
00:02:46,511 --> 00:02:47,535
My eyes!

31
00:02:49,548 --> 00:02:50,606
lt's okay!

32
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:52,817
-They're doing it!
-l know!

33
00:02:53,018 --> 00:02:54,986
-l know!
-You know?

34
00:02:55,287 --> 00:02:59,121
Yes, l know it. Joey knows,
but Ross doesn't, so stop screaming!

35
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:00,716
What's going on?

36
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:05,160
-What?
-Nothing!

37
00:03:05,397 --> 00:03:08,366
We are so excited
that you'll get this apartment!

38
00:03:08,934 --> 00:03:09,923
Looks really good.

39
00:03:10,168 --> 00:03:11,999
Looks pretty good!

40
00:03:13,138 --> 00:03:14,162
Get in here!
Come on!

41
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,780
You mean whenever
Monica and Chandler...

42
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:28,146
...were doing laundry
or going grocery shopping?

43
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:31,480
The time Monica spent on the phone
with Linda from camp?

44
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:34,055
Doing it, doing it, phone, doing it.

45
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:36,856
l can't believe it!

46
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:39,529
l think it's great. For him.

47
00:03:39,798 --> 00:03:41,288
She could do better.

48
00:03:43,368 --> 00:03:44,357
Hey, you guys.

49
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:45,830
Come here!

50
00:03:46,204 --> 00:03:48,365
Phoebe found out
about Monica and Chandler.

51
00:03:48,673 --> 00:03:51,141
You mean how they're friends
and nothing more?

52
00:03:53,478 --> 00:03:54,911
Joey, she knows.

53
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:58,241
We saw them doing it
through the window.

54
00:03:59,084 --> 00:04:02,383
Actually, we saw them doing it
up against the window.

55
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:06,181
We saw them fornicating.

56
00:04:08,827 --> 00:04:12,228
So they know you know,
and they don't know that Rachel knows?

57
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,490
Yes, but it doesn't matter
who knows what.

58
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:19,197
Now enough of us know
that we could just tell them we know.

59
00:04:19,437 --> 00:04:22,406
All the lying and the secrets
will finally be over.

60
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:26,404
Or, we could not tell them we know,
and have a little fun.

61
00:04:28,513 --> 00:04:29,605
What do you mean?

62
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:33,750
lf they say they are doing laundry,
we'll give them laundry to do.

63
00:04:35,587 --> 00:04:37,612
l would enjoy that.

64
00:04:38,256 --> 00:04:41,350
You know what would be even more fun?
Telling them.

65
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:45,394
-That doesn't sound like fun.
-So we'll make it fun.

66
00:04:45,564 --> 00:04:48,590
We'll do it like a barbershop quartet!

67
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,861
<i>We know, we know, we know</i>

68
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:56,507
No, l want to do Phoebe's thing.

69
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:57,697
l can't take--

70
00:04:57,876 --> 00:05:01,471
You don't have to do anything.
Just don't tell them we know.

71
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,443
l can't take anymore secrets.

72
00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:06,879
l got your secrets, their secrets,
secrets of my own.

73
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,551
You don't have any secrets.

74
00:05:11,723 --> 00:05:15,352
Well, you don't know about Hugsy,
my bedtime penguin pal.

75
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:24,201
How are we going to mess with them?

76
00:05:24,636 --> 00:05:27,127
You could use your position
as the roommate.

77
00:05:27,372 --> 00:05:30,967
And l would use the strongest tool
at my disposal.

78
00:05:31,243 --> 00:05:32,904
My sexuality.

79
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:35,640
Hello, children.

80
00:05:37,015 --> 00:05:39,245
Watch. Learn.
And don't eat my cookie.

81
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:46,489
That jacket looks great on you.

82
00:05:47,325 --> 00:05:49,520
-Really?
-The material is so soft.

83
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:51,525
Hello, Mr. Bicep.

84
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:55,157
You're working out?

85
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:57,424
l try to squeeze things.

86
00:06:03,842 --> 00:06:05,241
Are you okay?

87
00:06:05,443 --> 00:06:07,604
lf you really want to know--

88
00:06:07,846 --> 00:06:09,370
l can't tell you this.

89
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:12,077
You can tell me anything.

90
00:06:12,284 --> 00:06:15,447
Actually, you are the one person
l can't tell this to.

91
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,280
And the one person l want to the most.

92
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:22,185
What's going on?

93
00:06:23,461 --> 00:06:26,624
l just haven't been
with a guy in so long...

94
00:06:26,932 --> 00:06:29,457
...and sometimes you're
looking for something...

95
00:06:29,734 --> 00:06:33,397
...and it's right there
in front of you, sipping coffee....

96
00:06:33,638 --> 00:06:35,936
Oh, no. Have l said too much?

97
00:06:38,443 --> 00:06:41,606
Just something to think about.
l know l will.

98
00:06:54,893 --> 00:06:56,554
You are so cute.

99
00:06:57,128 --> 00:06:59,460
How did you get to be so cute?

100
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:01,961
My grandfather was Swedish.

101
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:04,795
And my grandmother was
a tiny little bunny.

102
00:07:06,604 --> 00:07:08,834
Now you're even cuter.

103
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:14,241
You know, that is a popular
opinion today, l must say.

104
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,107
The weirdest thing happened
at the coffeehouse.

105
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:18,907
Phoebe was hitting on me.

106
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:21,846
What are you talking about?

107
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,111
l think Phoebe thinks l'm foxy.

108
00:07:27,926 --> 00:07:28,915
lt's not possible.

109
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:36,801
l'm sorry, Phoebe's just
always thought you were charming...

110
00:07:37,002 --> 00:07:39,095
...in a sexless kind of way.

111
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:42,204
You know, l can't hear that enough.

112
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,771
l just think you misunderstood her.

113
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:48,605
l didn't, okay?
She was all over me.

114
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,144
She touched my bicep,
for crying out loud.

115
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:52,839
This bicep?

116
00:07:53,351 --> 00:07:56,013
Well, it's not flexed right now.

117
00:07:59,858 --> 00:08:02,827
Why is it so hard for you to believe
that Phoebe could be attracted to me?

118
00:08:02,994 --> 00:08:04,552
lt's not.

119
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:07,562
All the girls are attracted to you.

120
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:09,927
You're part bunny.

121
00:08:14,973 --> 00:08:17,498
Mon, you want to come
see a movie with us?

122
00:08:18,743 --> 00:08:21,576
Actually, l was going
to do some laundry.

123
00:08:24,282 --> 00:08:25,647
Want to do it with me?

124
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,841
Sure, l'll do it with you.

125
00:08:29,154 --> 00:08:31,486
Okay, great.
Hold on a second.

126
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:35,589
Here you go.

127
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:39,820
That would really help me out a lot.
Thanks.

128
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,657
You know what?
l don't have enough quarters.

129
00:08:43,868 --> 00:08:45,699
l have quarters!

130
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,033
Great. Now we can do laundry all night.
All night laundry!

131
00:08:56,114 --> 00:08:58,309
Hey, any word on the apartment yet?

132
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,111
l called there, and it turns out
Naked Guy is subletting it.

133
00:09:02,387 --> 00:09:04,184
He's already had 1 00 applicants.

134
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:06,323
-Oh, man.
-No, no, it's okay.

135
00:09:06,491 --> 00:09:10,052
Because you know what the difference
between them and me is?

136
00:09:10,228 --> 00:09:12,287
Your history of bedwetting?

137
00:09:13,064 --> 00:09:15,498
Hey, l trusted you, man!

138
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:19,261
Anyway, the difference is...

139
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:20,802
...l've got the edge.

140
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:23,701
lt's not exactly ethical,
but l sent him a bribe...

141
00:09:24,008 --> 00:09:26,499
...to tip the scales in my direction.

142
00:09:26,778 --> 00:09:28,302
You can see it from the window.

143
00:09:31,516 --> 00:09:34,781
ls it that pinball machine
with the big bow on it?

144
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:38,518
That new mountain bike?

145
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:42,955
What did you send?

146
00:09:43,228 --> 00:09:45,992
A basket of mini muffins.

147
00:09:47,132 --> 00:09:51,466
There's a whole table of them.
Which one did you send?

148
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:53,728
The small one.

149
00:09:54,472 --> 00:09:59,341
You actually thought that basket
was going to get you the apartment?

150
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:04,310
Someone sent us a basket at work, and
people went crazy over those muffins.

151
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:06,143
lt was the best day.

152
00:10:06,384 --> 00:10:08,579
Your work makes me sad.

153
00:10:10,088 --> 00:10:13,148
Oh, man, l want that place so much!

154
00:10:13,358 --> 00:10:16,054
And l was so sure
that was going to work.

155
00:10:16,327 --> 00:10:19,387
There's 1 2 bucks
l'll never see again.

156
00:10:20,265 --> 00:10:22,699
We'd better go if we want
to catch that movie.

157
00:10:23,535 --> 00:10:25,025
Bye.

158
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,203
Bye, Chandler.
l miss you already.

159
00:10:33,411 --> 00:10:36,244
Did you see that? The inappropriate,
and the pinching?

160
00:10:36,514 --> 00:10:37,606
Actually, l did.

161
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:40,340
So do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

162
00:10:42,387 --> 00:10:45,379
Oh, my God!
She knows about us!

163
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,579
Are you serious?

164
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:49,124
She knows, and she's trying
to freak us out!

165
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,718
That's the only explanation!

166
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:59,365
But what about my pinchable butt
and my bulging biceps?

167
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:01,064
She knows!

168
00:11:12,617 --> 00:11:14,141
Phoebe knows about us.

169
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:16,111
l didn't tell them!

170
00:11:16,554 --> 00:11:17,646
Them?

171
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:19,220
Who's ''them''?

172
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:22,958
Phoebe and Joey.

173
00:11:26,664 --> 00:11:27,653
And Rachel.

174
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:31,464
l would have told you,
but l promised not to tell.

175
00:11:31,703 --> 00:11:32,692
l'm sorry.

176
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,497
But it's over now, right?

177
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:39,199
You can tell them you know they know,
and l can go back to knowing nothing!

178
00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:42,177
Unless--

179
00:11:42,413 --> 00:11:44,813
Not ''unless'' !
This must end now!

180
00:11:45,216 --> 00:11:48,708
They think they are so slick
messing with us.

181
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,048
But they don't know
that we know that they know.

182
00:11:53,491 --> 00:11:54,480
So--

183
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:58,526
The messers become the messees!

184
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:03,558
Come on, you guys.
Think how much fun it would be to tell.

185
00:12:03,735 --> 00:12:06,568
<i>We know, we know, we know</i>

186
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:10,538
What?

187
00:12:11,876 --> 00:12:13,639
Oh, that wasn't you.

188
00:12:17,982 --> 00:12:20,450
Honey, you got to stop
torturing yourself.

189
00:12:20,685 --> 00:12:22,676
Why don't you find another apartment?

190
00:12:22,987 --> 00:12:25,785
l've already looked
at 1 000 apartments this month.

191
00:12:26,024 --> 00:12:28,356
None of them even compares
to that one.

192
00:12:28,526 --> 00:12:33,122
Well, except for one, but l would have had
to share it with an Armenian family.

193
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:35,789
Grandma really liked me.

194
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:39,534
But l want Ugly Naked apartment!

195
00:12:40,305 --> 00:12:41,567
You know what?

196
00:12:41,806 --> 00:12:45,936
You should find out his hobbies
and use that to bond with him.

197
00:12:46,144 --> 00:12:48,078
Like if l wanted something from Joey...

198
00:12:48,313 --> 00:12:52,477
...l would strike up a conversation
about sandwiches...

199
00:12:54,852 --> 00:12:56,547
...or my underwear.

200
00:12:57,555 --> 00:12:58,920
l'm listening.

201
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:04,392
That is a great idea!

202
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:09,191
And l know Ugly Naked Guy because
we've been watching him for five years.

203
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,563
So that gives me back my edge!

204
00:13:13,071 --> 00:13:15,835
Let's see now.
He had the trampoline.

205
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:16,996
He broke that.

206
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:20,836
-He had gravity boots.
-He broke those too.

207
00:13:21,245 --> 00:13:24,237
So he likes to break stuff.

208
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:30,677
l've got to go pick up Ben.
But l will figure something out.

209
00:13:30,922 --> 00:13:32,719
Didn't he used to have a cat?

210
00:13:32,957 --> 00:13:35,687
l wouldn't bring that up.
lt would bum him out.

211
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:38,725
Poor cat never saw
that big butt coming.

212
00:13:44,635 --> 00:13:46,933
Hold on a second,
she's right here.

213
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:48,094
lt's Chandler.

214
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,210
Hello, you.

215
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:56,744
Phoebe, l've been thinking
about you all day.

216
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:03,717
You know that thing you said before?
l was intrigued.

217
00:14:04,122 --> 00:14:05,282
Really?

218
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,151
Joey won't be here tonight.

219
00:14:07,392 --> 00:14:11,123
Why don't you come over?
l'll let you feel my bicep.

220
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:13,420
Or maybe more.

221
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:18,231
l'll have to get back to you on that.

222
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:23,941
He wants me to come over
and feel his bicep and more!

223
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:26,135
Are you kidding?

224
00:14:26,344 --> 00:14:28,835
l cannot believe
he would do that to Mon--

225
00:14:37,655 --> 00:14:40,453
Joey? Do they know that we know?

226
00:14:43,294 --> 00:14:44,124
They know you know.

227
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:45,852
l knew it!

228
00:14:47,732 --> 00:14:50,963
l would say, ''Thank God!
Everybody knows! lt's finally over!''

229
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,865
But that hasn't been working for me.

230
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:56,439
l cannot believe those two!

231
00:14:56,607 --> 00:15:00,407
They thought they could mess with us?
Trying to mess with us?

232
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,774
They don't know that we know
they know we know.

233
00:15:07,518 --> 00:15:09,418
Joey, you can't say anything.

234
00:15:09,787 --> 00:15:11,516
Couldn't if l wanted to.

235
00:15:18,496 --> 00:15:23,399
Good evening, sir. l'm Ross Geller.
l'm one of the applicants.

236
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:27,662
l realize that the competition
is fierce but....

237
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:33,937
l'm sorry, l can't help but notice
that you're naked.

238
00:15:37,782 --> 00:15:39,340
l applaud you.

239
00:15:39,617 --> 00:15:42,484
Man, l wish l was naked.

240
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,156
l mean, this looks so great.

241
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:49,152
That is how God intended it.

242
00:15:51,762 --> 00:15:53,457
Look. They're panicked!

243
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:55,030
They'll totally back down.

244
00:15:56,934 --> 00:15:59,767
lf he wants a date,
he's going to get a date.

245
00:16:00,037 --> 00:16:01,595
l'm going to go in.

246
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:03,272
Be sexy.

247
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:05,833
Please.

248
00:16:17,355 --> 00:16:19,619
l'd love to come by tonight.

249
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:24,517
Really?

250
00:16:24,729 --> 00:16:26,856
Absolutely.
Say, around 7?

251
00:16:31,335 --> 00:16:35,328
l'm really looking forward to you
and me having sexual intercourse.

252
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:42,846
Hey, check it out!

253
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:44,878
Naked Guy's got a naked friend.

254
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:57,324
Oh, my God!
That's our friend!

255
00:16:58,095 --> 00:17:00,188
lt's Naked Ross!

256
00:17:03,968 --> 00:17:06,436
Would you like another mini muffin?

257
00:17:06,604 --> 00:17:09,505
Try the blueberry, they're delicious.

258
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:18,508
Showtime!

259
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,540
Rachel, get me perfume.

260
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:23,685
Joey, can you get me
a bottle of wine and glasses?

261
00:17:32,096 --> 00:17:37,033
All right, thanks, but glasses that do not
have handles and that are glass.

262
00:17:37,234 --> 00:17:40,135
And wine that is not olive oil.

263
00:17:41,739 --> 00:17:45,971
Make her think you want to have
sex with her and it will freak her out.

264
00:17:47,778 --> 00:17:50,076
How far am l gonna have to go with her?

265
00:17:50,314 --> 00:17:52,282
She'll give in way before you do.

266
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,439
How do you know?

267
00:17:53,651 --> 00:17:56,950
Because you're on my team.
My team always wins.

268
00:17:58,322 --> 00:18:00,290
At this?

269
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:03,350
Just go get some! Go!

270
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:08,125
Now, l'm going to try to listen
from right here.

271
00:18:08,332 --> 00:18:09,594
Oh, wait.

272
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:11,529
Good idea.

273
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:13,964
Don't give away the farm.

274
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:25,037
Come on in.

275
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,642
l was going to.

276
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:32,986
l brought some wine.
Would you like some?

277
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,452
Sure.

278
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:43,966
So here we are.

279
00:18:44,235 --> 00:18:45,327
Nervous?

280
00:18:45,536 --> 00:18:47,026
Me? No. You?

281
00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:49,203
l want this to happen.

282
00:18:51,475 --> 00:18:52,499
So do l.

283
00:19:06,524 --> 00:19:08,549
l'm going to put on some music.

284
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:17,464
Joey likes to scare the duck.

285
00:19:21,238 --> 00:19:23,900
Maybe l'll dance for you.

286
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,917
You look good.

287
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:46,894
Thanks.

288
00:19:47,531 --> 00:19:51,399
You know, when you say
things like that, it makes me...

289
00:19:51,702 --> 00:19:55,399
...want to rip that
sweater vest right off.

290
00:19:57,308 --> 00:19:59,208
Why don't we move into the bedroom?

291
00:19:59,376 --> 00:20:00,365
Really?

292
00:20:00,578 --> 00:20:02,569
Do you not want to?

293
00:20:04,315 --> 00:20:07,443
First l want to take off
all my clothes...

294
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:10,916
...and have you rub lotion on me.

295
00:20:11,922 --> 00:20:13,719
That would be nice.

296
00:20:16,594 --> 00:20:18,494
l'll go get the lotion.

297
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,594
lt's way out of hand.
She wants me to put lotion on her!

298
00:20:25,803 --> 00:20:28,499
-She's bluffing!
-She's not backing down.

299
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:30,400
She went like this--

300
00:20:32,676 --> 00:20:35,509
He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.

301
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,907
lt's Chandler. You can take him.

302
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:41,540
Come on. Don't you remember when
you made him cry using only your words?

303
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:46,980
Aren't you guys done yet?

304
00:20:47,224 --> 00:20:49,385
l want to sit in my chair!

305
00:20:50,327 --> 00:20:54,821
The sooner Phoebe breaks him, the sooner
it's over and out in the open.

306
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:56,964
l like that.

307
00:20:58,235 --> 00:21:02,035
Show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.

308
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,038
You didn't rip off any buttons.

309
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:13,739
lt's not my first time.

310
00:21:16,153 --> 00:21:19,054
Go back there and seduce her
till she cracks!

311
00:21:19,256 --> 00:21:20,723
Give me a second.

312
00:21:21,592 --> 00:21:24,493
-Did you clean up in here?
-Of course!

313
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:31,663
You're going?

314
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:34,060
Not without you, lover.

315
00:21:39,176 --> 00:21:42,373
So this is my bra.

316
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,282
lt's very, very nice.

317
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:52,416
Well, come here.

318
00:21:52,957 --> 00:21:55,619
l'm very happy we're going
to have all the sex.

319
00:21:57,294 --> 00:22:00,695
You should be.
l'm very bendy.

320
00:22:05,436 --> 00:22:06,733
l'll kiss you now.

321
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:08,802
Not if l kiss you first.

322
00:22:29,093 --> 00:22:31,994
l guess there's nothing
left for us to do but kiss.

323
00:22:32,897 --> 00:22:34,592
Here it comes.

324
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:37,323
Our first kiss.

325
00:22:47,778 --> 00:22:48,802
You win!

326
00:22:50,047 --> 00:22:51,036
l can't have sex with you!

327
00:22:51,215 --> 00:22:53,240
-And why not?
-l'm in love with Monica!

328
00:22:53,484 --> 00:22:54,849
You're what?

329
00:22:57,187 --> 00:22:58,176
Love her!

330
00:22:58,589 --> 00:22:59,817
l love her!

331
00:23:00,024 --> 00:23:02,549
l love her!

332
00:23:06,997 --> 00:23:08,828
l love you, Monica.

333
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:11,724
l love you too, Chandler.

334
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:20,774
l thought you were doing it.
l didn't know you were in love!

335
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:25,342
Dude!

336
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,341
Hats off to Phoebe.
Quite a competitor.

337
00:23:31,288 --> 00:23:33,552
May l say your breasts are still showing.

338
00:23:33,724 --> 00:23:34,884
God.

339
00:23:36,093 --> 00:23:37,651
All right!
So that's it?

340
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:39,590
lt's over.
Everybody knows!

341
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,388
Actually, Ross doesn't.

342
00:23:41,598 --> 00:23:44,066
We'd appreciate it
if no one told him yet.

343
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:53,867
Well, here it is.

344
00:23:54,044 --> 00:23:56,069
A new place for a new Ross.

345
00:23:56,347 --> 00:24:00,113
l'll have you and the guys from work
over, once it's furnished.

346
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:02,444
lt's nice to see you
back on your feet.

347
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,679
l am that, and the whole rage thing
is definitely behind me.

348
00:24:06,924 --> 00:24:10,052
l wonder if it's time for you
to rejoin our museum team?

349
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,625
That would be great.

350
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:15,228
l am totally ready
to come back to work.

351
00:24:21,271 --> 00:24:23,364
