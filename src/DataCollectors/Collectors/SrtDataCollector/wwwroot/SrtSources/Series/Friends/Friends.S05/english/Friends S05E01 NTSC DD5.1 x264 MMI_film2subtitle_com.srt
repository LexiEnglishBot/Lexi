1
00:00:02,314 --> 00:00:05,977
Friends, family,
we're gathered to celebrate...

2
00:00:06,251 --> 00:00:09,084
...the joyous union of Ross and Emily.

3
00:00:09,988 --> 00:00:12,218
Now, Ross, repeat after me.

4
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:14,214
''l, Ross.''

5
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:15,619
l, Ross.

6
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:17,451
''Take thee, Emily.''

7
00:00:17,729 --> 00:00:19,287
Take thee, Rachel.

8
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:31,638
Shall l go on?

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,775
He said, ''Rachel,'' right?

10
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:36,277
Do you think l should go up there?

11
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:38,949
Yes. Yes. Do go on.

12
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:41,449
l think we'd better start again.

13
00:00:42,654 --> 00:00:44,178
Repeat after me.

14
00:00:44,423 --> 00:00:45,481
''l, Ross.''

15
00:00:45,757 --> 00:00:46,985
l, Ross.

16
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:49,284
''Take thee, Emily.''

17
00:00:52,664 --> 00:00:54,928
Take thee, Emily.

18
00:00:57,002 --> 00:00:58,970
Like there'd be anybody else.

19
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:04,268
''As my lawfully wedded wife,
in sickness and in health...

20
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:06,101
...till death parts us.''

21
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:11,044
As my lawfully wedded wife,
in sickness and in health...

22
00:01:11,316 --> 00:01:13,876
...until death parts us.

23
00:01:14,186 --> 00:01:16,381
Really, l do. Emily.

24
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:18,654
Do you have the rings?

25
00:01:21,126 --> 00:01:23,321
Place this ring on Ross' finger...

26
00:01:23,562 --> 00:01:26,326
...as a symbol of
your bond everlasting.

27
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:34,336
Ross, place this ring...

28
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:36,564
...on Emily's hand as a symbol...

29
00:01:36,808 --> 00:01:39,242
...of the love that
encircles you forever.

30
00:01:39,978 --> 00:01:41,206
Happy to.

31
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:45,408
They have made
their declarations...

32
00:01:45,684 --> 00:01:50,246
...and it gives me great pleasure
to declare them husband and wife.

33
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:54,356
You may kiss the bride.

34
00:01:59,231 --> 00:02:02,530
This is worse than when
he married the lesbian.

35
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:08,700
Just keep smiling.

36
00:02:12,944 --> 00:02:15,242
Well, that went well.

37
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:19,009
lt could've been worse.
He could've shot her.

38
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:24,349
That was pretty funny, wasn't it?

39
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,559
The One After Ross Says ''Rachel''

40
00:03:14,606 --> 00:03:17,234
You spoiled everything!
lt's a nightmare!

41
00:03:17,442 --> 00:03:21,936
My friends and family are out there!
How can l face them?

42
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:24,374
No matter what happens with them...

43
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:26,106
...we still get cake, right?

44
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,353
That's all right. You take your time.
l'll be right out here.

45
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,192
She's just fixing her makeup.

46
00:03:37,562 --> 00:03:38,551
l hate you!

47
00:03:38,797 --> 00:03:41,459
And l love you!

48
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:46,360
A bad time
to say the wrong name, huh?

49
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,940
That's true. Thanks, Dad.

50
00:03:52,944 --> 00:03:55,037
People should be dancing.

51
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:57,909
This is a party! Come on!

52
00:03:58,116 --> 00:03:59,743
Joey! Dance!

53
00:04:11,963 --> 00:04:13,897
Yes, Waltham lnteriors.

54
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,661
This is Ross Geller's
personal physician, Dr. Filangie.

55
00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:21,561
Who?

56
00:04:21,773 --> 00:04:25,641
l discovered that Ross forgot
to take his brain medicine.

57
00:04:25,844 --> 00:04:28,506
Without it, in the brain of Ross...

58
00:04:28,747 --> 00:04:31,944
...women's names are interchangeable.

59
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:34,311
Through no fault of his own.

60
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,417
Oh, my God! Phoebe.

61
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:40,856
No, not Phoebe. Dr. Filangie.

62
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:43,117
Oh, no! You have it too!

63
00:04:45,564 --> 00:04:48,397
What kind of bitch hangs up
on a doctor?

64
00:04:56,708 --> 00:05:00,200
l hope you don't take this
the wrong way...

65
00:05:00,445 --> 00:05:03,346
...but l know we had plans
to meet up tonight.

66
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:07,051
l'm worried about what it
might do to our friendship.

67
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:09,213
l know.

68
00:05:10,055 --> 00:05:13,547
-How could we have let this happen?
-Seven times!

69
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,358
You know, look.
We were away.

70
00:05:18,697 --> 00:05:21,689
ln a foreign, romantic country.

71
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:23,633
l blame London.

72
00:05:23,835 --> 00:05:25,234
Bad London!

73
00:05:26,872 --> 00:05:27,896
So look...

74
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,176
...while we're still in London,
we can keep doing it, right?

75
00:05:32,377 --> 00:05:34,868
Well, l don't see that
we have a choice.

76
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:38,009
But when we're back home,
we don't do it.

77
00:05:38,216 --> 00:05:39,581
Only here.

78
00:05:41,186 --> 00:05:43,586
You know, l saw
a wine cellar downstairs.

79
00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:46,547
l'll meet you there in two minutes.

80
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,994
Mon? l gotta ask you something.

81
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:52,252
Now?

82
00:05:52,497 --> 00:05:56,695
Ross said my name.
l can't just pretend it didn't happen.

83
00:05:57,202 --> 00:05:58,567
l don't know.

84
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:00,932
Monica, what should l do?

85
00:06:01,673 --> 00:06:03,800
Just do the right thing.

86
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:06,238
What?

87
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:09,505
Tow the line! Thread the needle!
Think outside the box!

88
00:06:09,714 --> 00:06:12,911
l'll talk to Ross
about what he thinks it meant.

89
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:15,412
Wait! Rachel, no.

90
00:06:15,687 --> 00:06:16,711
He's married.

91
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:18,517
Married.

92
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:21,715
lf you don't realize that,
l can't help you.

93
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:23,895
Okay. You're right.

94
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:26,586
You're right.
You can't help me.

95
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:31,733
Jack, is it all our fault?
Were we bad parents?

96
00:06:33,905 --> 00:06:36,897
Who serves steak
when there's no place to sit?

97
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:38,905
How are you supposed to eat this?

98
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,577
Hey, what's up?

99
00:06:43,148 --> 00:06:44,809
You and me, next dance?

100
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,883
Sorry, dear,
l only dance when l'm drunk.

101
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:50,112
Want me to get you something?

102
00:06:52,157 --> 00:06:53,886
We were supposed to meet.

103
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,116
-Forget it. That's off.
-Why?

104
00:06:56,394 --> 00:06:59,420
The next tour of the wine cellar...

105
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:03,833
...will commence in two minutes.

106
00:07:05,737 --> 00:07:07,261
Joey, what are you doing?

107
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:09,633
You promised, no meat
till Phoebe has the babies.

108
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:12,605
We're in another country,
so it doesn't count.

109
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:15,174
-True.
-He's got a point.

110
00:07:21,086 --> 00:07:22,917
l'm sorry things aren't working out.

111
00:07:24,255 --> 00:07:27,452
lt could be better.
lt'll be okay, right?

112
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:30,787
Oh, yeah! Of course.
She'll get over this.

113
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:32,462
So you said my name.

114
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:35,258
You just said it
because you saw me there.

115
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:38,095
lf you'd seen a circus freak,
you would've said:

116
00:07:38,336 --> 00:07:40,270
''l take thee, Circus Freak.''

117
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,170
lt didn't mean anything.
lt's a mistake.

118
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:47,709
lt didn't mean anything.
Right?

119
00:07:47,946 --> 00:07:51,814
Oh, no! Of course
it didn't mean anything.

120
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,383
l can understand why Emily
thought it meant something...

121
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,848
...because it was you.

122
00:07:57,122 --> 00:08:00,489
But it absolutely didn't.
lt didn't! lt didn't!

123
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:05,021
The band's ready
for your first dance with Emily.

124
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,960
Oh! The band's ready!

125
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:12,967
We've got to do what the band says.
l don't care about the stupid band!

126
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:16,569
You spit on me, man!

127
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:19,376
l'm sorry.

128
00:08:19,744 --> 00:08:22,645
Emily is taking kind of a long time.

129
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:25,042
When l locked myself up
at my wedding...

130
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,515
...l was trying to pop
the window out of the frame.

131
00:08:28,753 --> 00:08:31,722
Get the hell out of there.
You know?

132
00:08:39,664 --> 00:08:40,824
l'm coming in!

133
00:08:43,868 --> 00:08:46,234
Oh, look at that.
Same thing.

134
00:08:50,742 --> 00:08:55,202
ln the middle of everything,
if l scream, ''Yippee!'' just ignore me.

135
00:08:58,383 --> 00:09:01,352
-Oh, my God! Rachel!
-Oh, hello, Rachel.

136
00:09:02,353 --> 00:09:04,287
Ross said my name.

137
00:09:04,556 --> 00:09:06,023
Okay? My name!

138
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:08,086
Ross said my name up there.

139
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:10,761
That obviously means
he still loves me!

140
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:13,887
Don't believe me.
l know l'm right.

141
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:16,259
Do you guys want to go
and get a drink?

142
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:17,762
Yes, we do.

143
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:21,405
But we have to change first.

144
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,300
Yes, l want to change.

145
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:27,442
-Go get a table.
-We'll only be five minutes.

146
00:09:27,712 --> 00:09:29,236
Fifteen minutes.

147
00:09:34,986 --> 00:09:36,578
Oh, Pheebs! lt's Phoebe!

148
00:09:36,788 --> 00:09:38,813
-Oh, hey, hey.
-Oh, great.

149
00:09:39,924 --> 00:09:41,221
So, what happened?

150
00:09:41,426 --> 00:09:42,916
Well, Ross said my name.

151
00:09:43,661 --> 00:09:46,129
But l don't think
that means anything.

152
00:09:46,331 --> 00:09:48,424
Let's look at this objectively.

153
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,099
Ninth grade, right?

154
00:09:50,301 --> 00:09:51,768
The obsession starts.

155
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:57,068
Then he sees me in
a two-piece for the first time.

156
00:09:57,308 --> 00:09:59,572
His obsession begins to grow, right?

157
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:02,011
Why don't we go change in my room?

158
00:10:02,247 --> 00:10:03,646
My clothes are....

159
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:20,990
Wow, you look--

160
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:22,665
No time for that.

161
00:10:26,771 --> 00:10:30,263
Hey, dude! Let me in!
l got a girl out here!

162
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:33,034
l got a girl in here!

163
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:37,376
No, you don't.
l saw you go in with Monica.

164
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,341
Well, we're hanging out.

165
00:10:42,453 --> 00:10:46,389
Which one of us will be
having sex in there? Me or you?

166
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:49,858
l suppose l would
have to say you.

167
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:54,389
-What if we're watching a movie?
-Which we are!

168
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,190
And we've paid for it.

169
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:57,661
lt's <i>My Giant.</i>

170
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:59,994
<i>My Giant</i>?

171
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:02,298
l love that movie!

172
00:11:07,312 --> 00:11:08,574
Think this is okay?

173
00:11:08,846 --> 00:11:11,679
Well, Ross and Emily
aren't going to use it.

174
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,177
Oh, it's so beautiful!

175
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:17,983
l don't feel right about this.

176
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:22,856
This is the honeymoon suite.

177
00:11:23,061 --> 00:11:25,495
The room expects sex.

178
00:11:27,365 --> 00:11:30,892
The room would be disappointed
if it didn't get sex.

179
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:34,935
All the other honeymoon suites
would think it was a loser.

180
00:11:40,878 --> 00:11:43,108
Nope! Not under here!

181
00:11:46,084 --> 00:11:48,416
-You didn't find her?
-l've looked everywhere.

182
00:11:48,686 --> 00:11:51,280
You couldn't have,
or you would've found her.

183
00:11:51,522 --> 00:11:54,218
-Keep looking!
-Yeah! For about 30 minutes?

184
00:11:54,425 --> 00:11:55,858
Or 45?

185
00:11:58,596 --> 00:12:01,190
ln 45 minutes,
you could find her twice.

186
00:12:04,702 --> 00:12:09,765
For all l know, she's trying to find me
but couldn't, because l kept moving.

187
00:12:10,074 --> 00:12:12,702
From now on,
l'm staying in one place.

188
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:14,377
Right here.

189
00:12:18,216 --> 00:12:20,616
-lt's getting late.
-We're going to go.

190
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:24,715
Do you guys mind staying here
for a while?

191
00:12:26,057 --> 00:12:28,617
We've got to get up early
and catch that plane.

192
00:12:28,826 --> 00:12:30,817
Yeah, it's a very large plane.

193
00:12:33,398 --> 00:12:34,831
That's cool.

194
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:39,959
But we'll stay here with you.

195
00:12:40,305 --> 00:12:41,772
Thanks, guys!

196
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:48,136
l really appreciate this,
but you don't need to rub my butt.

197
00:13:02,994 --> 00:13:05,019
We have to leave in an hour.

198
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:07,924
l know. l've been looking
at those doors.

199
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:11,101
They look pretty soundproof,
don't you think?

200
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:13,800
We can't do that.
That's insane.

201
00:13:14,105 --> 00:13:17,541
l mean, A, he could wake up.
And B, you know...

202
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:19,174
...let's go for it.

203
00:13:29,454 --> 00:13:30,887
Nope.

204
00:13:32,223 --> 00:13:34,885
-She's not with us.
-We've come for her things.

205
00:13:35,126 --> 00:13:37,185
Where is she?

206
00:13:37,462 --> 00:13:41,728
She's in hiding. She's humiliated.
She doesn't want to see you again.

207
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:47,060
We're very sad that it didn't work out
between you and Emily, monkey.

208
00:13:48,706 --> 00:13:52,369
But l think you're
absolutely delicious!

209
00:13:53,044 --> 00:13:57,071
Excuse me,
l'm standing right here.

210
00:13:58,483 --> 00:13:59,677
Oh, yes.

211
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:02,044
There you are.

212
00:14:04,322 --> 00:14:07,883
Hurry up! Get some!
There's a whole cart outside.

213
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:09,150
Goodbye, Geller.

214
00:14:09,427 --> 00:14:11,327
Now, hold on. Hold on.

215
00:14:11,562 --> 00:14:16,499
Your daughter and l are supposed
to leave tonight for our honeymoon.

216
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:20,965
Tell her l'll be at that airport,
and l hope she will too.

217
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:24,532
l said Rachel's name,
but it didn't mean anything.

218
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:26,003
She's just a friend.

219
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:28,040
Tell Emily l love her and...

220
00:14:28,312 --> 00:14:31,577
...l can't imagine spending my life
with anyone else.

221
00:14:31,816 --> 00:14:35,252
Please, promise me that
you'll tell her that.

222
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:38,278
All right, l'll tell her.

223
00:14:38,956 --> 00:14:40,821
Come on, bugger face!

224
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:42,653
Call me.

225
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:48,892
You spend your life in the bathroom.
Why do you never go out the window?

226
00:15:06,184 --> 00:15:09,312
Maybe it's best we never
got to do it again.

227
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,648
Yeah, it kind of makes
that one night special.

228
00:15:16,494 --> 00:15:20,089
Technically, we still are
over international waters.

229
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:25,163
l'm going to the bathroom.
Maybe l'll see you there?

230
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:34,144
Can l ask you something?

231
00:15:37,782 --> 00:15:41,843
Felicity and l watched
<i>My Giant.</i> And l thought:

232
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:45,318
''l'll never be as good an actor
as that giant.''

233
00:15:45,556 --> 00:15:49,185
Do you think l'm wasting my life
with this acting thing?

234
00:15:50,962 --> 00:15:52,953
The giant's five years
younger than me.

235
00:15:53,197 --> 00:15:55,062
You think l'll ever get there?

236
00:16:00,238 --> 00:16:02,638
-Thanks, man.
-Okay, man.

237
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:05,842
But what about how much
taller he is than me?

238
00:16:06,744 --> 00:16:10,737
l mean, there's no way
l can make myself taller now.

239
00:16:10,982 --> 00:16:14,713
Who knows what science will
come up with in the future...

240
00:16:14,986 --> 00:16:18,683
...but what if l die an unsuccessful,
regular-size man?

241
00:16:20,725 --> 00:16:23,717
You've been in the
bathroom for a half-hour.

242
00:16:24,595 --> 00:16:25,584
l know!

243
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:28,392
Had the beef tips, huh?

244
00:16:46,284 --> 00:16:47,842
You ate meat!

245
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:51,179
You had sex!

246
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:54,580
No, we didn't.

247
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:57,956
l know you didn't.
l was talking about Monica.

248
00:16:59,397 --> 00:17:00,864
l did not have sex.

249
00:17:01,065 --> 00:17:06,128
This pregnancy is throwing me all off
and making me fat.

250
00:17:06,304 --> 00:17:09,034
-l'll say hi to the chick and duck.
-Me too!

251
00:17:09,273 --> 00:17:11,935
Why would you need to?
You've been feeding them.

252
00:17:12,443 --> 00:17:15,173
Oh, right.
Maybe l'll just go home.

253
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:27,356
We certainly are alone.

254
00:17:27,592 --> 00:17:30,425
Good thing we have that
''not New York'' rule.

255
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,690
Listen, since we're on that subject...

256
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:38,595
...l just wanted to tell you that....

257
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:41,861
l was going through
a hard time in London...

258
00:17:42,106 --> 00:17:47,271
...with my brother getting married and
that guy thinking l was Ross' mother.

259
00:17:48,546 --> 00:17:50,605
Well, anyway, l just....

260
00:17:50,815 --> 00:17:54,307
That night meant a lot to me.
And l'm trying to say thanks.

261
00:17:58,623 --> 00:18:01,114
You know, that night
meant a lot to me too.

262
00:18:01,392 --> 00:18:04,555
lt wasn't because l was
in a bad place or anything.

263
00:18:04,795 --> 00:18:07,958
lt just meant a lot because
you're really hot.

264
00:18:12,403 --> 00:18:13,427
ls that okay?

265
00:18:13,638 --> 00:18:14,969
That's okay.

266
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:16,996
And l'm cute too?

267
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,770
And you're cute too!

268
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:22,070
Thank you.

269
00:18:22,813 --> 00:18:24,974
All right, l gotta go unpack.

270
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,600
l'm still on London time.
Does that count?

271
00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:49,162
-Oh, that counts!
-Oh, good!

272
00:19:01,285 --> 00:19:02,718
What are you doing here?

273
00:19:02,987 --> 00:19:06,320
l've been on standby for
a flight home for hours.

274
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:09,357
So no sign of Emily?

275
00:19:09,894 --> 00:19:11,054
Not yet.

276
00:19:16,634 --> 00:19:18,192
When do you have to leave?

277
00:19:18,402 --> 00:19:22,270
<i>This is the last call</i>
<i>for flight 1 O66 to Athens.</i>

278
00:19:22,473 --> 00:19:23,997
<i>The last call.</i>

279
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,971
Pretty soon, l guess.

280
00:19:28,646 --> 00:19:30,045
l'm sorry.

281
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:32,640
l don't understand.

282
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,750
How could she do this?

283
00:19:34,985 --> 00:19:39,354
Am l a complete idiot for
thinking she'd actually show up?

284
00:19:40,991 --> 00:19:45,155
You're not an idiot, Ross.
You're a guy very much in love.

285
00:19:46,197 --> 00:19:47,528
Same difference.

286
00:19:47,732 --> 00:19:52,829
<i>All passengers for flight 1 O66</i>
<i>to Athens should now be onboard.</i>

287
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,503
l get it!

288
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:00,499
Well, that's that.

289
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:03,069
No, you know what?

290
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,577
l think you should go.

291
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,942
l think you should go...

292
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:10,551
...by yourself.
Get some distance.

293
00:20:10,788 --> 00:20:13,450
Clear your head.
lt would be really good.

294
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:15,386
l don't know.

295
00:20:15,593 --> 00:20:18,289
Come on.
lt would be really good for you.

296
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:22,858
l could do that.

297
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:27,029
l can't even believe her.

298
00:20:27,238 --> 00:20:29,138
You know what?
l am going to go.

299
00:20:29,406 --> 00:20:30,532
-Good.
-Why not?

300
00:20:30,741 --> 00:20:31,765
-Right?
-Right.

301
00:20:32,276 --> 00:20:33,265
Thanks.

302
00:20:33,477 --> 00:20:34,944
l'll see you back at home.

303
00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:37,305
lf l ever get a flight out of here.

304
00:20:40,217 --> 00:20:42,549
What? Wait, what?

305
00:20:44,255 --> 00:20:45,586
Why don't you come?

306
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,884
l mean, l have two tickets.
Why not?

307
00:20:50,127 --> 00:20:53,790
Well, l don't know, Ross.
Really?

308
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,427
Yeah. lt'd be great.
l mean, you can....

309
00:20:57,668 --> 00:20:59,499
You can lay on the beach...

310
00:20:59,737 --> 00:21:03,070
...and l can cry over
my failed marriage.

311
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,467
You see how l make jokes?

312
00:21:06,277 --> 00:21:07,574
Really. l mean....

313
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:09,969
l could use a friend.

314
00:21:10,281 --> 00:21:13,739
Oh, wow. Maybe.

315
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,514
Yes, l can do that!

316
00:21:18,322 --> 00:21:20,449
-Cool.
-All right, cool.

317
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:24,587
Okay, we're going to Greece.

318
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:26,694
l forgot my jacket!

319
00:21:26,931 --> 00:21:29,161
Well, you tell them to wait.

320
00:21:29,466 --> 00:21:30,865
Wait! Wait!

321
00:21:52,122 --> 00:21:54,647
l'll have a glass of Merlot...

322
00:21:54,925 --> 00:21:57,621
...and he'll have
a wine spritzer.

323
00:22:04,935 --> 00:22:07,335
Look!
The airport's moving.

324
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:09,198

Are we?
Why are we moving?

326
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,138
Does the captain know
that we're moving?

Oh, my gosh!
