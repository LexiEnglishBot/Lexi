1
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:08,932
Hey, Eddie.

2
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:13,441
- What are you doing here?
- Watching you sleep.

3
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:16,378
Why?

4
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:19,377
It makes me feel peaceful.

5
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:20,415
Please.

6
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,514
I can't sleep now!

7
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:23,916
You want me to sing?

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,025
That's it. I want you
out of the apartment now!

9
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:32,196
What are you talking about?

10
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,863
Hannibal Lecter?

11
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:37,568
Better roommate than you.

12
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:41,904
I don't think you're being fair! One
night you see me and you get scared.

13
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,110
What about the other nights
when you don't see me?

14
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:48,046
Last night you went
and got some water...

15
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,612
...and I was nice enough
to hide behind the door.

16
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:54,211
I didn't realize that.

17
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:56,513
Get out now!

18
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,251
You really want me out?

19
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:00,424
Yes, please.

20
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,287
Then I want to hear you say
you want me out.

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,788
I want you out.

22
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,692
I want to hear it from your lips.

23
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:09,596
Where'd you hear it before?

24
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:12,896
All right. You know what?
Consider me gone.

25
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:17,909
I will go to my brother's basement. When
he find out, I will find another man's house.

26
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,409
I'll be out by the time
you get home from work tomorrow.

27
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,884
- Thank you.
- I heard that.

28
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:32,823
The One Where Eddie Won't Go

29
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,133
Well, look at you!

30
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,067
Finally got that
time machine working, huh?

31
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:24,707
You like it?

32
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,741
This guy was selling them
on 8th Avenue and I thought...

33
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,038
..."You know what I don't have?"

34
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,681
A mirror?

35
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,715
Fine, make fun.
I think it's jaunty.

36
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,523
For a guy who's recently lost his job,
you're in a good mood.

37
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,954
I'll be all right.
I'm not starting from square one.

38
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,790
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray
on Days of our Lives.

39
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,625
That's got to have some kind of cachet.

40
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,767
Cachet? Jaunty?

41
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,767
Chandler gave me
word-of-the-day toilet paper.

42
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,311
I'm gonna get some coffee.

43
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,442
Go on, you know you want to.

44
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,259
So? Did you read the book?

45
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,658
Oh, my God.
It was incredible!

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,161
Didn't it, like,
totally speak to you?

47
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,493
What book is this?

48
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:29,174
You have to read this book.
It's called Be Your Own Wind Keeper.

49
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,500
It's about how women need
to become more empowered.

50
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,335
But there's wind.

51
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,745
And the wind can make us goddesses.

52
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:42,648
Do you know who takes our wind?
Men. They just take it.

53
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,220
Men just take our wind?

54
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:50,386
All the time. Because they
are the lightning-bearers.

55
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,433
That sounds kind of cool.
It's like The Hobbit.

56
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,603
It is nothing like The Hobbit.

57
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,667
It's like reading about
every relationship I've ever had.

58
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,035
Except for Richard.

59
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,835
Richard would never steal your wind.

60
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,605
Because he's yummy.

61
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:11,775
But all the others.

62
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,216
And the part about how
they're always drinking...

63
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,318
...from our pool of inner power.

64
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,819
But God forbid we should take a sip.

65
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,450
Anybody want a cruller?

66
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,757
This is a typical
lightning-bearer thing.

67
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,162
It's like...

68
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:29,560
..."Hello. Who wants one of
my phallic-shaped man-cakes?"

69
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:49,278
Don't worry about it, already!
Things happen.

70
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:54,719
You're not mad at me
for getting fired and everything?

71
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:56,858
Look at me.

72
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,864
Look at me!

73
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,167
Do I have lipstick on my teeth?

74
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,567
Can we get back to me?

75
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:13,006
Look, honey. People get fired
left and right in this business.

76
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,043
I already got you an audition
for Another World.

77
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:17,742
All right!

78
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,343
"Cab Driver Number 2"?

79
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,217
You're welcome.

80
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,357
But I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

81
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:30,058
How can I go from being
a neurosurgeon to driving a cab?

82
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:40,766
Things change. Roll with them.

83
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,234
But this is a two-line part!

84
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,602
It's like taking a step backwards.

85
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,710
I'm not gonna do this.

86
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,919
I'm gonna tell you the same thing
I told Al Minza...

87
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,246
...and his pyramid of dogs.

88
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:01,024
Take any job you can get,
and don't make on the floor.

89
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,589
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,391
I'll see you.

91
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,059
God!

92
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,662
Oh, God!
I mean, it's just so...

93
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,098
Isn't it?

94
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,441
This is like reading
about my own life!

95
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,441
This book could have been called
Be Your Own Wind Keeper, Rachel!

96
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,279
It wouldn't have sold
a million copies...

97
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,644
...but it would've made
a nice gift for you.

98
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,481
Sweetie, we've got to go.

99
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:40,964
No! Why do we always have to do
everything according to your timetable?

100
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,431
Actually, it's the movie theater
that has the timetable.

101
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,365
It's so you don't miss the beginning.

102
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:53,577
This isn't about the movie theater.
This is about you stealing my wind.

103
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,182
You go, girl!

104
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,314
I can't pull that off, can I?

105
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,024
Excuse me, your wind?

106
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,783
Yes, my wind.

107
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,520
How do you expect me to grow
if you won't let me blow?

108
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,130
You know I don't...

109
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,904
...have a problem with that.

110
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:40,554
I just really need to be
with myself right now.

111
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:42,790
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,861
You're right.
I don't have to apologize.

113
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,390
Sorry. Damn it!

114
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,666
- What is it?
- I don't know.

115
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,606
It's got all this stuff
about wind and trees...

116
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,505
...and some sacred pool.

117
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,842
I don't really get it.
But she's pretty upset about it.

118
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,882
This is why I don't date
women who read.

119
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,188
What's that?

120
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,516
It's my VISA bill.

121
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,059
Envelope one of two.

122
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,929
- That can't be good.
- Open it, open it.

123
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,068
Oh, my God!

124
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:31,705
Look at this!
How did I spend so much money?

125
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,808
That's just the minimum amount.
That's your total.

126
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:41,385
Thirty-five hundred dollars
at "Porcelain Safari"?

127
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,019
My animals.

128
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:48,250
The guy said they suited me. He spoke
with an accent. I was confused.

129
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:50,859
I don't know what to do!

130
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,031
You can start by driving a cab
on Another World.

131
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,994
- What?
- That audition?

132
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,894
That's a two-line part!

133
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:02,240
Joey, you owe $1100
at "I Love Lucite."

134
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,802
- So what?
- So suck it up, man.

135
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,669
It's a job. It's money.

136
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:10,608
I don't need you getting judgmental
and condescending and pedantic.

137
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,114
Toilet paper?

138
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,985
I'm not being any of those things.
I'm being realistic.

139
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,055
You're supposed to be my friend!

140
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,123
I am your friend.

141
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,419
Then tell me things like,
"You'll be fine."

142
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,825
And "Something big's gonna
come along. I know it!"

143
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,364
But I don't know it.

144
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:33,127
What I do know is you owe $2300
at "Isn't It Chromantic?"

145
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,369
I'm aware of what I owe.

146
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:40,476
Then get some sense.
It took you 10 years to get that job.

147
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,511
- How long till you get another?
- I don't want to hear this!

148
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,773
I'm just saying...

149
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,110
Well, don't "just say"!

150
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:50,953
Maybe I should just go.

151
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,516
I'll see you later.

152
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,463
Just think about it.

153
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,562
I don't need to think about it!

154
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,027
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

155
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,065
That was huge!

156
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,804
Big things are gonna happen!
You'll see!

157
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,064
Ross!

158
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,142
You still there?

159
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:39,898
What are you still doing here?

160
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,002
Just some basic dehydrating
of fruits and vegetables.

161
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,800
Man alive, this thing's fantastic!

162
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,873
Aren't you forgetting anything?

163
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,340
Oh, yeah. I got us a new goldfish.

164
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,311
He's feistier than the last one.

165
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,654
Maybe because the last one
was made by Pepperidge Farm.

166
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,819
Eddie, isn't there something
you're supposed to be doing now?

167
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,494
Not unless it's got something
to do with dehydrating.

168
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,562
Because right now,
I'm a dehydrating maniac!

169
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,766
I thought we had a deal.
I thought by the time I got

170
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,165
You know what that is?

171
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,704
Your last roommate's kidney?

172
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,840
That's a tomato.

173
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,149
This one definitely goes
in the display.

174
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,893
Hey, Gunther.
Let me get a lemonade to go.

175
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,293
Lemonade?

176
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,196
You okay, man?

177
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,724
It's career stuff.

178
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,559
They killed off
my character on the show.

179
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,538
That's too bad.
How'd they do it?

180
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,967
I fell down an elevator shaft.

181
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:51,977
That sucks.

182
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:53,868
I was buried in an avalanche.

183
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,613
What?

184
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,249
I used to be Brice
on All My Children.

185
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,840
Why must everybody watch me sleep?

186
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,737
There'll be no more
watching me sleep! No more...

187
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:26,978
...watching!

188
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,090
I got some great stuff to dehydrate.
Grapes, apricots.

189
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:46,059
I thought it'd be cool to see
what happens with these water balloons.

190
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,333
Get out.
Get out, get out, get out!

191
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,662
- What?
- You! Move out!

192
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:56,931
Take your fruit!
Your stupid small fruit and get out!

193
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,109
You want me to move out?

194
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:11,986
I gotta tell you, that's kind of
out of the blue, don't you think?

195
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,959
This is not out of the blue!

196
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,353
This is smack-dab
in the middle of the blue!

197
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,867
Relax! Take it easy, buddy!

198
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,692
You don't have to tell me twice.

199
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,502
Someone will be by for my stuff.

200
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:35,981
If you think I'm leaving you
alone with my fish, you're insane!

201
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,215
You want some help?

202
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,349
No help required, chico!

203
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,332
All the way to the airport, huh?
You know, that's over 30 miles.

204
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,833
That's gonna cost you about so bucks.

205
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,335
Excuse me, that's fifty bucks.

206
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,438
Five-O dollars.

207
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:12,347
You know what it is?
It's smudgy because they're fax pages.

208
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,486
When I was on Days of our Lives
as Dr. Drake Ramoray...

209
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,649
...they'd send over
the whole script on real paper.

210
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,989
That's great.

211
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:26,254
If you wanted to expand this scene,
like have the cab crash...

212
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,397
...I could attend to the victims...

213
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,194
...because I have a background
in medical acting.

214
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,795
Okay, listen, thanks for coming in.

215
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,305
Don't thank me for coming in.
At least let me finish.

216
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,776
We could take the expressway...

217
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,247
...but this time of day
you're better off taking the budge.

218
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,652
You were going for bridge there,
weren't you?

219
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,622
I'll have a good day.

220
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,657
Honey, I know you didn't mean to.

221
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,662
Rach, hang up. You're supposed
to be taking goddess quiz.

222
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,676
You should lose 100 point just because of
you call your boyfriend in the middle of it.

223
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:18,944
Question number 28.

224
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:23,120
"Have you ever allowed a
lightning-bearer to take your wind?"

225
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,617
I would have to say no.

226
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,856
And I would have to say...

227
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:31,859
What?

228
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,858
Do you not remember the puppet guy?

229
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:39,070
You totally let him wash his feet
in the pool of your inner power.

230
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,334
And his puppet too!

231
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,734
Well, at least
I didn't let some guy...

232
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,877
...into the forest of my righteous
truth on the first date!

233
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,616
- Who?
- Paul!

234
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,519
Moving on, moving on.
Next question.

235
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,523
Okay, number 29.

236
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:03,693
"Have you ever betrayed
another goddess...

237
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,829
...for a lightning-bearer?"
Okay, number 30.

238
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,999
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Let's go back to 29.

239
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,970
Not to my recollection.

240
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,801
Danny Arshack, ninth grade.

241
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,479
You know the bottle
was pointing at me.

242
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,444
Only because you took up
half the circle!

243
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:32,290
Listen to you two.
It's so sad.

244
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,360
Looks like I'll be going to
the goddess meetings alone.

245
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,294
Not when they find out
you slept with Jason Hurley...

246
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,364
...an hour after
he broke up with Monica.

247
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,265
One hour?

248
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,699
You are such a leaf blower!

249
00:16:56,715 --> 00:17:00,651
- That is not on the book.
- No, but that's what you are.

250
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:17,658
Be careful with that 3-D Last Supper.
Judas is a little loose.

251
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,439
Oh, my God! What's going on?

252
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:28,912
They're taking all my stuff back.
I guess you were right.

253
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:32,208
No, I wasn't right.
That's what I came here to tell you.

254
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,843
I was totally hung up
on my own stuff the other day.

255
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:40,853
No, listen. I need the whole
security thing, you know?

256
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:45,358
To know where my next paycheck is
coming from. But you don't need that.

257
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,265
And that's amazing to me.

258
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,897
I could never do what you do.

259
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,530
- Thanks.
- You hold out for something bigger.

260
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,865
I can't tell you
how much respect I have...

261
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:58,769
...for you not going
to that stupid audition.

262
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,873
- I went.
- Great! How did it go?

263
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,308
- I didn't get it.
- Good for you!

264
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,775
You're living the dream!

265
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,347
All right, then!

266
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,589
Not my parrot.

267
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,551
I can't watch this.

268
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,252
Hey, hold on, hold on.

269
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,633
How much for the...
How much to save the bird?

270
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,634
- Twelve hundred.
- Dollars?

271
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,569
You spent $1200 on a plastic bird?

272
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,730
It was an impulse buy.
Near the register.

273
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,640
Go ahead with the bird.

274
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:36,174
Do you have anything for around $200?

275
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,977
The dog.

276
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,414
I'll take it.

277
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,317
My gift to you, man.

278
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:49,986
Thanks, Ross!

279
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,286
I really liked that bird, though.

280
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,590
But the dog!

281
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,371
Here are your cakes.

282
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:06,939
We didn't order cake.

283
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,207
No, I know. They're from me.

284
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,742
You guys, this is not good.

285
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,486
We have enough trouble
with guys stealing our wind...

286
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,745
...without taking it from each other.

287
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:19,785
You're right.

288
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,249
I love you goddesses.

289
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,758
I don't ever want
to suck your wind again.

290
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,066
- Thank you. So are we good?
- We're good.

291
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,997
We're good?

292
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,070
Let me take these back.
They'll take it out of my paycheck.

293
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,346
Ding-dong, the psycho's gone!

294
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,508
Are you sure this time?

295
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,684
I actually saw him leave.

296
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,320
That guy is holding a human head.

297
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,121
He's holding a human head!

298
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:58,696
Check it out, man!

299
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,933
I tore it off a mannequin
in the alley behind Macy's.

300
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,223
There's no alley behind Macy's.

301
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,231
So I got it in the junior miss
department. Big diff.

302
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:10,099
It'll make a hell of a conversation
piece at our next cocktail party.

303
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,672
"Our next cocktail party"?

304
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,676
We'll put chips in it.
We'll make it a chip chick.

305
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,977
Do you remember yesterday?

306
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,312
Yes, I think I vaguely recall it.

307
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,521
Do you remember
talking to me yesterday?

308
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,295
So what happened?

309
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,471
We took a road trip to Las Vegas!

310
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,605
Oh, sweet Moses!

311
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,769
So on this road trip,
did you win any money?

312
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:52,208
I crapped out. But Mr. 21 here!
He cleans up!

313
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,714
$300! He buys me these new shoes.

314
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,378
Nice.

315
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,679
See you upstairs. See you, pals!

316
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,788
Is anyone else starting
to really like him?

317
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,447
May I help you?

318
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,949
Why doesn't my key work,
and what's my stuff doing downstairs?

319
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,046
I'm sorry.

320
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:35,921
Have we met?

321
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,458
It's Eddie, you freak!
Your roommate.

322
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:40,998
I'm sorry...

323
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,027
...I already have a roommate.

324
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:55,646
He's lived here for years.
I don't know what you're talking about.

325
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:01,841
No, he moved out and I moved in.

326
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:06,620
Well, I think we'd remember
something like that.

327
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,516
I know I would.

328
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,029
That's a good point.

329
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,653
Okay, wow.

330
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,162
I guess I got the wrong apartment.

331
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,634
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Hey, no problem.

332
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,032
See you.

333
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,849
Goodbye, you fruit-drying psychopath.

334
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,547
- You want me to help you unpack?
- Nah, I'm okay.

335
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:42,118
Just so you know, I'm not
moving back in because I have to.

336
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:45,055
I mean, I do have to, but...

337
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:48,491
It's just that that place,
it wasn't really...

338
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,496
I mean, this is...

339
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,370
Welcome home, man.

340
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,314
- A little foos?
- Absolutely!

341
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,682
What happened to the foosball?

342
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:11,820
It's a cantaloupe.

343
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,692
Are we gonna bring this out
every time Ross comes over?

344
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:22,125
He paid a lot of money for it.

345
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,467
I'm gonna hold him a different way.

346
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:35,369
If you hated it so much,
why'd you buy it in the first place?
