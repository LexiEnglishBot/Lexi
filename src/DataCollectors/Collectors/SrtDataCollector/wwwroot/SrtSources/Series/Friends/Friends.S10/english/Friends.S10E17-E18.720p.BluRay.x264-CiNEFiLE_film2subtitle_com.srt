1
00:00:02,157 --> 00:00:03,783
Previously on Friends:

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,619
- Erica, are you okay?
- Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much.

3
00:00:06,786 --> 00:00:11,499
I keep getting these stomachaches.
They come and go, like, every few minutes.

4
00:00:13,126 --> 00:00:17,547
- Oh, my God.
- Relax, we'll just get her some antacids.

5
00:00:18,214 --> 00:00:20,675
She doesn't have a stomachache!
She's in labor!

6
00:00:20,842 --> 00:00:21,885
Oh, my God!

7
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:24,012
If you think that I didn't say goodbye...

8
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:27,599
...because you don't mean as much
to me as everybody else, you're wrong.

9
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:29,559
It's because you mean more to me.

10
00:00:30,018 --> 00:00:31,644
- Rash!
- What?

11
00:00:55,126 --> 00:00:57,253
- Hey.
- Ha, ha.

12
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,673
Shh. Go back to sleep.
I have to go home.

13
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,469
Oh, God. This was amazing.

14
00:01:05,345 --> 00:01:07,430
It really was.

15
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:10,517
You've learned some new moves.

16
00:01:11,392 --> 00:01:15,897
Yeah, well, uh, this guy at work gave me
Sex for Dummies as a joke.

17
00:01:16,064 --> 00:01:17,565
- Ah.
- Who's laughing now?

18
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:19,067
I am.

19
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,288
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

20
00:02:14,664 --> 00:02:16,666
Okay. Good.

21
00:02:16,874 --> 00:02:18,376
Next time, can I say "breathe"?

22
00:02:18,543 --> 00:02:21,588
No. Last time, you said it like Dracula,
and it scared her.

23
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:25,341
Can I get you anything?
Want more ice chips?

24
00:02:25,508 --> 00:02:28,511
- No, I'm okay.
- All right. I'll be right back.

25
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:33,182
- Where you going?
- To use the bathroom.

26
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:36,769
- You can't leave me alone with her.
- What?

27
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:39,814
This is exactly
the kind of social situation...

28
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:41,816
...that I am not comfortable with.

29
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,154
What kind of social situation
are you comfortable with?

30
00:02:46,988 --> 00:02:50,617
It's just that we've never spent any time,
you know, alone together.

31
00:02:50,783 --> 00:02:54,787
You'll be fine. You won't,
but I'll be back in two minutes.

32
00:02:54,954 --> 00:02:56,122
Okay.

33
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,675
So, uh, any plans for the summer?

34
00:03:09,427 --> 00:03:11,804
I don't know. Maybe church camp.

35
00:03:14,724 --> 00:03:16,434
Ha...

36
00:03:16,684 --> 00:03:19,187
May not want to mention this.

37
00:03:22,065 --> 00:03:24,359
So you ever wonder which is worse?

38
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:28,655
You know, going through labor
or getting kicked in the nuts?

39
00:03:29,781 --> 00:03:32,867
- What?
- Oh, it's just interesting.

40
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:37,747
You know, because no one will ever know
because no one can experience both.

41
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,879
One of life's great
unanswerable questions.

42
00:03:46,756 --> 00:03:47,882
I mean, who knows?

43
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:50,551
Maybe there's something
even more painful than those things.

44
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:56,140
Like this.

45
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,815
- Come in.
- Morning.

46
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:05,733
- Hey.
- What's that?

47
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,404
Oh, it's my housewarming present
for Monica and Chandler.

48
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:12,824
- That's a baby chick and duck.
- Uh-huh.

49
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,910
And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.

50
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:19,163
- I did not see that coming.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

51
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,250
They'll love it at that new house.
It has that big backyard.

52
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:24,585
And when they're old,
they can go to that farm...

53
00:04:24,752 --> 00:04:27,630
...that Chandler took
the other chick and duck to.

54
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:30,425
- Yes.
- Yeah.

55
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,762
- It's a shame people can't visit there.
- That is the rule though.

56
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:41,185
- Guess what. You're almost an uncle.
- What?

57
00:04:41,352 --> 00:04:44,856
Erica went into labor. Monica and
Chandler are at the hospital right now.

58
00:04:45,022 --> 00:04:47,942
- Oh, my God!
- I have a feeling it's gonna be a girl.

59
00:04:48,109 --> 00:04:50,778
Phoebe, you were sure Ben
was gonna be a girl.

60
00:04:50,945 --> 00:04:53,156
Have you seen him throw a ball'?

61
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:58,619
- Is Rachel here?
- Uh, I think she's still asleep.

62
00:04:58,786 --> 00:05:01,038
Hey, hey, hey. How did it go
with you guys last night?

63
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:03,374
She seemed pretty pissed at you.

64
00:05:03,624 --> 00:05:06,627
We, uh...
You know, we worked things out.

65
00:05:07,795 --> 00:05:10,631
What's that smile?
Did something happen with you two?

66
00:05:10,798 --> 00:05:13,301
Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell.

67
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:17,305
Uh, but I'm also not one to have sex
and shut up. We totally did it.

68
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:20,391
Oh, my God. You and Rachel?

69
00:05:20,558 --> 00:05:23,478
- I know, it's pretty great.
- So, what does that mean?

70
00:05:23,644 --> 00:05:26,314
- Are you guys getting back together?
- Oh, I don't know.

71
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:29,817
- We didn't really get to talk.
- But do you want to get back together?

72
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:32,028
I don't know.

73
00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:35,823
It was incredible.
I mean, it just felt so right.

74
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:41,120
When I was holding her,
I mean, I never wanted to let her go.

75
00:05:42,163 --> 00:05:44,207
Know what? Yeah, I do.
I want to be together.

76
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:45,666
Yay!
- Shh!

77
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:47,418
Yay!

78
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,713
So is she still going to Paris?

79
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,800
Wow, I hadn't thought of that.
I hope not.

80
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:57,720
This is, like, the best day ever. Ever.
You guys might get back together.

81
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,015
Monica and Chandler get their baby.
There are chicks and ducks...

82
00:06:01,182 --> 00:06:03,017
...in the world again.

83
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:06,312
Oh. I feel like I'm in a musical.

84
00:06:08,356 --> 00:06:11,818
When the sun comes up
Bright and beamin'

85
00:06:11,984 --> 00:06:13,027
And the moon comes

86
00:06:13,194 --> 00:06:15,905
- Morning.
- Guess you'll never know how it ends.

87
00:06:17,365 --> 00:06:18,866
- Hey.
- Hi.

88
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:22,119
- Hi. How'd you sleep?
- Good. You?

89
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,748
- Good.
- I'll bet you did.

90
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,502
Uh, would you guys mind
giving us a minute?

91
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:31,963
Sure. Yeah. Just keep an eye
on the chick and duck.

92
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:34,131
Chick and the duck'? Didn't they die...?

93
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:40,555
Dive. Yeah, they dove.
Headfirst into fun on the farm.

94
00:06:47,562 --> 00:06:48,938
O

95
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:54,986
- Morning.
- You too.

96
00:06:55,152 --> 00:06:58,990
- Last night was just wonderful.
- Oh, it really was.

97
00:06:59,156 --> 00:07:01,325
I woke up today
with the biggest smile on my face.

98
00:07:01,492 --> 00:07:03,578
I know, me too. It was...

99
00:07:03,744 --> 00:07:07,498
You know, it was like one of those things
you think is never gonna happen.

100
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:11,419
And then it does,
and it's everything you want it to be.

101
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,171
I know. It was just...

102
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:18,801
It's just the perfect way to say goodbye.

103
00:07:27,143 --> 00:07:30,146
- Just a little bit more, honey.
- Oh, man, this hurts!

104
00:07:30,313 --> 00:07:32,148
- Is it really that bad?
- Uh-huh.

105
00:07:32,315 --> 00:07:36,277
I think it's time to kick you in the nuts
and see which is worse.

106
00:07:38,362 --> 00:07:40,781
The baby's head is crowning.

107
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:45,536
Oh, my God! That is the most beautiful
top of a head I have ever seen.

108
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:50,082
- Chandler, you have to see this.
- I'm okay.

109
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:53,210
You don't want to miss this.
This is the birth of your child.

110
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:56,923
- It's the miracle of life.
- All right.

111
00:07:58,674 --> 00:08:02,303
Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.

112
00:08:02,803 --> 00:08:05,139
Start pushing. Here we go.

113
00:08:05,306 --> 00:08:07,350
Here come the shoulders.

114
00:08:13,814 --> 00:08:16,233
It's a boy.

115
00:08:16,484 --> 00:08:19,153
- Is he okay?
- He's just fine.

116
00:08:19,362 --> 00:08:21,155
You did it.

117
00:08:21,322 --> 00:08:22,949
It's a baby.

118
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:28,913
A beautiful little baby. And some other
stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.

119
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:34,126
- Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?
- Okay.

120
00:08:37,838 --> 00:08:39,799
Well, that's spongy.

121
00:08:41,384 --> 00:08:43,260
Oh...

122
00:08:44,345 --> 00:08:46,222
Hey, handsome.

123
00:08:47,056 --> 00:08:52,269
I'll love you so much that no woman
is ever gonna be good enough for you.

124
00:08:54,355 --> 00:08:57,066
- We are so lucky.
- I know.

125
00:08:58,025 --> 00:09:00,403
He has your eyes.

126
00:09:01,946 --> 00:09:05,449
I mean, I know that's not possible,
but he does.

127
00:09:05,616 --> 00:09:08,536
- We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
- Okay.

128
00:09:10,371 --> 00:09:12,790
Oh, my God, he's beautiful.

129
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,044
- Thank you so much.
- I'm really happy for you guys.

130
00:09:17,503 --> 00:09:20,631
- How do you feel?
- I'm tired.

131
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:25,594
You don't have that much time to relax.
The other one will be along in a minute.

132
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:34,020
I'm sorry, who should be along
in a what, now?

133
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:38,315
The next baby should be
along in a minute.

134
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:41,235
We only ordered one.

135
00:09:42,153 --> 00:09:45,281
- You know it's twins, right?
- Oh, yeah.

136
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:48,909
These are the faces
of two people in the know.

137
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:58,461
I can't believe you didn't know its twins.
This has never happened before.

138
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:02,423
Well, gosh. That makes me
feel so special and good.

139
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,091
Did you know it was twins?

140
00:10:04,258 --> 00:10:06,802
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork
we got from the clinic.

141
00:10:07,219 --> 00:10:10,097
- Did anybody tell you?
- I don't think so.

142
00:10:10,264 --> 00:10:13,309
Although, they did mention something
about two heartbeats...

143
00:10:13,476 --> 00:10:15,519
...but I thought that was just mine
and the baby's.

144
00:10:15,686 --> 00:10:17,354
They said, "Both heartbeats are strong."

145
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:20,941
And I thought, "Well, that's good,
because I'm having a baby."

146
00:10:22,234 --> 00:10:25,321
- This is unbelievable.
- Twins actually run in my family.

147
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,239
Interesting.

148
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:30,659
Can I see you for a second?

149
00:10:32,912 --> 00:10:35,331
- What do we do?
- What do you mean, "What do we do?"

150
00:10:35,498 --> 00:10:39,168
Twins!

151
00:10:39,543 --> 00:10:43,631
- Chandler, you're panicking.
- Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?

152
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,969
What do you say we keep one and then
just have an option on the other one?

153
00:10:49,136 --> 00:10:51,764
- We can't split them up.
- Why not?

154
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:54,100
We could give each of them
half a medallion.

155
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:56,894
And then years later,
they'll find each other...

156
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:03,901
...and be reunited. I mean,
that's a great day for everybody.

157
00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:07,154
Okay. What if the person who adopts
the other one is horrible?

158
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:10,324
What if they're not?
What if it's adopted by a king?

159
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:13,869
Yeah. Because I hear the king
is looking to adopt.

160
00:11:14,036 --> 00:11:17,081
Monica, we are not ready
to have two babies.

161
00:11:17,248 --> 00:11:20,668
That doesn't matter.
We have waited so long for this.

162
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:24,046
I don't care if it's two babies.
I don't care if it's three babies.

163
00:11:24,213 --> 00:11:27,925
I don't care if the entire cast
of Eight Is Enough comes out of there.

164
00:11:29,802 --> 00:11:32,972
We are taking them home
because they are our children.

165
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,267
Okay. Shh.

166
00:11:37,101 --> 00:11:38,352
- Okay!
- Okay!

167
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,396
Okay.

168
00:11:40,938 --> 00:11:43,691
It looks like we're about ready
over here. Come on, Erica.

169
00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:45,943
Start pushing again now.

170
00:11:47,403 --> 00:11:51,031
- Here she comes.
- She? It's a girl?

171
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,825
Yeah.

172
00:11:54,368 --> 00:11:56,245
Well, now we have one of each.

173
00:11:57,746 --> 00:12:00,499
And that's enough.

174
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:06,672
And then she said it was the perfect way
to say goodbye.

175
00:12:07,047 --> 00:12:08,757
Oh, my God.

176
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:10,384
What did you say?

177
00:12:10,551 --> 00:12:15,097
- Nothing. What do you say to that?
- Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel.

178
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:17,725
- No way.
- Well, you can't just give up.

179
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:20,186
Is that what a dinosaur would do?

180
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:24,190
- What?
- I'm just trying to speak your language.

181
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:28,819
Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you
even wanna get back together.

182
00:12:28,986 --> 00:12:33,073
If she did, she might feel differently.
She might not even go.

183
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,659
- You really think so?
- I'm telling you!

184
00:12:35,826 --> 00:12:40,456
Oh, okay, this is the part of the musical
where there'd be a good, convincing song.

185
00:12:40,623 --> 00:12:43,500
Don't take no for an answer

186
00:12:45,252 --> 00:12:47,504
Don't let love fly away

187
00:12:47,755 --> 00:12:51,300
- Hi.
- Can't a girl finish a song around here?

188
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:54,261
- Hey.
- Hi. So I dropped Emma off at my mom's.

189
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:56,347
- Okay.
- You're not taking her tonight?

190
00:12:56,555 --> 00:12:59,058
No, we decided that
I'd go ahead and set up first...

191
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:01,310
...then my mom would bring Emma
to Paris on Sunday.

192
00:13:01,518 --> 00:13:03,812
Wow. Eight-hour flight with a baby.
Good luck, Mom.

193
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:07,858
Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mom
talking about Atkins. Good luck, Emma.

194
00:13:10,653 --> 00:13:14,823
All right. You know what? You're right.
I should at least tell her how I feel.

195
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,201
- Ross. Wait, wait.
- What? What?

196
00:13:17,368 --> 00:13:19,036
Could you get me a muffin?

197
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:25,000
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

198
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:31,757
I know you're leaving tonight,
but I just have to tell you.

199
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:33,634
I love you.

200
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:39,765
Now, I don't know if that changes
your plans at all.

201
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:44,395
But I thought you should know.

202
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:47,690
Gunther.

203
00:13:49,608 --> 00:13:54,280
I love you too.
Probably not in the same way.

204
00:13:54,446 --> 00:13:59,702
But I do. And when I'm
in a café having coffee...

205
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:03,372
...or I see a man with hair
brighter than the sun...

206
00:14:04,707 --> 00:14:06,875
...I'll think of you.

207
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,718
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye.

208
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:20,723
Oh, my God!

209
00:14:21,598 --> 00:14:23,934
Unbelievable.

210
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:26,979
- Hey, you know what might help?
- I'm not getting you a muffin!

211
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,701
Do you think they recognize
each other from in there?

212
00:14:40,868 --> 00:14:43,912
Maybe. Unless they're like people
who've lived in apartments...

213
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,916
...next to each other for years, then one
day they're pushed through a vagina...

214
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,877
...and they meet.

215
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:53,005
We're going to take Erica
to Recovery now.

216
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:55,341
There's something
that we wanted to tell you.

217
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,846
We decided to name the girl baby Erica.

218
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,308
Oh, my God, that's just like my name!

219
00:15:06,393 --> 00:15:08,645
Son of a gun, it is.

220
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:13,233
Anyway, I'm gonna go get some rest.

221
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:19,073
I'm really glad I picked you guys.
You're gonna make great parents.

222
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:21,283
Even Chandler.

223
00:15:23,827 --> 00:15:25,329
- Okay, well, bye.
- Bye.

224
00:15:25,496 --> 00:15:26,914
- We'll call you.
- Okay.

225
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:29,541
Have fun at church camp.

226
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:39,051
- Look at these little bunnies.
- I know.

227
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,428
You ready to trade?

228
00:15:41,637 --> 00:15:44,390
_Qkay-
_Qkay-

229
00:15:44,598 --> 00:15:46,600
Okay. Let's see.

230
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:58,153
- We could trade later.
- Yeah, I'm good.

231
00:16:01,573 --> 00:16:05,828
- Hey, what are you working on?
- A "welcome home" sign for the baby.

232
00:16:05,994 --> 00:16:08,831
How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?

233
00:16:09,873 --> 00:16:12,084
No, I sat in the paint.

234
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:16,130
- Hey.
- So did you talk to Rachel?

235
00:16:16,338 --> 00:16:19,341
- No. And I'm not going to.
- What?

236
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:21,885
- Why not?
- She's just gonna shoot me down.

237
00:16:22,052 --> 00:16:25,097
You saw what happened with Gunther.
That did not look like fun.

238
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:27,641
How can you compare
yourself to Gunther?

239
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:30,436
I mean, sure, he's sexy
in a more obvious way.

240
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:36,442
You have a relationship with her.
You slept together last night.

241
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:40,487
Yeah, and she still wants to go.
It's pretty clear where she is.

242
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:42,865
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I mean, sometimes...

243
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:45,868
- Uh, Joe.
- Damn it!

244
00:16:46,076 --> 00:16:48,704
If I were gonna tell her,
I don't have to do it now.

245
00:16:48,871 --> 00:16:51,248
Okay? I'll be seeing her again.
We've got time.

246
00:16:51,415 --> 00:16:55,669
No, you don't. She's going to Paris!
She is going to meet somebody.

247
00:16:55,836 --> 00:17:01,341
Do you know how many hot guys there
are in Paris? It's a city of Gunthers.

248
00:17:04,178 --> 00:17:05,804
- Hey.
- Hey.

249
00:17:05,971 --> 00:17:08,474
- What do you have there?
- Oh, I made a little something.

250
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,393
If I had more time to work on it,
it'd be better, but...

251
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:17,566
- Oh, my God, you did that yourself?
- Honey, that's gorgeous.

252
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:21,153
You know, the baby can't read, Mike.

253
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:26,158
Hi. The car service just got here.
I can't believe they're not home yet!

254
00:17:26,366 --> 00:17:28,994
I have to catch my stupid plane.
I want to see the baby.

255
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:32,706
Monica just called from the cab.
She said they should be here any minute.

256
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:36,543
- Apparently, there's some big surprise.
- Yeah, did she sound happy about it?

257
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,964
Because my friend Ethel's baby
was born with a teeny-tiny beard.

258
00:17:45,552 --> 00:17:49,556
- Welcome home.
- Oh, my God.

259
00:17:50,682 --> 00:17:53,435
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hey.

260
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:55,103
Hey.

261
00:17:58,065 --> 00:18:00,901
Hey, so, what is the big surprise?

262
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:07,783
- Oh, my God!
- How did this...?

263
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,953
Okay, awkward question.
The hospital knows you took two, right?

264
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:15,082
- Yes. It's twins.
- Oh, my... They are so cute.

265
00:18:15,249 --> 00:18:20,754
- Now, what kinds are they?
- This is a boy. And that's a girl.

266
00:18:20,921 --> 00:18:22,464
Her name is Erica.

267
00:18:23,465 --> 00:18:26,301
Hey, that pregnant girl's name
was Erica.

268
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:30,639
Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't
get to spend more time together.

269
00:18:31,598 --> 00:18:33,976
Yeah, and we named the boy Jack,
after Dad.

270
00:18:34,142 --> 00:18:38,480
- He's gonna be so happy.
- Jack Bing. I love that.

271
00:18:38,689 --> 00:18:42,776
It sounds like a '40s newspaper guy.
You know, "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette.

272
00:18:42,943 --> 00:18:46,113
I'm gonna blow this story wide open."

273
00:18:49,616 --> 00:18:52,160
Oh, my gosh.

274
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:55,289
- So beautiful.
- I want one.

275
00:18:55,455 --> 00:19:00,210
Oh, yeah? Well, tell me which one.
I'll try to slip it in my coat.

276
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,006
Seriously. I mean,
you want to make one of those?

277
00:19:04,172 --> 00:19:06,466
- One? How about a whole bunch?
- Really?

278
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:11,847
Yeah. We can teach them to sing,
and we could be like the von Trapp family.

279
00:19:12,014 --> 00:19:15,142
Only without the Nazis.
Although that sounds kind of dull.

280
00:19:16,518 --> 00:19:20,230
I can't believe this. If I don't leave now,
I'm gonna miss my plane.

281
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,359
- I'm so glad you got to see the babies.
- Me too.

282
00:19:24,526 --> 00:19:29,114
I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around
to watch you two attempt to handle this.

283
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:34,620
All right. Oh, I can't say goodbye
to you guys again.

284
00:19:34,786 --> 00:19:37,581
- I love you all so much.
- Love you.

285
00:19:37,748 --> 00:19:39,374
- We love you.
- Call us when you get there.

286
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:43,128
I will. Ross, come here.

287
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:47,841
I just want you to know...

288
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:51,511
...last night...

289
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:55,182
...I'll never forget it.

290
00:19:55,932 --> 00:19:57,893
Neither will I.

291
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:08,153
All right. Now I really have to go.

292
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,822
Okay, au revoir.

293
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:12,407
Ugh.

294
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:15,661
They're gonna really hate me over there.

295
00:20:17,996 --> 00:20:20,624
So you just let her go?

296
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,793
Yeah.

297
00:20:23,752 --> 00:20:26,588
- Hey, maybe that's for the best.
- Yeah?

298
00:20:26,797 --> 00:20:29,883
Yeah. You know, you just...
Look, you gotta...

299
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,594
You gotta think about last night
the way she does.

300
00:20:32,803 --> 00:20:35,055
Okay? You know, maybe...

301
00:20:36,056 --> 00:20:40,018
Maybe sleeping together was
the perfect way to say goodbye.

302
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:44,356
- But now she'll never know how he feels.
- Maybe that's okay, you know?

303
00:20:44,648 --> 00:20:46,775
Maybe it is better this way.

304
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:51,071
I mean, now... Now you can move on.

305
00:20:51,321 --> 00:20:53,949
I mean, you've been trying to for so long.

306
00:20:54,157 --> 00:20:56,993
Maybe now that you're
on different continents...

307
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,287
- Right?
- Yeah.

308
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:06,253
Maybe now you can actually do it,
you know.

309
00:21:07,254 --> 00:21:09,673
You can finally get over her.

310
00:21:13,677 --> 00:21:15,929
Yeah, that's true.

311
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,724
Except.

312
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:23,645
- I don't want to get over her.
- What?

313
00:21:23,812 --> 00:21:26,815
- I don't. I want to be with her.
- Really?

314
00:21:27,023 --> 00:21:29,484
- Yeah. I'm going to go after her.
- Yeah, you are!

315
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:34,114
Wait! Wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!

316
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:36,283
- My coat.
- This is so cool!

317
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,619
I have no idea what's going on,
but I am excited!

318
00:21:39,828 --> 00:21:42,330
- What do you think she's gonna say?
- I don't know.

319
00:21:42,497 --> 00:21:47,085
But even if she shoots me down,
at least I won't spend my life wondering...

320
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:49,796
...what would have happened.
Where is my coat?

321
00:21:49,963 --> 00:21:54,259
You didn't bring one! My cab's
downstairs. I'll drive you to the airport.

322
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:55,886
- Wish me luck.
- Hurry!

323
00:21:56,052 --> 00:21:57,637
Good luck!

324
00:22:08,398 --> 00:22:11,401
- There's no seat belts!
- That's okay. If we hit anything...

325
00:22:11,568 --> 00:22:16,656
...the engine will explode,
so it's better if you're thrown from the car.

326
00:22:16,823 --> 00:22:19,910
- All right, all right. Let's do this.
- Okay!

327
00:22:21,328 --> 00:22:22,913
- Hey!
- 80th and East End.

328
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:26,458
- No. I don't take passengers.
- The law makes you accept any fare.

329
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,668
You don't understand.
This cab isn't real.

330
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,754
What's your medallion number?

331
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:33,298
My medallion number is,
get out of the cab!

332
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,092
- What?
- Get out of the cab!

333
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:45,602
Oh, hey, can I give you guys
your housewarming gift now?

334
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:48,814
- Now, that you can do.
- All right.

335
00:22:57,656 --> 00:23:01,952
Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.?

336
00:23:03,495 --> 00:23:06,373
Don't hide from Mama!

337
00:23:14,673 --> 00:23:16,007
You can open your eyes now.

338
00:23:16,174 --> 00:23:18,468
- Are we off the bridge?
- Yes!

339
00:23:18,635 --> 00:23:24,224
- Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
- Yeah, she jumped right back up.

340
00:23:24,724 --> 00:23:28,645
- Oh, my God. Phoebe, slow down!
- Do you want to get to Rachel in time?

341
00:23:28,895 --> 00:23:30,939
Yes, but I don't want
to die in your cab.

342
00:23:31,231 --> 00:23:34,734
You should have thought of that
before you got in!

343
00:23:35,151 --> 00:23:36,820
- Tollbooth.
- What?

344
00:23:37,028 --> 00:23:39,281
Toll booth!

345
00:23:39,447 --> 00:23:42,158
Four bucks. There are quarters
in the glove compartment.

346
00:23:44,452 --> 00:23:46,121
Hurry!

347
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,498
Okay. Aah!

348
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,586
Damn, that window's clean.

349
00:23:53,587 --> 00:23:56,089
Quack, quack. Tweet, tweet.
Quack, quack.

350
00:23:56,423 --> 00:23:58,633
Tweet, tweet. Quack, quack.

351
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:03,597
Tweet, tweet. Quack, quack.
Tweet, tweet. Quack, tweet, quack.

352
00:24:04,472 --> 00:24:07,100
We were wondering
what was taking so long...

353
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:10,562
...but now we understand.
You were doing this.

354
00:24:12,606 --> 00:24:15,775
Okay. I wanted to surprise you, but...

355
00:24:15,942 --> 00:24:20,280
For your housewarming gift,
I got you a baby chick and a baby duck.

356
00:24:20,697 --> 00:24:22,991
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?

357
00:24:23,158 --> 00:24:28,705
Oh, great. Just what you want for
a new house with infants. Bird feces!

358
00:24:28,872 --> 00:24:31,541
But they must've jumped off the table.
Now they're gone!

359
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:33,293
Don't worry, we'll find them.

360
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,378
- I'm gonna go check on the twins.
- All right.

361
00:24:36,796 --> 00:24:39,215
Oh, God! What did I just step on?

362
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:42,302
- It's okay. It's just an egg roll.
- Oh.

363
00:24:42,469 --> 00:24:44,888
You stepped on my egg roll?

364
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:49,100
I'm sorry. I didn't know to look
for Chinese food on the floor.

365
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:50,936
Just put it on a plate and leave.

366
00:24:55,065 --> 00:24:58,652
- Okay. Let's find these birds.
- All right.

367
00:25:01,404 --> 00:25:04,407
Wait, wait. You hear that?

368
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:11,206
- They're in the table!
- Well, that can't be good.

369
00:25:11,373 --> 00:25:13,375
- We gotta get them out of there!
- How?

370
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:16,294
Maybe we can lure them out.
You know any birdcalls?

371
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:19,130
Oh, tons. I'm quite the Woodsman.

372
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,593
Well, maybe we can just
tip the table a little.

373
00:25:23,802 --> 00:25:26,596
Joey, wait! The ball!

374
00:25:42,654 --> 00:25:43,989
So, what do we do?

375
00:25:44,155 --> 00:25:46,116
Maybe we can open this up somehow.

376
00:25:46,282 --> 00:25:47,909
Okay.

377
00:25:49,577 --> 00:25:52,747
No. It's all glued together.

378
00:25:52,956 --> 00:25:55,959
Does that mean
we have to bust it open?

379
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:59,921
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Oh, my God.

380
00:26:00,088 --> 00:26:05,010
I know. it's... It's the foosball table.

381
00:26:06,761 --> 00:26:09,097
All right, you know what?
We don't have a choice.

382
00:26:09,264 --> 00:26:13,059
It's like I would have said in that
sci-fi movie if I'd have gotten the part.

383
00:26:14,394 --> 00:26:17,564
Those are our men in there,
and we have to get them out...

384
00:26:18,273 --> 00:26:21,735
...even if I have to sacrifice
the most important thing in my life...

385
00:26:21,901 --> 00:26:23,903
...my time machine.

386
00:26:25,447 --> 00:26:28,366
- Did that movie ever get made?
- It did not.

387
00:26:32,537 --> 00:26:35,331
Jack Weinberg,
white courtesy phone. Jack Weinberg.

388
00:26:35,498 --> 00:26:37,834
- Ross, where are you going?
- Uh, to talk to Rachel.

389
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:40,670
Isn't that why we took a ride
in the death cab?

390
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:42,672
You're walking up to her at the gate?

391
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:45,508
Have you never chased anyone
through the airport before?

392
00:26:45,717 --> 00:26:48,011
Not since my cop show got canceled.

393
00:26:49,095 --> 00:26:51,514
You have to get a ticket
to get past security.

394
00:26:51,723 --> 00:26:55,685
- What? We're never gonna make it.
- Not with that attitude. Now, haul ass!

395
00:26:58,104 --> 00:27:02,400
Okay, if you could all walk slower,
that'd be great.

396
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:12,452
- Madame, your passport, please.
- Oh, my God.

397
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:15,330
I was afraid I wouldn't remember
any of my high school French.

398
00:27:15,497 --> 00:27:18,333
But I understood every word
you just said.

399
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,337
- Your boarding pass, please.
- Oh, sure.

400
00:27:23,004 --> 00:27:24,297
Oh...

401
00:27:24,589 --> 00:27:28,134
Shoot, I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.

402
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,304
- Madame, if you don't have your...
- I have it, I have it!

403
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,473
Oh...

404
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,812
Okay, I can't find it, but I remember
that I was in seat 32C...

405
00:27:38,978 --> 00:27:41,648
...because that's my bra size.

406
00:27:42,482 --> 00:27:44,192
You must have your boarding pass...

407
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,821
You know what? If I was in 36D,
we would not be having this problem.

408
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,081
- Hi. I need a ticket.
- Just one?

409
00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:01,084
I drive you here, and I don't get
to see how it works out?

410
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:05,755
- Fine. Two tickets. I need two tickets.
- We're on our honeymoon.

411
00:28:07,215 --> 00:28:10,468
- And the destination?
- I don't care. Whatever's the cheapest.

412
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,971
I'm so lucky I married you.

413
00:28:15,223 --> 00:28:19,310
Oh, shoot. Damn it. Where is it?

414
00:28:20,228 --> 00:28:23,565
I found it. I found it.
I told you I would find it.

415
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:25,984
In your face. You're a different person.

416
00:28:27,527 --> 00:28:29,362
Sorry.

417
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:33,741
Okay. Flight 421, Paris.

418
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,953
- I don't see it. Do you see it?
- No. Did we miss it?

419
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,456
No, no, it's impossible.
It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.

420
00:28:40,623 --> 00:28:43,209
Maybe we have the flight number wrong.

421
00:28:43,376 --> 00:28:45,336
God.

422
00:28:47,589 --> 00:28:49,299
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.

423
00:28:49,465 --> 00:28:50,842
What?

424
00:28:51,926 --> 00:28:53,261
Hey. Hey, listen...

425
00:28:53,469 --> 00:28:57,640
You wouldn't believe the cute noises
the twins are making. Wait, listen.

426
00:28:57,849 --> 00:29:00,059
But Monica...

427
00:29:00,226 --> 00:29:04,606
Monica. Monica. Monica. Monica.

428
00:29:05,565 --> 00:29:07,358
I'm sorry. They were doing it before.

429
00:29:07,567 --> 00:29:10,987
- That's all right. Listen, listen.
- Oh, wait, wait. Here they go again.

430
00:29:11,154 --> 00:29:15,116
Monica. Monica. Monica. Monica.

431
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,035
- Monica?
- Isn't that cute?

432
00:29:17,243 --> 00:29:20,163
That is precious! Listen...

433
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:23,625
- I need Rachel's flight information.
- Oh, okay.

434
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:29,589
- All right, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
- I have that. It's not on the board.

435
00:29:29,756 --> 00:29:33,927
That's what it says here. Flight 421.
Leaves at 8:40. Newark Airport.

436
00:29:34,135 --> 00:29:36,429
- What?
- Newark Airport.

437
00:29:36,638 --> 00:29:41,100
- Why? Where are you?
- JFK.

438
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,217
Don't worry, you guys!
We're gonna get you out of there!

439
00:30:15,218 --> 00:30:18,930
And we're also gonna buy you
tiny bird hearing aids.

440
00:30:24,644 --> 00:30:27,981
Okay. Here goes.

441
00:30:32,694 --> 00:30:34,362
What's the matter?

442
00:30:35,071 --> 00:30:38,449
I need to say goodbye to the table first.

443
00:30:40,034 --> 00:30:41,869
I understand.

444
00:30:42,537 --> 00:30:44,205
Okay.

445
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:50,211
Table...

446
00:30:52,005 --> 00:30:55,550
...you have given us
so many great times.

447
00:30:56,843 --> 00:31:03,474
And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel...

448
00:31:03,891 --> 00:31:07,353
All of you guys. What can I say?

449
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,026
You guys make us look good.

450
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:19,365
- You want to say anything?
- I don't know.

451
00:31:20,742 --> 00:31:25,246
Except that, for one last time...

452
00:31:25,705 --> 00:31:28,333
Good game. Good game. Good game.

453
00:31:32,378 --> 00:31:34,047
- Good game.
- Yeah.

454
00:31:37,508 --> 00:31:39,510
Okay. Here we go.

455
00:31:47,602 --> 00:31:49,604
I can't do it.

456
00:31:50,396 --> 00:31:52,023
Well, I can't do it either.

457
00:31:53,232 --> 00:31:56,235
- Hey. Did you find them?
- Yeah. They're stuck inside the table.

458
00:31:56,402 --> 00:31:59,113
And we have to bust it open,
but neither of us can do it.

459
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:04,494
Oh, well, sure. It's got to be so hard.

460
00:32:04,744 --> 00:32:06,746
I'll do it. Give me.

461
00:32:11,626 --> 00:32:14,420
Phoebe! No, no, no!

462
00:32:16,923 --> 00:32:19,592
Wow, I've never gone this fast before.

463
00:32:19,842 --> 00:32:23,096
Phoebe, forget it, okay?
Newark is, like, an hour away.

464
00:32:23,262 --> 00:32:25,098
There's no way we'll make it in time.

465
00:32:25,348 --> 00:32:29,102
- She's got her cell. You could call her.
- I am not doing this over the phone.

466
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:31,104
You don't have any other choice.

467
00:32:38,444 --> 00:32:40,363
- Hello?
- Rachel. Oh, good.

468
00:32:40,571 --> 00:32:42,657
By the way,
did you just get on the plane?

469
00:32:42,824 --> 00:32:44,617
- Yeah.
- We would have caught her...

470
00:32:44,784 --> 00:32:47,328
- ...if we were at the right airport.
- Yay.

471
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,873
Um, Rachel, hang on.

472
00:32:51,082 --> 00:32:53,292
No. No. No.

473
00:32:53,501 --> 00:32:55,211
Phoebe, is everything okay?

474
00:32:56,337 --> 00:32:57,463
Um...

475
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:02,343
Actually, no. No.
You have to get off the plane.

476
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,470
- What? Why?
- I have this feeling that...

477
00:33:04,637 --> 00:33:10,309
...something's wrong with it.
Something is wrong with the left phalange.

478
00:33:12,311 --> 00:33:15,189
Oh, honey, I'm sure there's
nothing wrong with the plane.

479
00:33:15,356 --> 00:33:20,653
Look, I have to go. I love you, and I
will call you the minute I get to Paris.

480
00:33:21,654 --> 00:33:23,156
Um, ahem...

481
00:33:23,322 --> 00:33:26,367
- What was that?
- Oh, that was just my crazy friend.

482
00:33:26,534 --> 00:33:30,079
She told me to get off the plane
because she had a "feeling" that there...

483
00:33:30,246 --> 00:33:33,916
...was something wrong
with the left phalange.

484
00:33:34,709 --> 00:33:38,337
- Okay. Uh, that doesn't sound good.
- Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.

485
00:33:38,504 --> 00:33:41,299
She comes up with this stuff,
and she's almost never right.

486
00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:44,135
- But she is sometimes.
- Well...

487
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,598
- What are you doing?
- I can't take this plane now.

488
00:33:48,764 --> 00:33:52,101
- Excuse me, sir. Where are you going?
- I have to get off this plane.

489
00:33:52,268 --> 00:33:56,439
Her friend has a feeling something's wrong
with the left phalange.

490
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,487
Could I get some peanuts?

491
00:34:04,197 --> 00:34:06,949
- What's wrong with the plane?
- There's nothing wrong.

492
00:34:07,158 --> 00:34:10,036
- The left phalange.
- There's no "phalange."

493
00:34:10,244 --> 00:34:12,955
Oh, my God. This plane
doesn't even have a phalange.

494
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,584
- I'm not flying on it.
- Please sit down.

495
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:21,214
- What's going on'?
- We're getting off. There is no phalange!

496
00:34:24,759 --> 00:34:27,303
This is ridiculous. I...

497
00:34:29,555 --> 00:34:32,058
Yeah, okay.

498
00:34:39,941 --> 00:34:43,110
All right. My job here is done.

499
00:34:43,736 --> 00:34:46,656
That was impressive.

500
00:34:46,822 --> 00:34:50,451
Yeah. You didn't even use the tools
for most of it.

501
00:34:51,452 --> 00:34:53,246
Yeah, they were just slowing me down.

502
00:34:53,621 --> 00:34:58,459
All right. I gotta get back to the babies.
See you girls later.

503
00:35:01,921 --> 00:35:05,216
- Sorry about the table, man.
- Yeah.

504
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,552
You gonna buy a new one?

505
00:35:08,594 --> 00:35:11,138
Probably not. No.

506
00:35:11,305 --> 00:35:14,433
I don't know how much I'm gonna
want to play after you go.

507
00:35:17,603 --> 00:35:20,856
- Well, at least we got these little guys out.
- Yeah.

508
00:35:21,023 --> 00:35:23,526
Aw, we were worried about you.

509
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,488
Hm.

510
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:32,326
I guess I better get used to things
crapping in my hand, huh?

511
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,296
I'm gonna miss these little guys.

512
00:35:43,462 --> 00:35:45,298
It was nice having birds around again.

513
00:35:47,133 --> 00:35:50,886
Hey, you know what? Maybe we
should keep them here with you.

514
00:35:51,304 --> 00:35:53,973
- What?
- Yeah. We got a lot going on right now.

515
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,310
And plus, here,
they'd have their own room.

516
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:00,855
I could get a goose!

517
00:36:02,398 --> 00:36:06,110
You know, I think you're set
with the poultry.

518
00:36:08,321 --> 00:36:10,531
Thanks, man. You hear that, you guys?

519
00:36:10,698 --> 00:36:14,744
You're gonna get to stay here.
And it's good...

520
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:17,330
...you know, because, uh...

521
00:36:17,997 --> 00:36:20,666
Because now you have a reason
to come visit.

522
00:36:23,502 --> 00:36:26,714
I think there may be another reason.

523
00:36:34,555 --> 00:36:36,349
So, uh...

524
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,897
Awkward hug
or lame cool-guy handshake?

525
00:36:44,523 --> 00:36:46,859
Yeah, well, you know,
lame cool-guy handshake.

526
00:37:05,711 --> 00:37:11,092
- Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.
- And you fixed the phalange?

527
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:14,095
Yes. The phalange's fixed.

528
00:37:14,261 --> 00:37:18,432
In fact, we've put a whole lot of extra
phalanges on board, just in case.

529
00:37:20,726 --> 00:37:23,604
Paging Mr. Anderson.
Mr. Josh Anderson.

530
00:37:23,771 --> 00:37:25,523
- Where is she?
- I don't see her.

531
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,900
- Rachel! Rachel Green!
- There she is!

532
00:37:28,067 --> 00:37:31,445
Rachel! Rachel!

533
00:37:31,737 --> 00:37:35,157
- Whoa, do you have a boarding pass?
- No. I just have to talk to someone.

534
00:37:35,324 --> 00:37:37,118
I'm sorry. You need a boarding pass.

535
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:41,914
- No, no. But you don't...
- Rachel!

536
00:37:42,665 --> 00:37:46,043
What? Oh, my God.
What are you guys doing here?

537
00:37:46,877 --> 00:37:48,921
Okay. You're on.

538
00:37:49,171 --> 00:37:52,425
What? What, Ross? Okay, you're
scaring me. What's going on?

539
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:55,469
- Okay. Thing is...
- Yeah.

540
00:37:56,303 --> 00:37:58,514
- Don't go.
- What?

541
00:37:58,681 --> 00:38:03,686
Please, please stay with me. I am
so in love with you. Please don't go.

542
00:38:04,812 --> 00:38:07,022
- Oh, my God.
- I know. I know.

543
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:11,944
I shouldn't have waited till now to say it,
but, um... That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry.

544
00:38:12,111 --> 00:38:14,989
But I'm telling you now. I love you.

545
00:38:16,115 --> 00:38:21,328
- Do not get on this plane.
- Miss, are you boarding the plane?

546
00:38:21,787 --> 00:38:23,456
(Hey, he)'-

547
00:38:23,914 --> 00:38:28,294
I know you love me. I know you do.

548
00:38:28,836 --> 00:38:30,504
- Miss
- l...

549
00:38:30,671 --> 00:38:33,340
I... I have to get on the plane.

550
00:38:33,507 --> 00:38:34,800
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

551
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:37,636
- No, you don't.
- I do. They're waiting for me, Ross.

552
00:38:37,803 --> 00:38:41,307
I can't do this right now, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

553
00:38:41,474 --> 00:38:43,392
Rachel.

554
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:45,978
I'm so sorry.

555
00:39:00,951 --> 00:39:02,411
I really thought she'd stay.

556
00:39:02,661 --> 00:39:04,663
I know.

557
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,957
I'm sorry.

558
00:39:20,012 --> 00:39:23,265
Well, that's it.

559
00:39:23,474 --> 00:39:24,892
Everything's packed.

560
00:39:26,685 --> 00:39:28,103
Wow.

561
00:39:28,854 --> 00:39:31,190
- This is weird.
- I know.

562
00:39:31,357 --> 00:39:32,608
Yeah.

563
00:39:33,192 --> 00:39:36,195
Uh, does this mean
there's nothing to eat?

564
00:39:37,863 --> 00:39:39,865
I put three lasagnas in your freezer.

565
00:39:41,534 --> 00:39:43,869
I love you.

566
00:39:46,705 --> 00:39:49,375
- Hey.
- Hey. Did you guys make it in time?

567
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:53,712
Yeah, yeah. He talked to her,
but, um, she got on the plane anyway.

568
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:57,550
Where's Ross?

569
00:39:57,716 --> 00:39:59,927
He went home.
He didn't want to see anybody.

570
00:40:17,778 --> 00:40:21,782
Ross. Hi, it's me.

571
00:40:22,032 --> 00:40:26,745
I just got back on the plane,
and I just feel awful.

572
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:31,417
That is so not how I wanted things
to end with us.

573
00:40:32,585 --> 00:40:35,588
It's just that I wasn't expecting
to see you.

574
00:40:35,754 --> 00:40:39,258
And all of a sudden you're there
and saying these things.

575
00:40:40,676 --> 00:40:43,679
Now I'm just sitting here and thinking...

576
00:40:43,846 --> 00:40:47,600
...of all the stuff I should have said
and I didn't.

577
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:51,645
I mean, I didn't even get to tell you
that I love you too.

578
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:55,774
Because of course I do. I love you.

579
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,778
I love you.

580
00:41:00,487 --> 00:41:02,448
I love you.

581
00:41:02,948 --> 00:41:07,286
What am I doing? I love you.

582
00:41:09,455 --> 00:41:12,458
I've got to see you.
I've got to get off this plane.

583
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:14,376
Oh, my God.

584
00:41:14,585 --> 00:41:17,630
- Okay, excuse me.
- Miss, please sit down.

585
00:41:17,796 --> 00:41:20,966
No, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry,
but I need to get off the plane.

586
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:24,178
- I need to tell someone that I love them.
- I can't let you off.

587
00:41:24,345 --> 00:41:27,306
Let her off the plane!

588
00:41:27,973 --> 00:41:29,808
You have to take your seat.

589
00:41:29,975 --> 00:41:32,394
Oh, please, miss.
You don't understand.

590
00:41:32,561 --> 00:41:35,147
Try to understand!

591
00:41:35,314 --> 00:41:38,150
Come on, miss, isn't there any way
that you can just let me off the...?

592
00:41:39,652 --> 00:41:41,528
No! No!

593
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:46,742
Oh, my God. Did she get off the plane?
Did she get off the plane?

594
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,829
I got off the plane.

595
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,675
You got off the plane.

596
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,606
I do love you.

597
00:42:17,815 --> 00:42:20,359
I love you too, and I am never
letting you go again.

598
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:23,862
Okay. Because this is where I want
to be. Okay? No more messing around.

599
00:42:24,071 --> 00:42:28,200
- I don't want to mess this up again.
- Me neither. We're done being stupid.

600
00:42:28,367 --> 00:42:31,036
Okay. It's you and me, all right?
This is it.

601
00:42:31,203 --> 00:42:34,873
This is it. Unless we're on a break.

602
00:42:44,633 --> 00:42:46,343
Don't make jokes now.

603
00:43:07,448 --> 00:43:10,409
Okay, please be careful with that.
It was my grandmother's. Be careful.

604
00:43:10,617 --> 00:43:12,202
Thank you.

605
00:43:12,411 --> 00:43:15,789
If that falls off the truck,
it wouldn't be the worst thing.

606
00:43:24,423 --> 00:43:26,050
Wow.

607
00:43:27,676 --> 00:43:29,386
I know.

608
00:43:29,595 --> 00:43:32,264
Seems smaller somehow.

609
00:43:33,724 --> 00:43:37,186
Has it always been purple?

610
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:43,901
Look around, you guys.
This was your first home.

611
00:43:45,152 --> 00:43:51,200
And it was a happy place,
filled with love and laughter.

612
00:43:51,366 --> 00:43:56,163
But more important, because
of rent control, it was a frigging steal.

613
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:05,047
Hey, do you realize that, at one time or
another, we all lived in this apartment?

614
00:44:05,631 --> 00:44:07,382
Oh, yeah. That's true.

615
00:44:07,591 --> 00:44:09,968
Uh, I haven't.

616
00:44:11,053 --> 00:44:14,306
What about that summer during college
that you lived with Grandma...

617
00:44:14,473 --> 00:44:17,267
...and you tried to make it as a dancer?

618
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,984
Do you realize we almost made it
10 years without that coming up?

619
00:44:30,405 --> 00:44:33,325
Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger
that we'd leave our keys.

620
00:44:33,492 --> 00:44:35,744
Oh, okay.

621
00:45:09,778 --> 00:45:13,157
- So I guess this is it.
- Yeah.

622
00:45:14,658 --> 00:45:16,118
I guess so.

623
00:45:18,245 --> 00:45:20,664
This is harder than I thought
it would be.

624
00:45:20,831 --> 00:45:23,375
Oh, it's gonna be okay.

625
00:45:26,003 --> 00:45:27,629
Come on.

626
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:39,099
Do you guys have to go to the new
house now, or do you have some time?

627
00:45:41,768 --> 00:45:43,145
We got some time.

628
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:47,733
- Okay. Should we get some coffee?
- Sure.

629
00:45:48,817 --> 00:45:50,402
Where?
