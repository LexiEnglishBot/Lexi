1
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:04,420
- Hi.
- Hi.

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:08,924
Hi. Yeah, hi. I'm, um, Phoebe Buffay
and I have babies coming out.

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,635
Okay.
Have you started having contractions?

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,638
Not yet. Um, I heard they really hurt.
Do they?

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,433
- Well...
- Oh, my God.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,102
Which of you is the father?

7
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:23,313
None of them are.
The father is my brother.

8
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,524
Okay.

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,403
I'll miss watching you
freak people out like that.

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,988
Pheebs...

11
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,824
This is for the babies
to look at someday.

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,660
Do you want to say anything
before it starts?

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,120
Okay. Um...

14
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,707
Hi, kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,127
Can't wait to see you.
Please don't hurt me.

16
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,298
What took you so long?

17
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,717
Your cab left when ours did.

18
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,223
We went back because
I forgot my jacket.

19
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,688
You're not wearing one.

20
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,067
Oh, man! I did it again!

21
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,737
Someone has to call
Frank and Alice.

22
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,156
My mom might...
What are you doing?

23
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,533
I've got to get the before shot.

24
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:13,340
We spoke to the nurse.
The reason your doctor is late...

25
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,592
...is because, uh, she's not coming.

26
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,804
- What?
- She hit her head in the shower.

27
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,432
Oh, my God. She's so stupid!

28
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,768
Pheebs, it's going to be okay.

29
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,772
I don't see three kids
coming out of your vagina.

30
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,404
Listen. The nurse said
the doctor is wonderful.

31
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,489
He's head of the department.

32
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,325
All right. Ooh. Oh, dear God, save me.

33
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,661
I'm having my first contraction.

34
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,955
- Oh, it's not bad.
- Okay.

35
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,502
And so the miracle of birth begins.
And I...

36
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,921
You okay?

37
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,257
Something hurts.

38
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:58,343
Ooh, it's sympathy pains.
Oh, that's so sweet.

39
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,888
I didn't know I cared that much.

40
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,892
- Hello.
- Hi.

41
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,770
I'm Dr. Harad.
I'll be delivering your babies.

42
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,357
You'll be in good hands.
I've been doing this a long time.

43
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,985
I'll be back to do your internal.

44
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,404
Just relax, everything looks great.

45
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,199
And also, I love Fonzie.

46
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,079
Did he just say he loves Fonzie?

47
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,123
That's what it sounded like.

48
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,000
All right.

49
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,378
Hey!

50
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,382
Am I late?
Nobody came out yet, right?

51
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,385
No, we haven't started yet.
Where's Alice?

52
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,972
Uh, Delaware. Until she gets here,
I'll be your coach.

53
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,184
Don't worry. She told me
about the LaMazda stuff.

54
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,646
If you get the babies out
by month's end...

55
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,731
...you get two percent financing.

56
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,441
Yeah.

57
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,572
Monica, you're going to be
very proud of me.

58
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,409
I just got us dates with two
unbelievably cute nurses.

59
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,953
Oh, my.

60
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,206
They're male nurses.

61
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,291
Heh, heh. Not in my head.

62
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,671
They want to take us out Saturday night.
What do you say?

63
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,715
Um...

64
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,387
- I don't think so.
- What?

65
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,097
What are you talking about?

66
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,059
You've been telling me to
get over Ross and move on.

67
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,395
I'm moving on and so are you.

68
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,105
Why don't you want to go?

69
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,399
Um...

70
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,151
Why don't you give me
a good reason...

71
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,696
...and I'll tell you if it's true.

72
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,284
- What?
- Harder than it sounds, isn't it?

73
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,453
You're coming.
And when they get off...

74
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,039
...we'll go get some Jello with them.

75
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,751
Yep. There's always room for Jello.

76
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,132
How do you make that dirty?

77
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,968
It's easy.
I can do it with anything.

78
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,763
Grandma's chicken salad...

79
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,605
Ross!

80
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,025
Get a shot of this.

81
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,570
Hey, babies, these are the headlines
when you were born.

82
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:25,532
Now girl baby, turn away.
And boy babies...

83
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,409
...check it out.

84
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,871
This is what naked women
looked like when you were born.

85
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,665
Now let's dive into the good stuff.

86
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,669
Okay, I'm having another one.

87
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,756
This one doesn't hurt eith...
Ooh, yes, it does! Ow.

88
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,050
Ow, ow, ow!

89
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,385
Ooh.

90
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,555
Ooh, I was kind of hoping that was it.

91
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,518
Where are Monica and Rachel, anyway?

92
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,730
A couple of nurses asked them out.
Maybe they're with them.

93
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,357
Really? Male nurses?

94
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,567
Yeah, I was bummed too.

95
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,737
So they're going on dates?

96
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,572
- When?
- I think Saturday.

97
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,786
- What's with him?
- Um, sympathy pains.

98
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:15,582
It was sweet at first, but now I think
he's trying to steal my thunder.

99
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,043
Okay.

100
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,087
Let's see what we got here.

101
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,924
Oh, you know, Fonzie dated triplets.

102
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,428
This Fonzie person you
keep referring to...

103
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,722
...is that another doctor?

104
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:31,973
Oh, no, no.

105
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,976
Fonzie is the nickname of
Arthur Fonzerelli.

106
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,437
The Fonz.

107
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,191
All right.

108
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,943
Soon.

109
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,489
It's not that weird, is it?

110
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,449
It's very weird.

111
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:54,371
I don't want some guy down there
telling me I'm "dilated-a-mundo."

112
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,584
He doesn't seem to be
impersonating Fonzie...

113
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,961
What are you doing?

114
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,674
Why are you defending him?
Just get me another doctor...

115
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,926
...who isn't crazy
and doesn't Fonzie!

116
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,679
- Again, it's not...
- Aah! Aah!

117
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,854
Hey, there you are.

118
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,523
Um, there's something you should know.

119
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,734
Is this about you dating the nurse?
Joey told me.

120
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,613
I am so fine.
You and I, we're just, nothing.

121
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,283
Just goofing around.

122
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:37,998
Um, I was about to tell you
I was getting out of it.

123
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:42,085
But, um, if we're just "goofing around,"
maybe I will go out with him.

124
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,379
Fine. Maybe I will too.

125
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,468
Hey! Look what I found
in the gift shop...

126
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,971
Oh. Get up! Get up! Get up!

127
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,186
Okay, Pheebs?

128
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,104
This is Dr. Oberman.

129
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,232
He has no strong feelings
about Fonzie...

130
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,569
...or any of the Happy Days gang.

131
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,655
You're going into what grade?

132
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:15,410
I'm actually a first-year resident.
I graduated early.

133
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,786
Uh-huh. Me too.

134
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:21,583
Ross, I should have specified
I'd need a grown-up doctor.

135
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,044
Really, I'm fully qualified...

136
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,295
Shh, Doogie. Shh.

137
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:32,177
Doesn't anybody understand that
I'm going to be having babies soon? Huh?

138
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,804
Go, little boy! Go!

139
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,019
Oh, cool. You made him cry!

140
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:50,320
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid
you've got kidney stones.

141
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,906
Uh, well, what else could it be?

142
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,116
It's kidney stones.

143
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,118
Or...

144
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,912
Kidney stones.

145
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,793
You're getting there.

146
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,254
These babies are very, very lucky.

147
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,505
They are? Why?

148
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,841
They'll be born
on the Fonz's half-birthday.

149
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,971
Happy birthday.

150
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,473
Just to clarify.

151
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,350
I'm not Fonzie.

152
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,646
Yeah.

153
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,488
It's a terrific thing that you're having
these babies for Frank and Alice.

154
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,365
- I know, it is.
- Yeah.

155
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,076
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Yeah.

156
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,996
I want to keep one.

157
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,877
Oh, I'm going to be on the news.

158
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,882
You've gotta be kidding.

159
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,719
You know you can't keep
one of these babies.

160
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,929
Maybe I can. You don't know.

161
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,183
I do. Frank and Alice will
want to keep all their children.

162
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,811
Maybe not. You know?

163
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,355
Three babies are a handful.

164
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,816
Maybe they'll want to unload one.

165
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:15,572
I hate to miss an opportunity
because I didn't ask.

166
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,951
Phoebe, no. This is insane.

167
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,286
Just ask him.

168
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,204
What? Me?

169
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,414
I can't ask him!

170
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,959
Do you know how inappropriate
that would be?

171
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,796
All I'm saying is, just talk to Frank.

172
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,298
Just feel him out.

173
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:37,135
No. I will not ask Frank
to give you one of his kids.

174
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,096
You're right.

175
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,854
Tell him it's for you.

176
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,816
Feeling better, sweetie?

177
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,818
Maybe a little.

178
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,820
Wish you hadn't seen me throw up.

179
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,615
Me too.

180
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,203
Hey. I just heard. What's up?

181
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,288
Kidney stones.

182
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:12,545
Ordinarily, we try to break
the stones up with shock waves.

183
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,131
But they're too close to the bladder.

184
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:19,427
Either we wait for you to pass them
or else go up the urethra...

185
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,637
Whoa!

186
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,850
No, no, no.
Nothing is going "up," okay?

187
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:30,522
"Up" is not an option.
What's a urethra?

188
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,901
Are you crazy?

189
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,031
Did you ask him?

190
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,158
No, I haven't had a chance yet.

191
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,035
I'm kind of on a clock here.

192
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,498
Oh, Fonzie.

193
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,421
You know who I always liked? Mork.

194
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,592
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.

195
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,596
Fonzie met Mork.

196
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,765
Mork froze Fonzie.

197
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,935
Yeah...

198
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,729
Yes...

199
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,149
...but Fonzie was already cool.

200
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,236
So he wasn't hurt. Right?

201
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,697
Yeah, that's right.

202
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,201
How you doing?

203
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,871
Okay. Doctor says any minute now.

204
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,624
You know, Alice is going
to be here so soon.

205
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:36,755
You couldn't just do me a favor
and, like, hold them in?

206
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:42,093
Sorry, I'm in the middle
of the last favor you asked me to do.

207
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,722
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi!

208
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:49,768
This is Dan, one of the guys
we're going out with on Saturday.

209
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,269
Dan, Monica.

210
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,604
Nice to meet you.

211
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,857
Hello, Dan.

212
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,820
I'm really looking forward
to Saturday night. Really! Really!

213
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,283
So Dan...

214
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,494
Nurse, not a doctor, huh?

215
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,662
Kind of girlie, isn't it?

216
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,167
- Chandler.
- That's okay.

217
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,086
I'm doing this to
get through medical school.

218
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,380
Oh.

219
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,926
And it didn't feel "girlie"
during the Gulf War.

220
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,594
Sure.

221
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,267
Thanks for doing that for us,
by the way.

222
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,981
Why wait till Saturday?
Are you free tomorrow?

223
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,067
Sure.
I'll get somebody to cover me.

224
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,860
Aw, great.

225
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,029
Hey, you and me, Saturday night?

226
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,240
- No.
- All right, very good!

227
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,036
This is a big one.

228
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,458
Unh! Get these things out of me!

229
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,671
Breathe! Breathe through the pain.

230
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,884
I want the drugs, Ross!

231
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,762
I do too! I do too!

232
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,810
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye.

233
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,895
- Hi.
- Hi.

234
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,023
That was Alice's mom.
Alice left five hours ago.

235
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,567
She should be here.

236
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,485
She'll make it on time.

237
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,445
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

238
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,573
So Frank...

239
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:30,118
Three babies.
Whoo, that just seems like a lot, huh?

240
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,161
Not to me.

241
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,123
Fair enough.

242
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,423
You're at 10 centimeters.
Time to start having babies.

243
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,383
I want only the father here.

244
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,011
- We love you.
- Good luck.

245
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,680
- Bye, Dan!
- Uh, bye, Monica.

246
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,021
I need a clamp, a sterile towel
and Channel 31.

247
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,230
What is that?

248
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,652
Oh, my God!

249
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,239
Oh, no, no! It's a good one.
Fonzie plays the bongos.

250
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,492
Ready? Time to try pushing.

251
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,578
Ready? Time to try peeing.

252
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:22,086
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
It's almost time to try peeing.

253
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,424
Push. Concentrate on pushing.

254
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,301
I see the head.

255
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,345
Yes, it is a head!

256
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,348
Keep pushing. Come on.

257
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,892
I can't believe somebody's coming out!

258
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,478
There's somebody coming out of you!

259
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,229
It's my son!

260
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,856
All right.

261
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,485
Here's your first baby.

262
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,697
Yes!

263
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,699
Yes! We got a baby boy!

264
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,536
Frank Junior, Junior!

265
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,455
How does he look?

266
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,040
So gross!

267
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,504
Okay. You ready to push again?

268
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,048
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.

269
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:10,593
Come on, you can do it.
You can do it.

270
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,769
Yeah!

271
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,106
Little Leslie's here!
We got another one!

272
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,485
Oh, my God! I can't believe
I have two children.

273
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,405
How scary is that?

274
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:38,579
Come on, little Chandler,
it's time to be born.

275
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,541
He's coming! Yes, he's coming!

276
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,922
Hey, where's his thing?

277
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,678
Chandler's a girl!

278
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,141
Oh, God. Kindergarten flashback.

279
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:03,146
They read the sonogram wrong,
because they thought it was a boy.

280
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,440
But Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!

281
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,316
Okay, keep saying it.

282
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,779
- Am I too late?
- No, no. Everything's okay.

283
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,407
There's 30 fingers and 30 toes.

284
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,075
We have our babies?

285
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,452
Yeah.

286
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,579
We have our babies.

287
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,095
Oh, my God.

288
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,722
You did it, man.

289
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,892
Would you like to see them?

290
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,522
They're so small.

291
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,907
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Great.

292
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,206
Are you really going to date
that nurse man?

293
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,417
You and I are just "goofing around."

294
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,253
I thought, why not
"goof around" with him?

295
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:16,344
I don't know if you've looked up
"goofing around" in the dictionary.

296
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,221
Well, I have...

297
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,183
...and the technical definition is:

298
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:26,729
"Two friends who care a lot
about each other...

299
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,274
...and have amazing sex...

300
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:36,405
...and just want to spend
more time together."

301
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:41,327
But if you have this new
dictionary that gets you mad at me...

302
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,247
...then we have to get you
my original dictionary.

303
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,793
I am so bad at this.

304
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,256
- You're better than you think you are.
- Really?

305
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,924
Okay. So if...

306
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,261
- Know when to stop.
- I sensed that I should stop.

307
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,931
- So we're okay?
- Yeah.

308
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,934
I'm gonna go tell Dan that
it's not going to happen.

309
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,356
- Don't do the dance.
- Right.

310
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,737
You're my favorite.

311
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,949
- Which one do you have?
- I don't care.

312
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,660
Hi.

313
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,203
Hey.

314
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:28,082
Frank and Alice want me to tell you
they're making phone calls.

315
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,627
Did you talk to them
about, you know...

316
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,256
Yeah, um...

317
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,925
No, honey.

318
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,261
Oh, okay.

319
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,140
It was a long shot.

320
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:50,605
You guys? Can I just have
a second alone with the babies?

321
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,523
Yeah.

322
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,630
So here you are.

323
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:20,426
Seems like yesterday I was talking
to you in that petri dish.

324
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,477
Everyone said labor
was the hardest thing.

325
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,687
But they were wrong. This is.

326
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,152
Well, I had the most fun with you guys.

327
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,531
I wish I could take you home
and see you every day.

328
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,579
I'll settle for being your favorite aunt.

329
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:54,001
I know Alice's sister has a pool,
but you lived in me.

330
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,509
Okay, so we're cool.

331
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,637
We're going to be great.

332
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,556
Little high-fives.

333
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,725
Aah, aah, aah.

334
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,278
Well, if you're going to cry...

335
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,797
Phoebe, we are so proud of you.
You're amazing!

336
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,132
I know.

337
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,177
Does it hurt as bad as they say?

338
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,471
You won't be able to take it.

339
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,685
Now that little Chandler is a girl,
what'll they name her?

340
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,437
They'll call her Chandler.

341
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,232
Kind of a masculine name,
don't you think?

342
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,901
It works on you.
