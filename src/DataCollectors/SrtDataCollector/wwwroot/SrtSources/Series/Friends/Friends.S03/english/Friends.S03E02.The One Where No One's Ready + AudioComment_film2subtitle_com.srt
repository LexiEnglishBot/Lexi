1
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:04,613
All right, they got water,
orange juice...

2
00:00:04,783 --> 00:00:07,377
...and what looks like cider.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,909
Taste it.

4
00:00:14,026 --> 00:00:16,586
Yeah, it's fat.
l drank fat!

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,389
l know, l did that two minutes ago.

6
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:25,702
Hey, Mr. Tux.

7
00:00:25,904 --> 00:00:28,532
-Why aren't you dressed?
-We have a half-hour.

8
00:00:28,707 --> 00:00:31,938
That was four minutes ago.
We have to be out the door at 7:40.

9
00:00:32,177 --> 00:00:35,738
Relax, we'll be ready. lt takes us
two minutes to get dressed.

10
00:00:35,914 --> 00:00:38,109
l'd feel better if you
got dressed now.

11
00:00:38,617 --> 00:00:40,016
-Okay.
-Okay.

12
00:00:43,855 --> 00:00:45,880
Oh, look at you. All sexy.

13
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:47,047
Really?

14
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:58,131
-How come you didn't come over earlier?
-Because l'm a stupid, stupid man.

15
00:00:58,837 --> 00:01:01,738
-Hey, Ross, want some cider?
-No.

16
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:05,004
So you're pretty close, huh?

17
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,668
-Makeup's on. Hair's done.
-l just have to get dressed.

18
00:01:08,947 --> 00:01:11,711
And that takes what,
six or seven minutes?

19
00:01:11,984 --> 00:01:14,418
Yeah. Once l figure out
what l'm wearing.

20
00:01:17,155 --> 00:01:18,383
Glass of fat?

21
00:01:20,092 --> 00:01:22,253
The One Where No One's Ready

22
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,607
What's the matter?
You nervous about your speech?

23
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:13,242
Nope.

24
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,147
-You wanna hear it?
-Am l in it?

25
00:02:21,753 --> 00:02:24,551
After l thank everyone
for giving to the museum...

26
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,554
...l sing a song about
the wonder that is Joey.

27
00:02:31,663 --> 00:02:33,255
Hello! You look great!

28
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:35,659
Thank you. l know, though.

29
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:41,365
You see this? This is a person
who is ready to go.

30
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,529
Phoebe, you....

31
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,133
You are my star.

32
00:02:45,243 --> 00:02:47,711
Well, you're my lucky penny.

33
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:55,580
All right, l took the quiz. And it
turns out l do put career before men.

34
00:02:58,657 --> 00:02:59,885
Get up.

35
00:03:00,058 --> 00:03:01,252
What?

36
00:03:01,426 --> 00:03:04,054
-You're in my seat.
-How is this your seat?

37
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:10,433
-Because l was sitting there.
-But you left.

38
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:13,561
Well, it's not like l went to Spain.

39
00:03:14,406 --> 00:03:16,806
l went to the bathroom.
You knew l'd be back.

40
00:03:16,975 --> 00:03:18,772
What's the big deal?
Sit somewhere else!

41
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:22,538
The big deal is l was
sitting there last! So...

42
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:24,078
...it's my seat.

43
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:28,780
Well, actually, the last place
you were sitting was in there, so....

44
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:31,847
You guys, you know what?
lt doesn't matter.

45
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,618
You both have to go get dressed before
the big vein in my head pops.

46
00:03:36,895 --> 00:03:39,659
l just have to do one thing.
lt's not a big deal.

47
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:41,057
Get up!

48
00:03:44,102 --> 00:03:46,366
Phoebe, you look great!

49
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:48,803
All right already.

50
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:51,606
Are you gonna do magic?

51
00:03:54,112 --> 00:03:55,977
That's funny. Change.

52
00:03:56,148 --> 00:03:58,013
-l just got in.
-l don't care.

53
00:03:58,283 --> 00:04:03,186
-lt starts at 8. We can't be late.
-He could not, would not, want to wait.

54
00:04:03,922 --> 00:04:06,652
Our table is in front.
My boss will be there.

55
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:09,416
Everyone will see if we arrive
after it starts.

56
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:11,562
Has somebody been drinking my fat?

57
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:16,966
Does this look like something a
paleontologist's girlfriend would wear?

58
00:04:17,135 --> 00:04:19,660
l don't know.
You might be the first one.

59
00:04:20,972 --> 00:04:23,236
-Rach, did you check the machine?
-No.

60
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:27,606
Wait. This is the outfit that makes
my calves look fat. Never mind.

61
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:34,283
Well, Joey, l wrote
a little song today.

62
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:36,209
lt's called, ''Get up!''

63
00:04:37,756 --> 00:04:40,816
l wish there was something
l could do to help you.

64
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:44,826
Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.
Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.

65
00:04:44,996 --> 00:04:47,658
All right. You can have the chair.

66
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:51,165
-Really?
-Oh, my. Would you look at that?

67
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:56,697
It's me, I'm coming over.

68
00:04:56,942 --> 00:04:59,536
What if I'm already there
when you play this message?

69
00:04:59,778 --> 00:05:01,678
ls that too spooky?

70
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:06,215
Hi, Rach, are you there?
It's me. Pick up.

71
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:08,685
Rachel? Rach?

72
00:05:08,854 --> 00:05:10,481
What?

73
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,983
Never mind.

74
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,883
Hi, Rach, it's your sister.

75
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:19,758
Did you ever sleep with Donnie Mazzio
because last night he kept shouting:

76
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:21,956
""Two for two. ""

77
00:05:23,468 --> 00:05:27,734
Do you want me to get dressed
or hear a long story about a hayride?

78
00:05:27,906 --> 00:05:30,238
Are you only asking him because....

79
00:05:35,513 --> 00:05:38,209
Monica, it's Richard. Call me.

80
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:44,553
ls that message old or new?

81
00:05:44,723 --> 00:05:46,315
Old or new? Old or new?

82
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:49,492
lt's definitely old.
Didn't you hear the double beep?

83
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:52,027
What if it's new?
We agreed not to talk.

84
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,028
lt could be important.
Shouldn't l call him back?

85
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:57,667
Honey, you did call him back.
lt's old.

86
00:05:57,869 --> 00:05:59,962
Yeah, see, Mon, listen. Listen.

87
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:02,298
When Carol and l broke up...

88
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,600
...l went through the same thing.
You know what l did?

89
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,801
l got dressed.

90
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:13,317
Really, really quickly, okay? Okay?

91
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:15,543
There we go. There we go.

92
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:18,755
You know what? Don't get up.
Just sit there.

93
00:06:19,024 --> 00:06:22,050
l just hope you don't mind
my hand right here.

94
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:26,660
Not touching. Can't get mad!
Not touching. Can't get mad!

95
00:06:26,831 --> 00:06:29,061
Not touching. Can't get mad!

96
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:33,701
Oh, my God!
You rotten boys!

97
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:37,139
-Sorry, Phoebe.
-What am l gonna do?

98
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:41,336
Don't rub it! What gets out hummus?
What gets out hummus?

99
00:06:41,513 --> 00:06:43,606
Monica!
What gets out hummus?

100
00:06:44,582 --> 00:06:48,416
lf it is a new message,
what is he calling to say?

101
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:51,153
Okay, thanks. Yeah, l'll try that.

102
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,956
Maybe he called to say you're obsessive.

103
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:57,253
-So should l call him back?
-No!

104
00:06:58,663 --> 00:06:59,687
No!

105
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,367
Okay, do these match?

106
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:06,732
-Yes, they definitely match.
-They don't match.

107
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:13,209
What? They didn't match.

108
00:07:13,378 --> 00:07:17,075
-Fine, we'll both sit in the chair.
-Fine with me.

109
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:22,351
l am so comfortable.

110
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:24,544
Me too.

111
00:07:24,923 --> 00:07:28,518
ln fact, l think l might
be a little too comfortable.

112
00:07:28,693 --> 00:07:30,422
All right.

113
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,191
Okay, we have 1 9 minutes.
l want you to go and change.

114
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:40,632
When you come back, Joey will go
change and he'll have vacated the chair.

115
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,097
-Okay.
-All right.

116
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:44,137
Fine. l'm going.

117
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:47,710
When l get back, it's Chair City.
And l'm the guy...

118
00:07:47,912 --> 00:07:49,641
...who's sitting in a chair!

119
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,081
ls this a little too--?

120
00:07:53,318 --> 00:07:55,513
Pheebs? What happened?

121
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:57,052
l got the hummus.

122
00:07:57,222 --> 00:08:01,181
Oh, honey, we'll find you something.
You wanna wear my black jacket?

123
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:03,588
-lt won't go with this dress.
-You're right.

124
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:08,322
-Well, let's just get you out of that.
-No, no, no. Not ''out of that.''

125
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,731
-Not out of clothes.
-Can Phoebe borrow your green dress?

126
00:08:11,903 --> 00:08:13,200
l called him.

127
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:17,167
Yes. l got his machine
and l left a message.

128
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:18,876
But it's okay. lt's okay...

129
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,273
...because it was, like,
a casual, breezy message.

130
00:08:22,547 --> 00:08:23,571
lt was breezy.

131
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:26,473
God, what if it wasn't breezy?

132
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:31,020
How could it not be breezy? No.
Because you're in such a breezy place.

133
00:08:31,723 --> 00:08:36,057
l got it. l will play my message and
you can tell me if it's breezy enough.

134
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:38,320
But how you gonna do that?

135
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,321
l know the code
to his answering machine.

136
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:44,091
Okay, Mon, l really don't think
this is the--

137
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:47,065
Okay, you're dialing.
You are dialing.

138
00:08:58,349 --> 00:09:01,147
-What's going on?
-Monica's beeping into Richard's machine.

139
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:02,581
ls she crazy?

140
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:04,619
Like a straw.

141
00:09:05,857 --> 00:09:07,347
Remember? Crazy straws?

142
00:09:08,526 --> 00:09:12,394
Hi, this is Richard.
Please leave a message at the tone.

143
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:15,260
You have two new messages.

144
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:17,128
Wow, what a cool job.

145
00:09:17,402 --> 00:09:19,370
You have two new messages.

146
00:09:21,172 --> 00:09:23,538
Please pass the pie.

147
00:09:25,877 --> 00:09:29,904
Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking
in because I got a message...

148
00:09:30,081 --> 00:09:34,211
...from you and didn't know
if it was old or new. So I'm checking.

149
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:36,046
So let me know.

150
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:37,686
Or don't. Whatever.

151
00:09:37,856 --> 00:09:39,483
I'm breezy!

152
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:44,352
You can't say you're breezy.
That negates the breezy.

153
00:09:46,598 --> 00:09:50,125
Hola. It's me.
Yesterday was really fun.

154
00:09:50,301 --> 00:09:52,895
Call me about this weekend, okay?

155
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:57,434
Now, she sounded breezy.

156
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,286
He's seeing someone.
l can't believe he's seeing someone.

157
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:12,014
-You don't know that.
-Well, whose voice was that?

158
00:10:12,223 --> 00:10:15,215
Maybe it was his sister's.
Maybe it was his daughter's.

159
00:10:16,594 --> 00:10:20,587
Michelle. Of course! lt was Michelle.
Did it sound like Michelle?

160
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,994
l cannot remember her.

161
00:10:25,937 --> 00:10:30,237
Great. lt's starting to rain.
That'll make it easier to get a cab.

162
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:31,931
lt was Michelle.

163
00:10:32,177 --> 00:10:33,872
lt was definitely Michelle.

164
00:10:34,145 --> 00:10:38,309
Try Monica's green dress. lf it
doesn't fit, wear my gray silk one.

165
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,279
-Unless l wear it.
-You don't know what you're wearing?

166
00:10:41,452 --> 00:10:44,148
l'm just trying to look nice
for your big night.

167
00:10:44,322 --> 00:10:47,485
Which we have
to leave for in 1 2 minutes.

168
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:49,718
l'll pick something out for you.

169
00:10:49,894 --> 00:10:53,557
-There! There! That looks good.
-Ross, that's a towel!

170
00:10:54,966 --> 00:10:57,696
You will notice that l am fully dressed.

171
00:10:57,869 --> 00:11:01,236
l, in turn, have noticed
that you are not.

172
00:11:01,472 --> 00:11:06,341
So in the words of A.A. Milne,
''Get out of my chair, dill-hole.''

173
00:11:08,746 --> 00:11:10,111
Okay.

174
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:20,417
-What are you doing?
-You said to give you the chair.

175
00:11:20,658 --> 00:11:22,751
You didn't say anything about cushions.

176
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:24,724
They're the essence
of the chair!

177
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:27,490
That's right! l'm taking the essence.

178
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,431
Oh, he'll be back.

179
00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:33,069
Oh, there's nobody in the room.

180
00:11:33,671 --> 00:11:37,368
-l'm sorry, l thought it looked pretty.
-That was a Halloween costume.

181
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:40,942
Unless you would like me to go
as Little Bo Peep.

182
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:44,177
l didn't recognize it
without that inflatable sheep.

183
00:11:44,349 --> 00:11:48,149
Which, by the way, Chandler,
l would like back one of these days.

184
00:11:50,822 --> 00:11:53,416
Rach, good! Listen, isn't this
perfect for me?

185
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:56,149
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.

186
00:11:56,327 --> 00:11:59,626
Of course, not for tonight.
Hi. l'm going to a benefit.

187
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:02,061
Not for tonight?
What are you doing?

188
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:05,498
No, l'm sorry. We didn't mean it.
l love you. Breathe.

189
00:12:06,904 --> 00:12:09,896
We used them as pillows
when we went camping.

190
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:11,097
What?

191
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,543
The sheep.

192
00:12:14,712 --> 00:12:17,613
Hey, what you do on your own time....

193
00:12:21,185 --> 00:12:22,982
Where's my underwear?

194
00:12:23,821 --> 00:12:27,416
-Come on, you took his underwear?
-He took my essence!

195
00:12:27,592 --> 00:12:32,529
Okay, hold on. Why can't you just wear
the underwear you're wearing now?

196
00:12:32,697 --> 00:12:35,359
Because l'm not wearing
any underwear now.

197
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:38,959
Why do you have
to wear underwear tonight?

198
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:40,832
lt's a rented tux, okay?

199
00:12:41,072 --> 00:12:44,508
l'm not gonna go commando
in another man's fatigues.

200
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:50,306
Then somebody's gonna have
to give somebody back his cushions.

201
00:12:50,982 --> 00:12:55,316
Okay. You hide my clothes, l'm gonna
do the exact opposite to you.

202
00:12:57,488 --> 00:13:00,821
What, are you gonna
show me my clothes?

203
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:02,254
Hey, opposite...

204
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:04,489
...is opposite.

205
00:13:06,364 --> 00:13:07,956
He's got nothing!

206
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:10,729
Okay, l'm ready.

207
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:18,870
Rachel didn't have anything
l liked but this ribbon.

208
00:13:19,077 --> 00:13:21,705
l thought, all right,
l'll be political.

209
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:26,341
-What are you supporting?
-Christmas.

210
00:13:27,885 --> 00:13:32,845
Hey, that's okay with me. Two down,
and l have exactly 1 2 minutes--

211
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:35,215
What?

212
00:13:35,593 --> 00:13:37,925
My watch stopped.
My watch. Okay, see...

213
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:41,293
...the dinosaur tail
isn't going around anymore.

214
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:45,897
What time is it? lt's 7:33. l have
seven minutes. l have seven minutes!

215
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,903
Which shoes should l wear?
The black or the purple?

216
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:51,607
-Just pick one, okay?
-Oh, okay, okay. The black.

217
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:54,403
Do you have black
with little strappies?

218
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:58,675
Yeah. But those go better with pants.
Maybe l should wear pants.

219
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:03,787
Yeah, pants! What an idea!
Or better yet, go without pants.

220
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:07,083
l don't know what you're doing,
but just get in there...

221
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:09,826
...and pick out any shoes
that fit your feet.

222
00:14:10,027 --> 00:14:13,485
l don't care if they match.
l don't care if they make...

223
00:14:13,731 --> 00:14:18,361
...your ankles or your knees or your
earlobes look fat. Just do it!

224
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:21,231
Go in there, pick something out
so we can go.

225
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,532
-All right.
-Thank you.

226
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:31,075
l've got to call Michelle to see
if that was her voice.

227
00:14:31,315 --> 00:14:33,249
lt was. lt was her voice.

228
00:14:33,418 --> 00:14:36,478
Monica, l think you've gone over
to the bad place.

229
00:14:40,558 --> 00:14:42,355
Hola.

230
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:45,025
Hello? Hello?

231
00:14:46,397 --> 00:14:49,457
-Okay. That was her, right?
-Definitely. Yeah.

232
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:51,326
So there you go.

233
00:14:51,736 --> 00:14:55,069
We're out of the woods.
l think l'll get dressed now.

234
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:58,370
-l'll get it.
-Okay.

235
00:14:59,644 --> 00:15:01,111
Hi, Monica and Rachel's.

236
00:15:01,612 --> 00:15:04,638
Yeah, just a second.
Can l ask who's calling?

237
00:15:04,849 --> 00:15:06,316
lt's Michelle!

238
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:12,378
She must have that caller lD thing.
You should get that.

239
00:15:15,393 --> 00:15:16,519
Michelle?

240
00:15:17,094 --> 00:15:20,928
Yeah, that was me.
l dialed your number by mistake.

241
00:15:21,165 --> 00:15:22,291
Just try to be--

242
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:25,735
You're so sweet.

243
00:15:26,437 --> 00:15:28,530
Yeah, we were a great couple.

244
00:15:28,706 --> 00:15:30,674
l know, l really miss him.

245
00:15:31,242 --> 00:15:33,904
Well, you know how it is.
lt's just that.....

246
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:35,739
You know what's weird?

247
00:15:37,682 --> 00:15:39,775
Donald Duck never wore pants.

248
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:43,085
But when he gets
out of the shower...

249
00:15:43,321 --> 00:15:45,949
...he always puts a towel
around his waist.

250
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:51,493
l mean, what is that about?

251
00:15:52,497 --> 00:15:57,025
l only beeped in so l could hear my
own message. l mean, that's allowed.

252
00:15:59,704 --> 00:16:04,038
l would really appreciate it if you
wouldn't tell your dad about--

253
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:08,678
What do you mean, you don't feel
comfortable with this? We're friends!

254
00:16:09,914 --> 00:16:11,848
That bitch always hated me.

255
00:16:12,116 --> 00:16:13,481
l'm calling her back.

256
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,483
-Okay, fine.
-Okay.

257
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:22,122
-She's got a phone in there, right?
-Okay, we're on it.

258
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,833
l know it says ''black tie optional'' ...

259
00:16:37,074 --> 00:16:39,736
...but this may be pushing it a little.

260
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:41,804
l'm not gonna go.

261
00:16:43,981 --> 00:16:45,209
You're not gonna go?

262
00:16:45,483 --> 00:16:49,146
No, l think l'm gonna catch up
on my correspondence.

263
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:53,648
How can you not be going?

264
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:55,522
l'm not gonna go.

265
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,491
So l think that will accomplish
the not going.

266
00:17:04,402 --> 00:17:06,893
You know, just out of curiosity--

267
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:10,370
Since l was humiliated
and yelled at in front of my friends...

268
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:15,341
...l'm just, l don't know, not in a
very museum benefity kind of mood.

269
00:17:15,513 --> 00:17:19,506
Right. Well, okay. Okay.
God, l'm sorry. l'm sorry l yelled.

270
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:21,912
-That's fine.
-No, but you're mad.

271
00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:24,120
l'm not mad. l'm just not going.

272
00:17:24,322 --> 00:17:25,812
-Right.
-Okay.

273
00:17:27,124 --> 00:17:30,184
You know that l have to go, right?

274
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:34,865
So is it gonna be, like,
l'm abandoning you while you're upset?

275
00:17:35,032 --> 00:17:36,021
-No.
-No?

276
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:40,397
-You're not upset about the yelling.
-Right. And the humiliating.

277
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:42,698
Well, of course, the humiliating.

278
00:17:44,742 --> 00:17:45,766
So we...

279
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:47,503
...we're okay?

280
00:17:47,745 --> 00:17:49,736
-We're good.
-Right.

281
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,380
-Honey? l love you.
-Yes, Ross.

282
00:17:56,854 --> 00:17:58,719
Get away from the phone!

283
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:03,283
She's just getting dressed now.

284
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:09,763
ls it wrong that l was
totally aroused by that?

285
00:18:17,808 --> 00:18:20,208
Okay, buddy boy, here it is.

286
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:24,445
You hide my clothes,
l'm wearing everything you own.

287
00:18:24,949 --> 00:18:26,576
Oh, my God!

288
00:18:28,219 --> 00:18:32,019
That is so not the opposite
of taking somebody's underwear!

289
00:18:32,189 --> 00:18:33,747
Look at me! l'm Chandler.

290
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,893
Could l be wearing any more clothes?

291
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:40,920
Maybe if l wasn't going commando....

292
00:18:45,936 --> 00:18:48,200
lt's hot with all this stuff on.

293
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:50,999
l better not do any,
l don't know, lunges.

294
00:18:53,744 --> 00:18:56,110
Okay, enough.
Enough with the lunging.

295
00:18:56,347 --> 00:18:58,975
l'm sick of this.
l've had it up to here.

296
00:18:59,216 --> 00:19:01,707
Neither of you can come to the party!

297
00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:03,880
Jeez, what a baby!

298
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:07,622
Way to ruin it.
l was gonna go get dressed.

299
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:10,090
The only person
l cared about getting dressed...

300
00:19:10,327 --> 00:19:12,761
...is the person who's
not even gonna go.

301
00:19:12,997 --> 00:19:14,862
Look, Rach, l'm sorry, okay?

302
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:19,626
Look, l was a jerk, okay?
l'm sorry l yelled. l want you there.

303
00:19:19,804 --> 00:19:21,704
l need you there.

304
00:19:22,606 --> 00:19:26,542
What can l do to show you
how much l want you to be there?

305
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:29,445
You could drink the fat.

306
00:19:32,016 --> 00:19:34,644
Welcome to an adult conversation.

307
00:19:35,052 --> 00:19:37,350
No, no, no.
Now wait a minute. Wait a minute.

308
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:41,455
-That actually sounds interesting.
-What?

309
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,889
l think you should drink the fat.

310
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:54,367
Okay, if that's what it takes to
show you how much you mean to me...

311
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:57,234
...and how much l want you there,
that's what l'll do.

312
00:19:57,408 --> 00:20:00,673
Let me get you another glass.
That's been sitting out.

313
00:20:01,178 --> 00:20:03,442
l think this will be fine.

314
00:20:03,914 --> 00:20:07,008
Okay, vanilla milkshake.
Just a vanilla milkshake...

315
00:20:07,284 --> 00:20:10,082
...with chicken bits floating in it.

316
00:20:13,324 --> 00:20:14,814
Cheers.

317
00:20:14,992 --> 00:20:17,426
No, don't! Okay, okay, l'll go.
l'll go.

318
00:20:17,695 --> 00:20:18,821
You will?

319
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,956
-You were really gonna do that.
-Well, yeah.

320
00:20:24,034 --> 00:20:26,195
You were gonna drink the fat.

321
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,231
Let's see what else he'll do!

322
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:36,444
How about you get changed?
Give him his underwear.

323
00:20:36,647 --> 00:20:39,946
l'll get a cab. l want everyone
downstairs in two minutes.

324
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:41,277
Monica!

325
00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:44,250
Stop it. Stop it!

326
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:50,387
Ross went to get a cab, so we--

327
00:20:50,628 --> 00:20:53,256
What are you doing? No, Monica, no!

328
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:58,034
Hi, this is Richard.

329
00:20:59,904 --> 00:21:02,429
You have three new messages.

330
00:21:03,474 --> 00:21:05,032
Not anymore.

331
00:21:05,743 --> 00:21:07,870
Message erased.

332
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,814
To record your message,
begin speaking at the tone.

333
00:21:14,952 --> 00:21:16,943
Hi, Richard. lt's Monica.

334
00:21:17,188 --> 00:21:20,157
Listen, l did something
kind of crazy tonight.

335
00:21:20,357 --> 00:21:23,292
Maybe l'm getting my period
or something. l don't know.

336
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:29,365
l beeped into your machine and l heard
this message that freaked me out....

337
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:32,832
You know what?
Michelle will tell you the rest.

338
00:21:33,003 --> 00:21:37,565
l'm sorry, okay? And l hope that we
can just forget the whole thing.

339
00:21:40,377 --> 00:21:44,108
Your outgoing message
has now been changed.

340
00:21:45,149 --> 00:21:46,138
Outgoing?

341
00:21:46,383 --> 00:21:49,284
Did that say outgoing?
Not outgoing!

342
00:21:52,489 --> 00:21:54,389
Hi, Richard, it's Monica.

343
00:21:54,658 --> 00:21:57,684
Listen, I did something
kind of crazy tonight.

344
00:21:57,862 --> 00:22:00,490
Maybe I'm getting
my period or something.

345
00:22:00,664 --> 00:22:03,155
-How did you do that?
-l don't know!

346
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,834
-Goodbye.
-No!

347
00:22:07,504 --> 00:22:12,840
Okay. Okay. Okay, l've got two
cabs and no people! Go, go, go!

348
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,173
Maybe we can call the phone company
to change the message?

349
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:17,710
They could change his number.

350
00:22:17,915 --> 00:22:21,578
l think after this,
he'll be doing that himself.

351
00:22:22,953 --> 00:22:23,977
Rachel!

352
00:22:29,894 --> 00:22:32,522
You....
You look....

353
00:22:35,032 --> 00:22:38,160
And l still have about
five seconds to spare.

354
00:22:44,174 --> 00:22:47,837
-That was about seven seconds.
-So we're a little late.

355
00:22:48,012 --> 00:22:49,741
Come on.

356
00:22:50,748 --> 00:22:53,683
-Oh, and by the way....
-What?

357
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:56,851
l'm going commando too.

358
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:10,127
So l said, ''Who are you
Cro-Magnum P.l.?''

359
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:13,328
Dr. Geller?

360
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:18,237
-Sherman Whitfield, London lnstitute.
-What a pleasure.

361
00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:23,039
l was quite impressed with your
paper on pre-Cretaceous fossils.

362
00:23:23,213 --> 00:23:25,773
Yes. lt confirmed everything
l'd written.

363
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,212
Excuse me.

364
00:23:27,384 --> 00:23:28,578
Hi.

365
00:23:28,752 --> 00:23:30,083
Yes?

366
00:23:30,254 --> 00:23:33,246
Well, you're kind of sitting in my seat.

367
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,117
What do you mean, your seat?

368
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:38,527
-l mean, l was sitting there.
-But you got up.

369
00:23:38,762 --> 00:23:40,923
But l never left the room.

370
00:23:41,632 --> 00:23:43,998
But you left the chair area.

371
00:23:45,502 --> 00:23:47,629
That's it.
Give me your underwear.

372
00:23:51,308 --> 00:23:52,297
