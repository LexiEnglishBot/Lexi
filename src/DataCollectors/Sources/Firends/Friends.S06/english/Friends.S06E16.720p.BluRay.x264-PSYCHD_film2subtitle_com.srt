1
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,177
So, honey, this, uh...

2
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:56,180
This threesome thing? Uh, heh.

3
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,058
How are we even gonna find...?

4
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,020
Actually, I'm making a list of women
I know who might be into this.

5
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,733
Oh. Wow.

6
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,652
Huh.

7
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,822
Boy.

8
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,285
Well, someone's been
doing their homework.

9
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,330
Yeah. Oh, and I know Gail Rosten
is in there twice...

10
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,956
...but she is so...

11
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,375
Oh, I know. Ha, ha.

12
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:30,964
You know, just talking about it
is getting me kind of...

13
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,258
- I know. Me too.
- Yeah?

14
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,885
I think Ben's asleep.

15
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,721
Oh, um...

16
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:42,768
You know, I think it'll be
better if we just save it.

17
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,978
Yeah. Heh.

18
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,273
Right. Save it. I can do that.

19
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,326
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

20
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,577
How's it going?

21
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:04,832
I've got to get out of this bed.
I'm going crazy here! Crazy!

22
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,250
Here you go, sweetie.

23
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,503
What the hell is this, herbal tea?
I hate herbal tea.

24
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,549
- I put some honey in it.
- Nyeh nyeh honey nyeh nyeh.

25
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,972
- She doesn't know she was fired?
- No, the doctors say it may kill her.

26
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,142
What are you two girls
whispering about over there?

27
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,854
But I think we should tell her.

28
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,444
Ugh, I mean, it's just so realistic.

29
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,488
I know. Yeah.

30
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,741
- His name's Pat.
- Pat the dog.

31
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:43,370
Oh! Oh! I get it! Ha, ha!

32
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,789
Oh, God.

33
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,751
You, uh? You...

34
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,297
...ready for a refill?
- Oh, I probably shouldn't.

35
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,048
- Oh.
- So I will! Ha.

36
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,303
Oh!

37
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,971
Wow.

38
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,557
- It's like it's raining.
- Pretty cool, huh?

39
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:07,019
But if you think a fish wouldn't get
sucked into the mechanism...

40
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,062
...well, you'd be wrong.

41
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,900
Um, can I use your bathroom?

42
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:17,237
- It's, uh, right through there.
- Okay. Ah.

43
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,281
You know, I gotta tell you.

44
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,366
If someone told me a week ago...

45
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:25,078
...that I would be peeing
in Joey Tribbiani's apartment...

46
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,748
Life's pretty great, isn't it?

47
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,585
I hope you're hungry.

48
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,837
We're starting with oysters.

49
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,174
You know what they say about oysters,
don't you?

50
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,468
They have parasites?

51
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,054
No. Ha, ha.

52
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,934
Um, well, some people say
that oysters are an aphrodisiac.

53
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,728
- What people?
- People.

54
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,647
People say it.

55
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,316
Come here.

56
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:00,447
- So, oysters, huh?
- Ha-ha-ha.

57
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,408
And then we're gonna have a little
Middle Eastern couscous.

58
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,993
Something we can eat...

59
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,246
...with our hands.

60
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,665
When we were studying
communicable diseases...

61
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,917
No, no, no.

62
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,293
It's sensual.

63
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,171
- Oh. Didn't know. Okay.
- Okay.

64
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,466
Oh, no!

65
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,510
I'm sorry, it's the hospital.

66
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,096
The food looks great.
Save me some?

67
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,431
I can't promise anything.

68
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,859
We're really gonna do this, huh?

69
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,154
Looks like it.

70
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,784
If this is too weird for you,
you can still back out...

71
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,413
- I got it!
- Okay.

72
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,749
- Susan, hi.
- Hey.

73
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,254
- Thank you so much for coming.
- I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

74
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,717
I'm Ross, by the way.

75
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,719
Hello, Ross.

76
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:08,640
- I love what you've done with this space.
- Thank you so much. Heh.

77
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,313
How hot is this?

78
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,154
I'm sorry you're here with me
instead of Roger.

79
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,530
Yeah, me too.

80
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,868
Well, I could make it seem
like he's here.

81
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,496
"Here's some little-known facts
about couscous:

82
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:36,376
They didn't add the second 'cous'
until 1979."

83
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,466
- Stop it! That's not funny!
- Okay.

84
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,384
I'm sorry, okay? It's just...

85
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:48,055
...tonight was supposed to be,
you know, a big deal.

86
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:51,058
- What was tonight?
- You don't want to know what tonight was.

87
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,768
Okay.

88
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,520
What was tonight?

89
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,401
Tonight was going to be my first time.

90
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,070
With Roger?

91
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,367
Not just with Roger? Oh, my God.

92
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,620
All right, relax,
Mr. I've-Had-Sex-Four-Times!

93
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,333
Four different women!

94
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,835
I've had sex way more times.

95
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,629
How many?

96
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,631
Nine.

97
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,135
I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.

98
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,889
Well, good. Good for you.
You really think Roger's the perfect guy?

99
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,601
No, but he's not a horrible guy.

100
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,853
That's what I tell girls about me.

101
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,023
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!

102
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,901
No, you're not.
You are sweet and wonderful...

103
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,903
...and this is gonna happen for you.

104
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,823
Oh, really? When?
Do you want to do it with me?

105
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,366
Okay.

106
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,871
I was kidding.

107
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,915
So was I.

108
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,506
Joey.

109
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,467
You're such an amazing actor.

110
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:12,431
How do you know where
Dr. Drake Ramoray leaves off...

111
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,100
...and Joey Tribbiani begins?

112
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,645
Well, with Dr. Drake...

113
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,606
...they always tell me what to say.

114
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:28,113
And with Joey, I pretty much have to
make it up on my own.

115
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,574
- Wow.
- Mm.

116
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,868
Tell me something. Whoa!

117
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,748
- I just fell right off the couch there.
- Yeah, you did.

118
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm okay.

119
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,920
- Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
- Whoops. Yeah.

120
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,631
When was the last time...

121
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,509
...someone told you
just how beautiful you are?

122
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,053
Wow.

123
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,264
I can't feel my hands.

124
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,559
Come on. Come here.

125
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,106
- Huh?
- Huh.

126
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,983
- Oh?
- Ooh.

127
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,341
- We can't do this.
- No!

128
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,136
- Oyster?
- Yeah.

129
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,934
If... if! If we did do this,
there'd be a lot of pressure on me.

130
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:43,522
Because you've waited a long time,
and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.

131
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,565
But I have nothing to compare it to.

132
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,401
So even if you were horrible,
how would I know?

133
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,821
I do like that.

134
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,200
It's harder for me.
I have four women to compete with.

135
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,702
Well, if it helps, there were only three.

136
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,248
So it'd just be for tonight?

137
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:04,793
Absolutely. It would just be one
friend helping out another friend.

138
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,420
Stop it. We're not doing this.

139
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,880
- Let's do it!
- No!

140
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,091
- Okay!
- Okay!

141
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,593
So, um...

142
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,929
Do you have any, uh, moves?

143
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,184
I have some moves.

144
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,396
- I have no moves.
- Okay.

145
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,191
Oh, okay, what you doing there?

146
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,070
- I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
- Yeah, forget it.

147
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,864
- What if I turn out the lights?
- Okay.

148
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,538
Oh, yeah.

149
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,083
- Chandler?
- Yeah?

150
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,169
That's the couch.

151
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,176
Oh, my God!

152
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,096
I know!

153
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,640
I'll tell you something.

154
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,768
We are gonna do that again!

155
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,397
- Oh, okay!
- Ah!

156
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,992
Morning.

157
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,954
- Oh, right.
- Yeah.

158
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,624
Oh, God.

159
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:30,629
Oh, I can't believe Joey Tribbiani
heard me throw up.

160
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,506
He actually saw you a little bit too.

161
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,966
No.

162
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,637
Oh, God, we... We didn't, uh?

163
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,639
No. No, no.

164
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,183
Not after seeing that.

165
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,145
God, I'm just a horrible person.

166
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,981
- Well, why?
- Because I'm married.

167
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,025
That's right, I'm a married woman.

168
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,612
I came to a TV star's apartment
to have an affair. Ugh!

169
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,406
That's ridiculous.

170
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,451
I'm not a "star."

171
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:05,121
I'm just a regular famous actor.

172
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,334
And I'm a horrible, horrible person.

173
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,170
Rachel, will you stop saying that?

174
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,588
Hey. Hey, look.

175
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,717
Remember on the show
when Capri was dying?

176
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,303
- And she gave me...
- The ring from the cave. Yeah.

177
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,596
Wow.

178
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,473
Uh, okay, well...

179
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,183
Uh...

180
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,189
Oh, my God!
They let you keep that stuff?

181
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,485
Sure. As long as they don't find out,
you can keep whatever you want.

182
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,570
And I want you to have it.

183
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,489
- No, I couldn't.
- Yes. Yes.

184
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,366
And every time you look at it...

185
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,161
...I want you to remember
that you are a good person.

186
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,539
Now, you had the chance to cheat...

187
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,166
...and with me.

188
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:55,714
But you didn't.
And that's what this ring stands for.

189
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,801
But I thought that ring stood for
Capri's undying love for her brother.

190
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,262
- Look, you want the ring or not?
- Yeah!

191
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,769
Hey, look at you! You're up!

192
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,272
- All right.
- I thought I'd try to take a walk.

193
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,482
You pour me some water.
I'll be back soon.

194
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,402
Whoa, whoa.
You're not gonna call work, are you?

195
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,529
No. I've learned my lesson.

196
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,327
Let's go. Come on. Move it.

197
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,079
Phoebe, come on!

198
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,958
Shoes, briefcase. Thanks, Lou.
Good luck with the gallbladder.

199
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,341
Hey, Joe...

200
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,427
...did you ever have a threesome?

201
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:49,601
Look, Ross. Carol's great, and I'm sure
you're a very attractive man, but...

202
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,060
No, I...

203
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,773
No. The reason I'm asking is that...

204
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,611
...I sort of had one last night.

205
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,196
- You?
- Yeah.

206
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,239
- Wow. All right.
- Yeah.

207
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,366
So? Was it amazing?

208
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,035
It was, heh...

209
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,536
...okay.

210
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,415
Just okay? Did you do it right?

211
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:17,712
Look, it's just, did you ever
go to a party and think:

212
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,925
"Would anyone really miss me
if I weren't here?"

213
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,136
Huh.

214
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,555
But still, Ross.

215
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:31,434
Your worst day with two women,
pretty much better than any other day.

216
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,269
Oh, oh, no, absolutely.

217
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,815
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

218
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,943
It's just...

219
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,738
...my part seemed to be over
pretty quickly...

220
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,449
...and then there was
a lot of waiting around.

221
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,618
Oh.

222
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,954
But you got to be with
both of them, right?

223
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,915
Not really.

224
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,210
Eh, just Carol.

225
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,463
- Not the other one?
- No, she kept kicking me away.

226
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,632
- You don't want that.
- No.

227
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,511
Hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff.

228
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,181
Oh, I saw a lot of stuff.

229
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,977
- You get a little bored?
- A little.

230
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,146
- Yeah. Made a snack.
- Yeah?

231
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,568
- What'd you have?
- Just a sandwich.

232
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,821
Turkey. A little mustard.

233
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,031
- Sounds good.
- It really was.

234
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,912
- Hey.
- Hey.

235
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,166
Let me tell you about this chick
I scored with last night.

236
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,379
- Oh, no, wait a minute, that was you.
- Heh.

237
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,716
Hey, check me out. I'm a slut!

238
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,262
So you, uh,
want to do something tonight?

239
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,764
Oh, I can't.
Dr. Roger's coming over again.

240
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,643
Oh. Oh, right.

241
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:59,230
Right. Because you're still seeing him,
and, uh, he's a good guy.

242
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,523
I remember a time...

243
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,321
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, totally.

244
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,488
Totally. Are you?

245
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,574
Great. It's so amazing.

246
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,077
Last time Dr. Roger came over,
I was so nervous.

247
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:17,457
But after being with you,
I'm like, "Can the doctor see me now?"

248
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,375
I'll bet he can.

249
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:23,212
"I don't have an appointment,
but I sure could use a physical." Ha, ha.

250
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:31,137
- You sure you're okay?
- Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.

251
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,522
Aah!

252
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,567
My God! Barry!

253
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,987
- You said you'd be away all weekend!
- Oh!

254
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,115
That's right, I'm sorry. I am early!

255
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,243
Finish, please!

256
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,627
Surprise, look who's back.

257
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,462
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

258
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,339
Call security.

259
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,300
Pheebs, uh, didn't you get fired?

260
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,969
Heh, I don't think so.

261
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,889
- Phoebe?
- Jack! Hey. Ha, ha.

262
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,725
- What are you doing here?
- All better. Back to work.

263
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,103
This clown from research
told me I was fired.

264
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,480
He should do his research, huh?
Ha-ha-ha.

265
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,692
Well, you were fired.

266
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,194
Nuh-uh.

267
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,488
I told that guy
who answered your phone.

268
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,908
Oh, okay. I didn't get that message.
So this doesn't count.

269
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,244
- Anyway, I'll be in my office.
- Ah, heh.

270
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,746
Phoebe, you don't have an office.

271
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,249
All right, I'll work right here.

272
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,835
This is good. Next to this plant.

273
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,755
- Phoebe, let's...
- You're in my office.

274
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:53,386
Look, I've made a lot of cash for this
company. I am talking big bucks!

275
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:57,181
Pesos! Yen! Rubles!
You make one little mistake...

276
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,308
You lost 13 million dollars.

277
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,394
So now this is all about money?

278
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,981
You know, it's bad enough that...
Ow!

279
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,316
Oh, you have got to be kidding.

280
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,820
- Are you all right?
- I'm having another heart attack.

281
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,990
- What?
- I'm having another heart attack!

282
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,617
Call 911!

283
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,578
Dumb-ass!

284
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,373
Pheebs, how's it going?

285
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,043
They fired me,
and I'm having a heart attack.

286
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,503
- Well, welcome back.
- Yeah.

287
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,717
- Hi, Ross.
- Hi, Rachel.

288
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,678
- Is Joey Tribbiani here?
- Um, no.

289
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:39,348
If you see him, please tell him
that I'm looking for him...

290
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:43,478
...and that this time
I am not gonna throw up!

291
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,482
- Are you okay?
- Me? I'm great!

292
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,318
I'm fine! I'm so good.

293
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,154
But you know who's not great?

294
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,530
Men!

295
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,240
- You're a man, right, Ross?
- Yeah.

296
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,159
- Sit down.
- Okay.

297
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,370
Let me, uh, ask you something.

298
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,792
Do wedding vows mean squat
to you people?

299
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,254
Why is it that the second
we go out of town...

300
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:14,008
...bam, there you are in bed
with the neighbor's dog-walker?

301
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,305
We're sorry.

302
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:25,269
No, seriously. Seriously. What has
happened to the sanctity of marriage?

303
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,399
- Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
- Oh, what are you, a detective?

304
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,613
I don't know what's going on
with you and your husband...

305
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,407
...and what is hopefully
an adult dog-walker.

306
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,371
Look, can I just say,
not all men are like that.

307
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,039
- Ugh.
- Hey, there are some men...

308
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,750
...who'll do whatever
to make their marriage work.

309
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,461
There are some men
who will stand by and watch...

310
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:55,258
...as their wives engage in what can
only be described as a "twosome"...

311
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,928
...with some woman she barely knows
from the gym!

312
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,140
Who are these men?

313
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,725
Just men. A guy I know.

314
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:08,729
Well, you might want to tell him
it sounds like his wife...

315
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,065
...is gay.

316
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,984
She is not...

317
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,532
She's gay.

318
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,870
Oh, my God.

319
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,957
She is so gay!

320
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,963
I can't believe this.

321
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,049
Good day for married people, huh?

322
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,888
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.

323
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,599
I'm sorry your wife is gay.

324
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,563
- I guess women aren't that great either.
- Try telling my wife that.

325
00:19:56,653 --> 00:20:00,156
- Okay to come in?
- Yeah, come in, eat, whatever you want.

326
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,366
Dr. Roger got beeped again.

327
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,994
Yeah, I know. Guess who beeped him?

328
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,291
- What?
- I'm the ruptured spleen. Ha, ha!

329
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,504
- Why would you do that?
- Because you shouldn't be with him.

330
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,676
You should be with me.

331
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,306
- Really?
- When you were talking about Roger...

332
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,892
...that was killing me. Look.

333
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,394
Things like last night don't just happen.

334
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:34,732
At least not to me. I mean,
with the other two women...

335
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:40,863
...in the morning, I couldn't wait
to just go hang out with my friends.

336
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,407
But with you...

337
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:48,287
...heh, I was, you know,
already with a friend.

338
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:52,708
- Chandler.
- You probably don't want to go out with me.

339
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:56,587
I make too many jokes,
I've never been in a serious relationship...

340
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,423
...and I guess I'm not
technically a "doctor."

341
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,892
There was just one woman,
wasn't there?

342
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,270
No, there were two.

343
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,355
- Including me?
- Oh, yeah.

344
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:25,074
It only takes two heart attacks
To finally make you see

345
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:30,329
One of them won't do it
But the second will set you free

346
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:37,586
Tell all your hate and anger
It's time to say goodbye

347
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,214
And that is just what I will do

348
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,175
Soon as those bastards I worked for die

349
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:50,558
La, la-la la, la la la la la la
La la la, la la la-la-la la
