1
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:07,172
Listen, you know what? Sir, for the last time,
I don't care what the computer says.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,801
We did not take a bag
of Meshugga Nuts from the minibar.

3
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:14,763
And we did not watch
Dr. Do-Me-A-Little.

4
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,641
- Hey.
- Oh.

5
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:21,478
- Joey, were you in our room last night?
- No.

6
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,614
I was told the name of the movie
would not appear on the bill.

7
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:38,954
- Hi, we're checking out of the bridal suite.
- That's right, I'm no longer a bride.

8
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:43,208
I'll never be a bride again.
Now I'm just someone's wife.

9
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,087
And I'm the happiest guy
in the world.

10
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:52,051
Come on, honey. Don't be upset.
We have so much to look forward to.

11
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,886
Yeah, right.

12
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,972
- The honeymoon.
- That's not till Thursday.

13
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,767
- The wedding pictures.
- Those won't be ready weeks.

14
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:05,773
- Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
- That's true! I knew I married you for a reason!

15
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:10,027
I'll tell you what. I will go get them developed,
and you can go home.

16
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:18,577
- What? What did you take a picture of?
- Nothing. It was something.

17
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,331
Okay, Ross has the cameras.
Is he checked out yet?

18
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,667
Are you joking?
Checkout is not till noon.

19
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:30,172
- And he has a good 11 minutes left.
- So?

20
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,550
So Ross has never checked out of a room
a minute before he had to.

21
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,469
Yeah, one time when we were dating...

22
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:40,057
...we got a late checkout, he got so excited,
it was the best sex we ever had.

23
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,852
Until he screamed out "Radisson"
at the end.

24
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,816
Okay, I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras,
and get them developed.

25
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,363
Thirty-two, Joe. You're 32!

26
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,284
- Here's a copy of your bill.
- Oh, thanks.

27
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,704
Champagne, strawberries...

28
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:08,544
Oh, my God! I can't believe Chandler
ordered porn on our wedding night.

29
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,464
Yeah, that's sad.

30
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,383
Meshugga Nut?

31
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,384
- Hi.
- Hi.

32
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:02,139
Soaps, shampoos.
Are you really taking all this stuff?

33
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:07,853
- Why not? It's built into the price of the room.
- Yeah, but you don't need...

34
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,106
- What is this?
- Thread.

35
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,109
Score!

36
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:18,488
- Where are the disposable cameras?
- What disposable cameras?

37
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,699
Last night I asked you to take them.

38
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:25,037
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, before we cut the cake, I said...

39
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,956
Yeah, you came up to me
and asked me for a favor.

40
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,001
And then my Uncle Murray came up to you
and handed you a check.

41
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:34,963
Then you said, "Why do they call it a check?
Why not a Yugoslavian?"

42
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:43,388
- Yeah, then you did that.
- So you don't have the cameras?

43
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,307
- No, sorry.
- So what? What?

44
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,810
- They're gone? Monica's gonna freak!
- I'm sure they're here somewhere.

45
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,437
I'll help you look.

46
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,981
- Great.
- In three minutes.

47
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,415
- Hey
- Hey.

48
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,752
Are you gonna open the presents
without Chandler?

49
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,337
No.

50
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,467
They're calling out to me.

51
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,637
This little guy even crawled
up in my lap.

52
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,682
Come on, Chandler wouldn't mind
if I opened just one present.

53
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,975
What do you think it is?

54
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,189
A mirror that when you look into it,
you see yourself as an old woman.

55
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,361
A tiny salt shaker!

56
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,407
Oh, my God, for tiny salt!

57
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,368
Oh, wow! Okay, that was fun.

58
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,577
Oh, yeah.

59
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,539
I'm just gonna wait for Chandler
to open up the rest of them.

60
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,499
- Okay.
- Whoo!

61
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:58,588
Although, you know, this is part
of a salt-and-pepper set.

62
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,009
So I guess it may just count as half a present.
What do you think?

63
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:06,596
Well, I guess it's okay to open one more
if it's part of a set. It's probably this one.

64
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,682
Or this one!

65
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:11,977
Hi.

66
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:16,356
- How you feeling? Got any morning sickness?
- Shh! The guys don't know yet, do they?

67
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:20,152
No. Joey and Ross don't know anything,
and Chandler thinks Phoebe's pregnant.

68
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,363
That's right.
Chandler does still think I'm pregnant.

69
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:27,534
He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling,
or offered to carry my bags.

70
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,287
I feel bad for the woman
who ends up with him.

71
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,292
After you, of course.

72
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:39,254
Don't worry. I promise that you will only have
to be pregnant a few more hours.

73
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,089
I'm going to tell the father today.

74
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,301
Is it someone in this building?
That tall guy from the first floor?

75
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,180
- Eww! No!
- What? I think he's cute.

76
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,683
- Well, then you have his baby.
- Believe me, I'm trying.

77
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,438
Wow. It's so weird.
You're gonna tell this guy today...

78
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,107
...and he has no idea
what's gonna happen.

79
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:04,112
Yeah. You're just gonna knock on his door
and change his life forever.

80
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,783
You're like Ed McMahon,
except without the big check.

81
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,660
Or the raw sexual magnetism.

82
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:17,459
- Yeah, I guess it is pretty big news.
- Pretty big? It's huge!

83
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:21,004
God, this guy doesn't have a clue.
He's walking around thinking:

84
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,799
"I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!"

85
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,011
Then, bam!
He's a father, everything's different.

86
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:32,349
Well, it's only different if he wants it to be.
I'm not gonna ask him for anything.

87
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,602
Then he still has this huge decision
to make. Now he's thinking:

88
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,772
"Do I want to be a dad?"
Then, bam!

89
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:43,610
- What was that "bam"?
- I don't know. He's hit by a bus.

90
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,656
- Hi.
- Hey.

91
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:52,452
Joey, what would you do if someone
you slept with told you she was pregnant?

92
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,001
Who called here?

93
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:06,425
Did she sound blond? Any accent?
I gotta make a call.

94
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,844
Should have never walked
into that Sunglass Hut!

95
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:12,848
Oh, Joey! Joey! It's not you!
You didn't get anyone pregnant.

96
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,769
Why would you scare me like that?
What the hell's going on?

97
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,232
Is somebody pregnant?

98
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,986
Oh, yeah! That's me.

99
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:31,366
Oh, my God, Pheebs!
You're gonna have a baby?

100
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,201
Yes, I am.

101
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,246
Oh, my God, I'm gonna have a baby!

102
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:41,042
- Wait, who's the father?
- You don't know him.

103
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:45,046
He wants nothing to do
with me or the baby.

104
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:53,472
Who is this guy? Who is he?
Because I'll track him down and kick his ass!

105
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,057
- David Linn.
- David Linn!

106
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,227
David Linn! David Linn!

107
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:04,441
- Who's David Linn?
- Some guy from my gym. A little annoying.

108
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:13,241
- Chandler?
- Hey. Did you find the cameras?

109
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,659
No. Did you?

110
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:18,288
Yes, that's why I'm under the table.
Celebrating.

111
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,208
I checked in the lost and found.

112
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,627
I talked to the manager.
No one's turned them in.

113
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:28,632
Great. Those cameras were the only thing
that will cheer Monica up. She's depressed.

114
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,593
You guys just got married.
Why is she so depressed?

115
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:35,347
All my energy is going into
not asking that question.

116
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:40,352
- I can't believe I screwed this up!
- I'm sorry, man.

117
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,566
Here's a thought.
This is the same ballroom.

118
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:50,278
There's a band. There's gonna be
plenty of dressed up people.

119
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,615
Are you suggesting
we dance our troubles away?

120
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:59,871
No, we buy more of these at the gift shop,
throw our tuxes on and take a few pictures.

121
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,749
All have to do is make sure
not to get people's faces.

122
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,626
Are you serious?

123
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,212
I'm just thinking about your new bride.

124
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,757
Okay? Do you really want to start your
life together by letting her down?

125
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,135
Marriage advice? Really?

126
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,682
I'm telling you,
this looks exactly like your wedding.

127
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,310
- Aren't these the same flowers?
- I don't know. Monica picked them.

128
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,813
- The chairs?
- Those too.

129
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,773
- The place settings?
- Her.

130
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,026
- What did you do?
- I was in charge of the cameras.

131
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,195
- Gift shop?
- Mm.

132
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,576
Hey.

133
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:41,121
- Did you do it yet?
- Not yet.

134
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,041
Then what are you doing here?
Are you about to do it?

135
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,419
- Is it Gunther?
- No...

136
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:53,383
- It's not Gunther!
- Thank God. That hair on a baby?

137
00:09:54,969 --> 00:10:00,599
The father is not here. I haven't
told him, and I don't think I can now.

138
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,726
- Why not?
- Now let me think.

139
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:08,023
I was walking down the street, thinking, "I'm
gonna tell the father today." And then, bam!

140
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,483
Bus?

141
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:16,865
No, you! You freaked me out.
You kept saying how huge this all is.

142
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,117
- But it is huge.
- I know.

143
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,203
But I was just thinking
about how huge it was for me.

144
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,040
I didn't go to how huge
this is gonna be for the father.

145
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,584
You're thinking about this
way too much.

146
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,003
Just tell him and get it over with.

147
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:34,257
It's like ripping off this Band-Aid,
quick and painless. Watch.

148
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,551
Oh, mother of...!

149
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,597
See?

150
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:50,982
- Ooh. Are we opening presents?
- No. I shouldn't have even opened these.

151
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,735
Joey, I am out of control!

152
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,196
You have to do me a favor.

153
00:10:56,364 --> 00:11:01,117
No matter what I say, no matter what I do,
please do not let me open another present.

154
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,286
- Okay?
- Okay.

155
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,415
- Give me one more.
- Okay.

156
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:14,422
- Hey.
- Oh, good. You're here. Pheebs? Listen...

157
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:18,426
- Sit down, I got something I want to say.
- All right.

158
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,431
Um...

159
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:29,270
It's a scary world out there,
especially for a single mom.

160
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:34,693
Now, I always felt that you
and I have a special bond.

161
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,282
So, Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

162
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,288
Oh, my God!

163
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,418
- Joey!
- Oh, yeah, I'll marry you.

164
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:57,841
- You can't marry him!
- Hey, lady, your day's over, it's my turn.

165
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,593
- Phoebe!
- What? Why can't she marry me?

166
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,346
I can and I will.

167
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:08,643
She's not pregnant. It's Rachel.
Rachel's the one who's pregnant, okay.

168
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,312
- Oh, my God!
- Hey.

169
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,232
He'd notice when you didn't
have a baby in nine months!

170
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,818
It's Joey!

171
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,862
I love you.

172
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,867
I can't believe it! Rachel's pregnant?

173
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,869
- Yeah.
- Who's the father?

174
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,996
We don't know.

175
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,001
- I wonder if it's that dude.
- There's a dude?

176
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,044
- Yeah.
- Who is it?

177
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:41,217
A month ago this guy spent the night.
I didn't see who it was, but...

178
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,641
Was that story over?

179
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,773
The guy left this.

180
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,194
Oh, my God!
I know who the father is.

181
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,367
People have got
to finish their stories.

182
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,753
- Excuse me. Could you take a picture of us?
- Oh. Of course.

183
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:26,221
- Would you take one of us?
- Uh. Yeah, sure.

184
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,264
Click.

185
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,893
- It didn't click.
- I heard it.

186
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,563
- But there was no flash.
- Why won't you take our picture?

187
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,316
Yeah, I'll take your picture.

188
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:45,406
- Your finger was covering the lens.
- Who are you, Ansel Adams? Get out of here!

189
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,748
Look, I feel really bad about how
I freaked you out before...

190
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,960
...so I called the father
and asked him to meet you here. Go!

191
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:01,172
What? Wait a minute.
How do you even know who the father is?

192
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,759
I may play the fool at times...

193
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:09,430
...but I'm more than a pretty blond
with an ass that won't quit.

194
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,602
I believe this belongs to the father
of your baby.

195
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,563
Oh, God.

196
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,816
- Oh. He's in there right now?
- Uh-huh.

197
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:24,529
You can turn around, or you can go in there
and rip the Band-Aid off.

198
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,947
What do you wanna do?

199
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,617
- Let's rip.
- Really? Are you sure?

200
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,161
- Phoebe!
- Okay. Sorry. Yeah.

201
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,624
Hey, Rach.

202
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,551
Go on-stage. I'll get a picture
of you doing the speech.

203
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,052
Okay. Okay.

204
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:09,741
Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre
please see the front desk?

205
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,493
Your car is about to be towed.

206
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,582
That's my car!

207
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,252
- A '95 LeSabre?
- Yes.

208
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,213
- A green LeSabre?
- Yes!

209
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,803
- I'm sorry, I meant blue.
- Yes, green-blue.

210
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,643
Well, go. Go move it!

211
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,688
- Okay. Ready for the last picture?
- Yeah.

212
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,106
Get ready to run.

213
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,406
Congratulations on your wedding.

214
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,790
So, what's this about?

215
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,626
Rachel has something
that she wants to tell you.

216
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,922
And I believe that
this is your red sweater.

217
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,218
No, this is my red sweater.

218
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,305
Oh, no.

219
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,560
Could I get anyone a coffee?

220
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,940
Or poison? No? Just for me? Okay.

221
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,235
What's going on?

222
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:31,489
Nothing.
Phoebe kind of made a mistake.

223
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:36,494
But you do wear that sweater a lot.
Are you involved in some kind of dare?

224
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,331
I'm actually glad Phoebe called.

225
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,756
I know we broke up because you thought
I wasn't mature enough...

226
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,468
...but I've really grown up.
And I think we should get back together.

227
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,804
It's just not the right time.

228
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,640
- It is the right time.
- Okay.

229
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,809
- I'm ready for more.
- Tag.

230
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,311
Come on, Rach.
Let's give it another try.

231
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,024
- I'm having a baby.
- Oh.

232
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,451
- You can go.
- Thank you.

233
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,833
I don't know how
any of these got opened!

234
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:29,547
- You opened them all?
- I know, I am a terrible person.

235
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,675
Chandler's never gonna trust me
with anything ever again.

236
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:37,221
- Hey! You got my parents' gift.
- Yeah. What is that?

237
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,475
I don't know.
I think it does something to salami.

238
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,230
- Hey. How'd it go?
- Yeah. What did Tag say?

239
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,650
Tag is not the father.
And Joey knows now?

240
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,905
I do, Rach. I do.
And I'm so happy for you.

241
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:00,119
Oh. Wow, you didn't even try
to unhook my bra.

242
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,166
So are you ever gonna tell
whoever it is?

243
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,086
I will, I'm just not up for it tonight.

244
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:12,131
Hey, Rach, listen. No matter what he says,
you're not gonna be alone.

245
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,716
- I'm not?
- No.

246
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,719
Listen, I, uh...

247
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:22,683
It's a scary world out there,
especially for a single mom.

248
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:23,893
Aww.

249
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:28,064
I've always felt like
you and I have this special bond.

250
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,110
- Rachel Green, will you marry me?
- What?

251
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,903
- What?
- What?!

252
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,032
- Pheebs, give me the ring back.
- No!

253
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,495
Joey, you're so sweet.
You are so, so sweet, honey.

254
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,789
But I'm not looking for a husband.

255
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,419
I understand.

256
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:55,716
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go and lie down.

257
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,349
I can't say that didn't hurt.

258
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:09,939
- But I'll take you back, Joey.
- About that, I...

259
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,359
- Ohh, a Salami Buddy!
- There you go!

260
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,404
- We're back!
- Great.

261
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:20,032
We're hanging in the kitchen.
Let's stay in the kitchen.

262
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:24,537
- It's picture time.
- You're gonna love these.

263
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,581
Here's a picture of Ross.

264
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,375
And that's me.

265
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,129
And that's me and Ross.

266
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:38,509
Aww. And here's our first kiss
as a married couple.

267
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,554
Wow. That is a great picture.

268
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:46,100
Yeah. And interesting, because I found
the cameras in one of our bags.

269
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,273
Huh. Didn't see that coming.

270
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,568
Okay, so this isn't
the picture of our first kiss...

271
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:59,822
...but it is a picture of my first kiss
with this lady.

272
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:06,829
Which, by the look on your face, I'm sure
you'll remember, so there's no need...

273
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,249
I'll take the real pictures
to them developed.

274
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,543
- That'd be a good idea.
- Okay.

275
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,593
You opened all the presents without me?
We were gonna do that together.

276
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,012
You kissed another woman?

277
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,307
- Call it even?
- Okay.

278
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:37,318
- Well, I'm gonna go get these in some water.
- You stole those from that wedding?

279
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:41,989
No, the hotel lobby. They think
they can charge me for some dirty movie...

280
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:45,743
...and a bag of Meshugga Nuts
they got another thing coming!

281
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,123
Hey, my sweater!

282
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,004
I've been looking for this for like a month.

283
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,719
Oh, my God!

284
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,395
Oh, my God!

285
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:23,447
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good. Long time no see.

286
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,827
- Like your sweater.
- Oh. Hey. Right back at you.

287
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:35,418
- It's crazy about Rachel.
- Yeah. Well, she's one crazy lady.

288
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:41,173
- So whose is it?
- Um, I don't know, some Italian guy.

289
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:46,053
Come on, read your own label.
See you later.

290
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,931
- Okay.
- He is so weird.
