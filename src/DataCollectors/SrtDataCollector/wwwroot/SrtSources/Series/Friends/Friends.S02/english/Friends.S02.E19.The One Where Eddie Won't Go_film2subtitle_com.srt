2
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:09,883
Hey, Eddie. Aah!

3
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,388
- What are you doing here?
- Watching you sleep.

4
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,349
Why?

5
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,560
It makes me feel, um, peaceful.

6
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,395
Ha, ha. Ahem. Please.

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,522
I can't sleep now!

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,898
Oh, you want me to sing?

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,526
No. Look.

10
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:31,030
That's it. I want you
out of the apartment now!

11
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,282
Oh, what are you talking about?

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,825
Hannibal Lecter?

13
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,619
Better roommate than you.

14
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:38,829
No.

15
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:42,875
I don't think you're being fair!
One night you see me, you get scared.

16
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,003
What about the other nights
when you don't see me, huh?

17
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,964
Last night you went
and got some water...

18
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:52,634
...and I was nice enough to hide
behind the door. What that about, huh?

19
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,179
- I didn't realize that.
- Ah.

20
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,473
Get out now!

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,225
Okay. You really want me out?

22
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,477
Yes, please.

23
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,313
Then I want to hear you say
you want me out.

24
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,773
I want you out.

25
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,649
I want to hear it from your lips.

26
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,569
Where'd you hear it before?

27
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,822
Oh, right, all right. You know what?
Consider me gone.

28
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,326
I'll be out by the time
you get home from work tomorrow.

29
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,871
Thank you.
I heard that.

30
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,466
- Thanks.
- Hey.

31
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,717
- Hey.
- Hey.

32
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,427
Well, look at you!

33
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,471
Finally got that
time machine working, huh?

34
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,099
You like it?

35
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,977
This guy was selling them
on 8th Avenue and I thought:

36
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,105
- "You know what I don't have?"
- A mirror?

37
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,025
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.

38
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,947
Wow! For a guy who's recently lost
his job, you're in a good mood.

39
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,284
I'll be all right.
I'm not starting from square one.

40
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,954
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray
on Days of our Lives.

41
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,957
Huh? That's got to have
some kind of cachet.

42
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,169
Cachet? Jaunty?

43
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,255
Chandler gave me
word-of-the-day toilet paper.

44
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,675
I'm gonna get some coffee.

45
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,052
- Hey.
Hey.

46
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,680
Oh! So? Did you read the book?

47
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,099
Oh, my God. It was incredible!

48
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,809
Didn't it, like, totally speak to you?

49
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,020
- Whoa, whoa, what book is this?
- Oh.

50
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,899
Uh! You have to read this book.
It's called Be Your Own Wind Keeper.

51
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,985
Ooh. It's about how women need
to become more empowered.

52
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,654
And, oh! But there's wind.

53
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,075
And the wind can make us goddesses.

54
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,120
Do you know who takes our wind?
Men. They just take it.

55
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,583
Men just take our wind?

56
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:33,754
Uh-huh. All the time.
Because they are the lightning-bearers.

57
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,757
- Wow.
Yeah.

58
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,718
That sounds kind of cool.
It's like The Hobbit.

59
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,095
It is nothing like The Hobbit.

60
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,974
It's like reading about
every relationship I've ever had.

61
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,476
Except for Richard.

62
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,645
Oh, yes. No.
Richard would never steal your wind.

63
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,230
- No.
No.

64
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,815
- Because he's yummy.
- Yes.

65
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,150
But all the other ones.

66
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,195
Oh, and the part about how
they're always drinking...

67
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,280
...from our pool of inner power.

68
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,741
But God forbid we should take a sip.

69
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,117
Anybody want a cruller?

70
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,704
This is a typical lightning-bearer thing.

71
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,539
Right there. It's like, um...

72
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:13,418
..."Hello. Who wants one of
my phallic-shaped man-cakes?"

73
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,096
Don't worry about it, already!
Things happen.

74
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:29,309
So you're not mad at me
for getting fired and everything?

75
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,728
Joey, look at me.

76
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,730
Look at me!

77
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,901
Do I have lipstick on my teeth?

78
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:41,989
No.

79
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,448
Uh, can we get back to me?

80
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:47,744
Look, honey. People get fired
left and right in this business.

81
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,914
I already got you an audition
for Another World.

82
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,499
All right!

83
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,252
"Cab Driver Number 2"?

84
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,129
You're welcome.

85
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,300
But... But I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

86
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:05,012
How can I go from being
a neurosurgeon to driving a cab?

87
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,682
Things change. Roll with them.

88
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,184
But this is a two-line part!

89
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,562
It's like taking a step backwards.

90
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,647
I'm not gonna do this.

91
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,483
Joey.

92
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,653
I'm gonna tell you the same thing
I told Al Minza...

93
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,197
...and his pyramid of dogs.

94
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,869
Take any job you can get,
and don't make on the floor.

95
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,414
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,082
I'll see you.

97
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,878
Uh, God!

98
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,464
Oh, God! I mean, it's just so...

99
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,923
Isn't it?

100
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,218
Uh. This is like reading
about my own life!

101
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:49,264
This book could have been called
Be Your Own Wind Keeper, Rachel!

102
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,142
It wouldn't have sold
a million copies...

103
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,519
...but it would've made
a nice gift for you.

104
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,938
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.

105
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,149
Uh, sweetie, we've gotta go.

106
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,400
No!

107
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,737
No? Heh.

108
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:08,784
No! Why do we always have to do
everything according to your timetable?

109
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:12,245
Actually, it's the movie theater
that has the timetable.

110
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,915
It's so you don't miss the beginning.

111
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:21,380
This isn't about the movie theater.
This is about you stealing my wind.

112
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,008
You go, girl!

113
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,138
I can't pull that off, can I?

114
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,935
Excuse me, your wind?

115
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,603
Yes, my wind.

116
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,648
How do you expect me to grow
if you won't let me blow?

117
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,907
You know I don't...

118
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,703
...have a problem with that.

119
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,213
Okay.

120
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,427
I just really need to be
with myself right now.

121
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,595
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,140
Mm, mm, mm.
- Uh, you're right.

123
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,683
I don't have to apologize.

124
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,185
Sorry. Damn it!

125
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,485
- What is it?
- I don't know.

126
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,530
It's got all this stuff
about wind and trees...

127
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,282
...and some sacred pool.

128
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,743
I don't really get it.
But she's pretty upset about it.

129
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,746
This is why I don't date
women who read.

130
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,541
Uh-oh.

131
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,042
What? What's that?

132
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,378
It's my VISA bill.

133
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,881
Envelope one of two.

134
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,760
- That can't be good.
- Open it, open it.

135
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,016
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa!

136
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,268
Look at this!
How did I spend so much money?

137
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:02,606
Uh, that's just the minimum amount.
That's your total.

138
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,608
Aah!

139
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:09,196
Whoa, whoa. Thirty-five hundred dollars
at "Porcelain Safari"?

140
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,780
My animals.

141
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,160
The guy said they suited me. He spoke
with an accent. I was confused.

142
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,828
Oh.

143
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,663
I don't know what to do!

144
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,833
You can start by driving a cab
on Another World.

145
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,793
- What?
- That audition?

146
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,754
That's a two-line part!

147
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:30,091
Joey, you owe $1100
at "I Love Lucite. "

148
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,636
- So what?
- So suck it up, man.

149
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,387
It's a job. It's money.

150
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:38,433
I don't need you getting judgmental
and condescending and pedantic.

151
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,020
- Toilet paper?
- Yeah.

152
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,900
I'm not being any of those things.
I'm being realistic.

153
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,986
- You're supposed to be my friend!
- I am your friend.

154
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,239
Then tell me things like,
"You'll be fine. "

155
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,659
And "Something big's gonna
come along. I know it!"

156
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,160
But I don't know it.

157
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,872
What I do know is you owe $2300
at "Isn't It Chromantic?"

158
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,292
I'm aware of what I owe.

159
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,296
Then get some sense.
It took you 10 years to get that job.

160
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,341
- How long till you get another?
- I don't want to hear this!

161
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,592
I'm just saying...

162
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,928
Well, don't "just say"!

163
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,848
Oh. Maybe I should just go.

164
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,685
Okay.

165
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,395
I'll see you later.

166
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,314
Just think about it.

167
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,400
I don't need to think about it!

168
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,860
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

169
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,904
That was huge!

170
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,615
Big things are gonna happen!
You'll see!

171
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:36,908
Ross!

172
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,952
You still there?

173
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,465
- Hey, pal.
- Oh, God!

174
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,844
What are you still doing here?

175
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,972
Uh, just some basic dehydrating
of fruits and vegetables.

176
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,683
Man alive, this thing's fantastic!

177
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,769
Aren't you forgetting anything?

178
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,105
Oh, yeah. I got us a new goldfish.

179
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,232
He's feistier than the last one.

180
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,527
Maybe because the last one
was made by Pepperidge Farm.

181
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,741
Eddie, isn't there something else
you're supposed to be doing now?

182
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,410
Not unless it's got something
to do with dehydrating.

183
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,412
Because right now,
I'm a dehydrating maniac!

184
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,876
I thought we had a deal.

185
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,711
- I thought by the time I got...
- Uh, uh.

186
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,004
You know what that is?

187
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,922
Your last roommate's kidney?

188
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,676
That's a tomato. Ha, ha.

189
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,762
This one definitely goes in the display.

190
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,100
It's in the display.

191
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,775
Hey, Gunther.
Let me get a, uh, lemonade to go.

192
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,360
Lemonade?

193
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,070
You okay, man?

194
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,572
Ahh, it's career stuff.

195
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,492
They killed off
my character on the show.

196
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,411
Oh, that's too bad.
How'd they do it?

197
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,538
I fell down an elevator shaft.

198
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,874
Oh. That sucks.

199
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,751
I was buried in an avalanche.

200
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,379
What?

201
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,131
I used to be Brice on All My Children.

202
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,738
Why must everybody watch me sleep?

203
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,616
There'll be no more
watching me sleep! No more...

204
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,867
...watching!
- I...

205
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,369
Neh.

206
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,711
I got some great stuff to dehydrate.
Grapes, apricots.

207
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,423
I thought it'd be cool to see
what happens with these water balloons.

208
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,676
Get out.
Get out, get out, get out!

209
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,929
- What?
- You! Move out!

210
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,267
Take your fruit!
Your stupid small fruit and get out!

211
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,436
You want me to move out? Uh...

212
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,150
Uh-huh.

213
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,694
Heh. I, uh...

214
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:22,198
Ooh! Ha, ha. I gotta tell you, that's kind
of out of the blue, don't you think?

215
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,201
This is not out of the blue!

216
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,579
This is smack-dab
in the middle of the blue!

217
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,414
Whoa!

218
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,083
Relax! Take it easy, buddy!

219
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,085
You don't have to tell me twice.

220
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,714
God, I mean, someone will be by
for my stuff.

221
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:46,222
If you think I'm leaving you
alone with my fish, you're insane!

222
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,600
You want some help?

223
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,685
No help required, chico!

224
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:02,739
All the way to the airport, huh?
You know, that's over 30 miles.

225
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:06,242
That's gonna cost you about so bucks.

226
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,661
Excuse me, that's "50" bucks.

227
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,832
- What?
- Five-O dollars.

228
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:17,712
Oh. You know what it is?
It's smudgy because they're fax pages.

229
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,840
When I was on Days ofour Lives
as Dr. Drake Ramoray...

230
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,344
...they'd send over
the whole script on real paper.

231
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,430
Ha, ha. That's great.

232
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:31,684
If you wanted to expand this scene,
like have the cab crash...

233
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,770
...I could attend to the victims...

234
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,064
...because I have a background
in medical acting.

235
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,275
Okay, listen, thanks for coming in.

236
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:43,655
No. Uh, don't thank me for coming in.
Uh, at least let me finish.

237
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,993
Uh, we could take the expressway...

238
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:53,665
...but, uh, this time of day
you're better off taking the budge.

239
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,546
You were going for bridge there,
weren't you?

240
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,631
I'll have a good day.

241
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,471
Okay, question number 28.

242
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,767
"Have you ever allowed
a lightning-bearer to take your wind?"

243
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,270
I would have to say no.

244
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,524
And I would have to say, "Pah, ha. "

245
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,651
What?

246
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,570
Do you not remember the puppet guy?

247
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:28,741
You totally let him wash his feet
in the pool of your inner power.

248
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,995
And his puppet too!

249
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,372
Well, at least I didn't let some guy...

250
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,500
...into the forest of my righteous truth
on the first date!

251
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,214
- Who?
- Paul!

252
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,799
Oh!

253
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,177
Okay, okay, moving on, moving on.
Next question.

254
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,888
Okay, number 29.

255
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,057
"Have you ever betrayed
another goddess...

256
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,227
...for a lightning-bearer?"
Okay, number 30.

257
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,314
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Let's go back to 29.

258
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,817
Not, uh...

259
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,236
Ahem. Not to my recollection.

260
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,073
Danny Arshack, ninth grade.

261
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,868
You know the bottle
was pointing at me.

262
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,787
Only because you took up
half the circle!

263
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,210
Listen to you two. It's so sad.

264
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,503
Oh!

265
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,923
Looks like I'll be going to
the goddess meetings alone.

266
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,466
Mm.

267
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,719
Not when they find out
you slept with Jason...

268
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,639
...an hour after
he broke up with Monica.

269
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,100
One hour?

270
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,687
- You are such a leaf blower!
Oh!

271
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,857
Ugh!

272
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,152
Ugh.

273
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,578
Oh, hey, uh,
be careful with that 3-D Last Supper.

274
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,539
Judas is a little loose.

275
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,796
Oh, my God! What's going on?

276
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:09,258
They're taking all my stuff back.
I guess you were right.

277
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,595
No, I wasn't right.
That's what I came here to tell you.

278
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:17,266
I was totally hung up
on my own stuff the other day.

279
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:21,187
No, listen. I need the whole
security thing, you know?

280
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:25,775
To know where my next paycheck is
coming from. But you don't need that.

281
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,735
And that's amazing to me.

282
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,238
I could never do what you do.

283
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,908
- Thanks.
- You hold out for something bigger.

284
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,202
I can't tell you
how much respect I have...

285
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,330
...for you not going
to that stupid audition.

286
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,165
- I went.
- Great! How did it go?

287
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,710
- I didn't get it.
- Good for you!

288
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,128
You're living the dream!

289
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,796
- Huh?
- Ha, ha.

290
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,840
All right, then!

291
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,926
- Oh, not my parrot.
- What?

292
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,929
I can't watch this.

293
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,640
Hey, hold on, hold on.

294
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,894
How much for the, uh?
How much to save the bird?

295
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,938
- Twelve hundred.
- Dollars?

296
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,899
You spent $1200 on a plastic bird?

297
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,069
Uh, it was an impulse buy.
Near the register.

298
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,989
Go ahead with the bird.

299
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,535
- Do you have anything for around $200?
- Uh.

300
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,203
The dog.

301
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,706
- Huh?
- Yeah.

302
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,792
I'll take it.

303
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,711
My gift to you, man.

304
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,381
Thanks, Ross!

305
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,675
I really liked that bird, though.

306
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,928
- But the dog! Oh!
- Yeah. Right?

307
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,813
Here are your cakes.

308
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,315
We didn't order cake.

309
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,610
No, I know. Ahem. They're from me.

310
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,154
You guys, this is not good.

311
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,865
We have enough trouble
with guys stealing our wind...

312
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,159
...without taking it from each other.

313
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,203
- You're right.
You know?

314
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,663
I love you goddesses.

315
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,249
I love you.

316
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,168
I don't ever want
to suck your wind again.

317
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,836
Oh.

318
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,464
- Thank you. So are we good?
- Oh. We're good.

319
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:12,757
- We're good?
- Yes.

320
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,469
Okay. Let me take these back.
They'll take it out of my paycheck.

321
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,682
Ding-dong, the psycho's gone!

322
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,939
- Are you sure this time?
Yes.

323
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,024
I actually saw him leave.

324
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,610
That guy is holding a human head.

325
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,446
He's holding a human head!

326
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:38,991
Check it out, man!

327
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,328
I tore it off a mannequin
in the alley behind Macy's. Ha, ha.

328
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,871
There is no alley behind Macy's.

329
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,541
So I got it in the junior miss
department. Big diff.

330
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,461
It'll make a hell of a conversation piece
at our next cocktail party, huh?

331
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,547
"Our next cocktail party"?

332
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:56,717
Yeah, you know, we'll put chips in it.
We'll make it a chip chick.

333
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,390
Eddie, do you remember yesterday?

334
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,684
Uh, yes, I think I vaguely recall it.

335
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,900
Ahem. Do you remember
talking to me yesterday?

336
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,277
Uh, yes.

337
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,658
So, what happened?

338
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,869
We took a road trip to Las Vegas!

339
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,954
Oh, sweet Moses!

340
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,167
So on this road trip,
uh, did you win any money?

341
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,587
Nah, I crapped out. But Mr. 21 here!
He cleans up!

342
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,089
$300! He buys me these new shoes.
Sweet, huh?

343
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:36,757
Nice.

344
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,051
Uh, see you upstairs. See you, pals!

345
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,974
Is anyone else starting
to really like him?

346
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,829
May I help you?

347
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,334
Why doesn't my key work,
and what's my stuff doing downstairs?

348
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,378
I'm sorry. Aah.

349
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,297
Have we met?

350
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,799
It's Eddie, you freak!
Your roommate.

351
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,385
I'm sorry, I, uh...

352
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,388
...I already have a roommate.

353
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,725
Hello.

354
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:35,942
Um, he's lived here for years.
I don't know what you're talking about.

355
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,985
No, no. He's, uh...

356
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:42,240
No, he moved out and I moved in.

357
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,701
Well, I think we'd remember
something like that.

358
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,455
I know I would. Ha, ha.

359
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,375
That's, uh, a good point. Um...

360
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,043
Okay, wow. Huh.

361
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,504
I guess I got the wrong apartment.

362
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,548
Look, I'm...

363
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,009
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Hey, no problem.

364
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,386
See you.

365
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:13,229
Goodbye, you fruit-drying psychopath.

366
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:18,609
- You want me to help you unpack?
- Nah, I'm okay. Oh, and, uh...

367
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,488
Just so you know, I'm not
moving back in because I have to.

368
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,408
I mean, I do have to, but...

369
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,786
It's just that that place,
it wasn't really...

370
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,788
I mean, this is...

371
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,708
Welcome home, man.

372
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,678
- A little foos?
- Absolutely!

373
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,057
What happened to the foosball?

374
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,184
It's a cantaloupe.

375
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,234
Are we gonna bring this out
every time Ross comes over?

376
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,986
He paid a lot of money for it.

377
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,037
- I'm gonna hold him a different way.
- All right.

378
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,958
If you hated it so much,
why'd you buy it in the first place?

379
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:20,046
Well, I had a whole ceramic-zoo thing
going over there.

380
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,715
But without the other ones,
it looks tacky.

381
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:27,219
Is he housetrained or will he leave
little bathroom tiles all over?

382
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,221
Stay.

383
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,058
Uh, stay!

384
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,435
Good fake dog.
