2
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,051
Flight number 457 from Beijing now arriving.

3
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,477
Oh, my God.

4
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,397
Oh, my... Excuse me. Move, move,
move! Emergency, please!

5
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,024
Excuse me, excuse me.

6
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,908
- Rach!
- Ah!

7
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,534
There you are!

8
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,620
Hey!
- Hi!

9
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,831
Oh! So, so.

10
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,793
How was China? You!

11
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,338
It was... It was great.
Oh, what happened?

12
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,256
- What? I am?
- You're bleeding.

13
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,050
- God.
- Oh, look at that! Yes, I am. Heh.

14
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,303
Enough about me,
Mr. Back From The Orient!

15
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:40,140
Come on, I wanna hear everything.
Everything!

16
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,103
Well, uh, where do I start? Um...

17
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,440
This is Julie.
Uh, Julie, this is Rachel.

18
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,276
Hi. Heh.

19
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,487
Uh, oh! These are...

20
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,281
- These are... Aren't for you.
- Oh.

21
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,284
Heh. Uh, these are for you.

22
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,329
Welcome to our country.

23
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:07,709
Thank you. I'm from New York.

24
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:13,715
Well, not a problem.
We'll use them to stop the bleeding.

25
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,844
Okay. Uh, baggage claim?

26
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,512
- Okay.
- Okay.

27
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,478
- No way.
- I'm telling you, she went to the airport.

28
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,438
And she's gonna go for it with Ross.

29
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:32,651
Oh, my God. This is huge. This...

30
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,070
This is bigger than huge.
This is...

31
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,322
All right, what's bigger than huge?

32
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,868
- Um, this?
- Yes.

33
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,453
Guys, you got new haircuts!

34
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,789
Yes, yes, we did.
Thanks to Vidal Buffay.

35
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,750
Because, you know:

36
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,253
"If you don't
look good, we don't look good. "

37
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,505
I love that voice! Ha, ha.

38
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,508
- You guys!
- Oh, oh.

39
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,094
Airport. Airport. Ross.

40
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,762
Not... Not alone.

41
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,057
Julie. Arm around her!

42
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,895
Unh! Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!

43
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,689
Okay, I think she's trying
to tell us something.

44
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,025
Quick, get the verbs.

45
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,444
- Ow.
- You! You!

46
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,112
You said he liked me!

47
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,822
You! You...!

48
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,450
You slowpokes!

49
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,494
That's all right, Rach.
We got the bags. Uh...

50
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,580
Hi. Hello.

51
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,792
Julie, this is my sister, Monica.
This is Chandler.

52
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,878
- Hey.
- Phoebe, hi. Mwah.

53
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,963
- Joey, what up?
- Hey.

54
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,717
- Everyone, this is Julie.
- Julie.

55
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,178
Oh.

56
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,932
Hi!

57
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,184
Hi! But I'm not here,
you haven't met me.

58
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,896
I'll make a better impression when
I don't have 20 hours of plane on me.

59
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,065
- And bus.
- Oh, my God!

60
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,442
- With the screaming guy...
- And the spitting.

61
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,736
You gotta hear this story.

62
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,030
We're on this bus
that's 200 years old.

63
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,865
Two hundred, at least.

64
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,494
- And this guy...
- And the chicken poops in her lap! Ha!

65
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,834
Oh, I'm so sorry.

66
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,212
I just gave away the ending, didn't I?

67
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,673
Ugh, I just heard this story in the cab...

68
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,677
...and it is all I can think about.

69
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,807
This is amazing. I mean, how...?

70
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,060
- How did this happen?
- Ross and I were in grad school together.

71
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,480
We haven't seen each other since then.
I land in China...

72
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,942
...guess who's in charge of the dig?
- Julie!

73
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,987
Julie. Isn't that great?

74
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:45,200
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

75
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,329
It's an expression.

76
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,207
We just wanted to say a quick hi.

77
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,960
- Then we're gonna go see the baby.
- Then get some sleep.

78
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,546
Yeah, it's 6:00 tomorrow night, our time.

79
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,840
Well don't tell us
what's gonna happen, though

80
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,800
Because I like to be surprised.

81
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,723
Bye!
Bye.

82
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,485
- Rach. Can I get some coffee? Thank you.
- Sure.

83
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,362
- Hey, Rach...
- Did you talk to him yet?

84
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,448
- No.
- Then, no.

85
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,338
So, what the hell happened
to you in China?

86
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,674
I mean, when last we left you,
you were in love with, you know.

87
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,093
I know. I know I was.

88
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,929
But there was always this voice
inside that kept saying:

89
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:52,184
"It's never gonna happen. Move on. "
You know whose voice that was?

90
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,269
God?

91
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,855
It was you, pal.

92
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,691
Well, maybe it was God doing me.

93
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:05,113
You were right. She looks at me
and sees a friend. That's all.

94
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,991
And then I met Julie, and...

95
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,993
I don't know. We're having a great time.

96
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:14,456
I never would have gone for it with her,
if it hadn't been for you.

97
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,293
Well, you owe me one, big guy.

98
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,421
- Here's your lemonade.
- I didn't order lemonade.

99
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,508
Oh. Well then you better go
take that back.

100
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,259
They're gonna charge you for that.

101
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,929
- But...
- Go, go, go! Come on, come on!

102
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,225
Okay, so, uh, what did you find out?

103
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:37,062
He said...

104
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,526
He said they're having a great time.

105
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,028
- I'm sorry.
- What?

106
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,864
But the silver lining,
if you wanna see it...

107
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:51,493
...is that he made this decision
all by himself...

108
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,663
...without any outside help whatsoever.

109
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,833
How is that a silver lining?

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,627
You have to really wanna see it.

111
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,094
Ironically, these guys
were picked last in gym.

112
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,763
Hey, Pheebs.

113
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,808
- You know what I'm thinking?
- Oh, okay.

114
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,355
How...

115
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,233
...it's been so long
since you've had sex...

116
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,944
...you're wondering
if they've changed it?

117
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,740
No. Although now
that's what I'm thinking.

118
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,869
So, what were you thinking?

119
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,496
I was thinking
you gave the guys great haircuts.

120
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,206
I thought you'd like to do mine.

121
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,083
Oh! No.

122
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,337
- Why not?
- Because I'm just...

123
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:48,049
I'm incredibly anal and
an unbelievable control freak.

124
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,759
No, you're not.

125
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,803
I know I'm not, but you are.

126
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,097
I was trying to spare your feelings.

127
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,059
Hello? Oh, hi.

128
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:01,104
Yeah, hold on a second.
Ross, Julie for you.

129
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,443
Hello? Hi.

130
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,779
Hey. Anybody know a good tailor?

131
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,990
- You need clothes altered?
- No, no.

132
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,868
I'm just looking for a man
to draw on me with chalk.

133
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,914
Go see Frankie. My family's
been going to him forever.

134
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,999
He did my first suit when I was 15.

135
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,543
No, wait, 16.

136
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:27,380
No, excuse me, heh, 15.

137
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,842
All right, when was 1990?

138
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,014
Okay, you have to stop the Q-Tip
when there's resistance.

139
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,441
Okay. Okay.
Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

140
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,653
Okay, bye. What?

141
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,448
Oh, that is so sweet.

142
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,993
No... Ha, ha.

143
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,246
No. Okay. No, you hang up.

144
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,122
No, you... Okay.

145
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,960
Okay. One, two, three.

146
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,003
Shh.

147
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,966
Well you didn't hang up either.
She didn't hang up.

148
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,681
Okay, no. No, you hang up.

149
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,600
You. You. Yo...

150
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,611
Sorry, I thought
you were talking to me.

151
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,365
- Rachel. Heh.
- Sorry.

152
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,784
- I'll just call her back.
- Okay.

153
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,371
Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry.
We got disconnected.

154
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,831
No, you hang up.

155
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,333
Okay, okay, okay.
How did this happen to me? How?

156
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,336
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.

157
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,298
Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.

158
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:55,010
Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...

159
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:59,764
...ugh, this really great guy
that I can't have.

160
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,267
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.

161
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,602
I know you did.

162
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,148
Ugh. I'm just gonna deal with it.
I'm just gonna deal with it

163
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,570
I gotta get out of here!

164
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,035
I don't care what you guys say.
Something's bothering her.

165
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,126
You know, I think I was 16.

166
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,048
Please, just a little bit off the back.

167
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,549
Um, I'm still on "no. "

168
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,928
- Uh, morning.
- Hey.

169
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,097
Could you close your eyes for a sec?

170
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,434
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not falling for that again.

171
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:50,106
- What's going on?
- I sort of did a stupid thing last night.

172
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,067
What stupid thing did you do?

173
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,862
Ew!

174
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,537
Why don't you just go get dressed...

175
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:08,208
...then you'll be on your way.
Bye-bye.

176
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,044
Rachel, how did this happen?

177
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,546
I don't know,
I kind of ran into him last night.

178
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,090
- Where?
- At his apartment.

179
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,800
Is this juice?

180
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:21,179
Whoa. And the fact that you dumped him
because he hit on Phoebe?

181
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,474
Oh, God, I know.
I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.

182
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,894
Honey, you're not pathetic.
You're just sad.

183
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,438
Yeah. People do stupid things
when they're upset.

184
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,692
My God, if I had a nickel
for every guy I wish I hadn't...

185
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,323
But this is about your horrible mistake.

186
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,910
- Hi.
Hey!

187
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,246
- Hi...
Sorry we're late.

188
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,664
We were, uh...

189
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,166
Well, there was touching.

190
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,547
- Hey...!
- Oh.

191
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,216
- Hey, Ross!
- Paolo. Ha.

192
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,718
What a...

193
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,304
What, uh...?
What are you doing here?

194
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,306
- I do Raquel.
- Ah.

195
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,481
So, uh, he's back?

196
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,234
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?

197
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,861
No, not a problem.

198
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,363
Good. Glad it's not a problem.

199
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,908
Okay, you're gonna
have to not touch my ass.

200
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:31,458
Well, despite the yummy bagels
and palpable tension...

201
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,585
...I've got pants that need to be altered.

202
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,297
Oh, when you see Frankie,
tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.

203
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,132
He'll know what it means.

204
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,220
You sure he's gonna be able
to crack that code?

205
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:49,642
It's funny. The last time Paolo was here,
my hair was so much shorter and cuter.

206
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,395
All right. Okay.

207
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:57,066
But... But! You have to promise that you
will not be all controlly and bossy...

208
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,028
...and all, you know, Monica about it.

209
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:01,738
I promise.

210
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,573
All right, let's see.

211
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:07,911
Now, some of you are gonna get cut
and some of you aren't.

212
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,289
But I promise,
none of you will feel a thing.

213
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,958
Okay.

214
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:28,389
- All right, that's it. I quit.
- What? I didn't say anything!

215
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:32,310
Yeah, but this isn't the face of
a person who trusts a person.

216
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,396
This is the face of
a person who, you know...

217
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,690
...doesn't trust a person.

218
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,485
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe.

219
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,405
It's just a little shorter
than what we had discussed.

220
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:48,076
Would you relax?
I know what I am doing.

221
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,870
This is how he wears it.

222
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,458
- How who wears it?
- Demi Moore.

223
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,503
Heh. Demi Moore is not a he.

224
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,422
Well, he was a he
in Arthur and in 10.

225
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,134
That's Dudley Moore!

226
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,096
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!

227
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,974
- Oh. Oh!
- Oh, my God!

228
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,143
- Oh, God!
- Oh, my God!

229
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,688
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

230
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,231
Which one is Demi Moore?

231
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,278
She's the actress that was in
Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!

232
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,113
Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.

233
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,490
- I know!
- Oh, my God!

234
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,957
How long do you want the cuffs?

235
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,877
At least as long as I have the pants.

236
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,465
I just got that.

237
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,846
Okay. Now we'll do your inseam.

238
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,028
How is she?

239
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,614
It's too soon to tell.

240
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,367
She's resting, which is a good sign.

241
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,288
- How's the hair?
- I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross.

242
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,206
It doesn't look good.

243
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,295
I put a clip on one side, which seems
to have stopped the curling.

244
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,298
Can we see her?

245
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,009
Your hair looks too good.
It would upset her.

246
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,387
Ross, why don't you come on in.

247
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,980
- Well, how you doing?
- I'm okay.

248
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,608
- Ooh, that bad, huh?
- What?

249
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,278
Look, I can sense when women
are depressed and vulnerable.

250
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,948
It's one of my gifts. Sit.

251
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,784
Ugh.

252
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:57,956
Ugh, Joey, when I saw him
get off that plane with her...

253
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,417
...I really thought I just hit rock bottom.

254
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:05,129
But today, it's like there's rock bottom...

255
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,256
...50 feet of crap...

256
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,342
...then me.

257
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,928
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.

258
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,223
Oh, come on, how can I just tell him?
What about Julie?

259
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,267
What about her? They've only
been going out for two weeks.

260
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:21,729
Ross has been in love
with you for 10 years.

261
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,108
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Look, Rach, Rach.

262
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,694
I've been with my share of women.

263
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,239
I've been with a lot
of people's share of women.

264
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,825
But the point is...

265
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:38,121
...I've never felt about anyone
the way Ross felt about you.

266
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,666
Really?

267
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,091
Yo, paisan.

268
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,804
Can I talk to you for a sec?

269
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,809
Your tailor...

270
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,395
...is a very bad man!

271
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,734
- Frankie? What are you talking about?
- Hey, what's going on?

272
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,449
Joey's tailor...

273
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,829
...took advantage of me.

274
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,041
- What?
- No way.

275
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,543
I've been going to the guy for 12 years.

276
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,879
Oh, come on.
He said he was gonna do my inseam.

277
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,716
Then he ran his hand up my leg
and then there was definite...

278
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,301
What?

279
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,470
Cupping.

280
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,142
That's how they do pants!

281
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,229
First they go up one side,
they move it over.

282
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:49,484
Then they go up the other side,
move it back, then they do the rear.

283
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,364
What? Ross, tell him.
Isn't that how a tailor measures pants?

284
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,617
Yes, yes, it is. In prison!

285
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,751
What's the matter with you?

286
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,377
What?

287
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,257
That's not?

288
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,973
Oh, my God.

289
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,274
Even Mary Tyler Moore
would've been better.

290
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,362
I like it.

291
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,197
Yeah, I do. I think it's a 10!

292
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,578
Thank you. My hair is very amused.

293
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,498
Oh, come on, things could be worse.
I mean, uh...

294
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,417
You could "get caught between
the moon and New York City.

295
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,839
I know it's crazy, but it's true. "

296
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,260
Thank you.

297
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,595
- Well, I gotta go. Bye.
- See you.

298
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,055
Bye, Rach!

299
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,890
Wait, are you leaving?

300
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,518
That's what I meant by "bye. "

301
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,854
Well, uh, can I talk to you for a sec?

302
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,480
Okay.

303
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,777
When the doctor does
that hernia test...

304
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,071
That's okay.

305
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,326
- What's going on?
- Um...

306
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,914
- Well, um, okay, first of all...
- Mm-hm.

307
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:30,001
...Paolo and I are not back together.

308
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,961
That was a stupid thing I did.

309
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,298
If I could go back in time
and do it again...

310
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,633
...well, I wouldn't.

311
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,760
- Ahem.
- Um...

312
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,971
- Heh.
- Second of all...

313
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,557
What?

314
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,227
Before I say anything...

315
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:51,230
...is this one of those things
where you break up with a guy.

316
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,857
Then I tell you what I think...

317
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,443
...and the next day
you get back together with him...

318
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,446
...and I look like a complete idiot?
- No, no, no.

319
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,991
Okay. Um, well, then,
I think the guy's scum.

320
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,621
I hate him. I mean, I actually...
I physically hate him.

321
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,165
You know? I always have.

322
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:13,336
And you are way too good
to be with a guy like that.

323
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,755
- Really?
- Rach?

324
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,549
You deserve to be with someone
who appreciates you...

325
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,010
...and who gets how funny...

326
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,679
...and sweet and amazing...

327
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,974
...and adorable and sexy you are.

328
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:30,770
You know? Someone who wakes up
every morning thinking:

329
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,649
"Oh, my God. I'm with Rachel!" Heh.

330
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,735
You know? Someone
who makes you feel good.

331
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,071
Like the way I do with Julie.

332
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,329
Was there a "second of all"?

333
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,707
Um...

334
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:57,129
No, um, I think that was the whole "all. "

335
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,967
I gotta go. Okay?

336
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,636
- Okay.
- Thanks.

337
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,846
Okay.

338
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,187
No, I swear to God, Dad!

339
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,481
That's not how they measure pants!

340
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:26,492
I was thinking of doing it shorter,
like Andie MacDowell's haircut.

341
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,536
- Oh, yeah. Oh, I could do that.
- Really?

342
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,247
- Yeah. You wanna do it now?
- Great!

343
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,124
- Okay.
- Okay.

344
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,875
See you.

345
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,586
Okay, I just wanna make
really sure this time.

346
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:38,838
Uh-huh. Ahem.

347
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:43,342
Andie MacDowell is the girl from
Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?

348
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,469
No.

349
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:51,392
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's Roddy McDowall.

350
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,354
Andie MacDowell is the guy
from Planet of the Apes.

351
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,149
- Oh! Yeah, okay.
- Yeah. Okay?

352
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,234
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
