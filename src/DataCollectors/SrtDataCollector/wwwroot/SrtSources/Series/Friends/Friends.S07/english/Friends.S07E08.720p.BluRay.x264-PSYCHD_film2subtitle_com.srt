1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,964
- Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving.
- Shh.

2
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:10,009
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving
a secret this year?

3
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,344
No, we're playing this game
I learned at work.

4
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,097
You have to name all the states
in six minutes.

5
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,933
What? That's, like, insanely easy.

6
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,728
No, it's harder than it sounds.
You always forget at least one.

7
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:24,106
Or in some cases, 14.

8
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,943
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing
against other people...

9
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,862
...so technically, I didn't lose.

10
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,072
You forgot 14 states?

11
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,658
Nobody cares about the Dakotas.

12
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,494
Oh, okay, time's up.

13
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,079
All right, I got 48.

14
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,789
Oh, that's not bad. Pheebs?

15
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:45,085
Oh, I got tired of naming states,
so I decided to list the types of celery.

16
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,256
And I have one, regular celery.

17
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:54,470
Okay, so Rachel's got 48
and Phoebe has the lead in...

18
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,389
...vegetables. Joey?

19
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,893
Say hello to the new champ
of Chandler's dumb states game.

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,105
- Wow, how many you got?
- Fifty-six.

21
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,482
Hey, how is New England not a state?

22
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,859
Huh? They have a sports team.

23
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,987
Does South Oregon have a sports team?

24
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,783
There you go.

25
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,787
How come we have
one extra place setting?

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,416
- Because you invited your assistant.
- Oh, right, sorry. Tag's not coming.

27
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,503
His girlfriend came into town,
so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.

28
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:10,796
Oh, why didn't you tell me?

29
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,216
I made him his own individual
sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.

30
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,553
Oh, well, I was going to,
but then I figured, you know...

31
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:21,014
...your food is so delicious
and perfect...

32
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,560
...you can never have too many
of those pumpkin things.

33
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,857
You'd think I wouldn't enjoy that
because it is so fake, ha, ha, but I still do.

34
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,818
Regular celery.

35
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,862
Oh, I already have that.

36
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,826
Done, with time to spare.

37
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:45,706
- Ooh, this may be a new world's record.
- You know, I hate to lecture you guys...

38
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:49,585
...but it's kind of disgraceful that
a group of well-educated adults...

39
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:54,464
...and Joey, can't name all the states.

40
00:02:54,716 --> 00:03:00,095
You ever see a map or one of those
round colorful things called a globe?

41
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:04,349
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.

42
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:08,228
- What? That's impossible.
Forty-six.

43
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,857
Well, who's well-educated now,
Mr. I-Forgot-Ten-States?

44
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,944
I'm out of oven space.
I'm gonna go turn on Joey's.

45
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:19,156
Please, watch him.
Do not let Joey eat any of the food.

46
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,033
I am only one man.

47
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,871
- Okay, time is up.
- Give me another minute.

48
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,208
Ross, if you don't know them by now,
you will never know them, okay?

49
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:33,462
That is the beauty of this game.
It makes you want to kill yourself.

50
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,964
This is crazy. I can do this.

51
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,635
All right, uh, I bet I can get
all 50, uh, before dinner.

52
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,095
Okay, but if you can't, no dinner.

53
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,680
You're on.

54
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,559
All right, don't look at my list, because
there's a lot on there that you don't have.

55
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,397
Hey, did you guys know
your oven doesn't work?

56
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,484
But the drawer full of takeout menus
is okay, right?

57
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,488
- Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
- Shh.

58
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,657
Chandler, give me a hand.

59
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:07,079
Sure. Joey, do not let Ross look at any
maps or the globe in your apartment.

60
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:10,249
Don't worry, Chandler.
It's not a globe of the United States.

61
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,592
Hey, you guys, I'm gonna go out
and take a walk.

62
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,095
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?

63
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,847
- Oh, it's not.
- Seriously, it's moving.

64
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,559
- What the hell's in there?
- It's just my knitting. That's all.

65
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,484
Yes, I knit this.

66
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,612
I'm very good.

67
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,453
Ross' apartment is nice.
Why don't we hang out here more often?

68
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,455
I don't know.
Maybe because it smells weird.

69
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,916
It's like old pumpkins or something.

70
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,461
- That's my pie.
- Which smells delicious.

71
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,964
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- What?

72
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,133
We left Joey alone with the food.

73
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,593
Yep, yep, I knew it.

74
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,429
There he is...

75
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,765
...feeding stuffing to a dog.

76
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,316
Hi, Geller-Bing residence.
How can I help?

77
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,110
Phoebe, why is there a dog
in our apartment?

78
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,112
I'm sorry, who's this?

79
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,324
Phoebe, there's a dog
sitting on my couch.

80
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,618
Tell her I'm allergic, and I will sue.

81
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,206
- No, there's no dog here.
- There is.

82
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,584
He's black and white and shaggy.

83
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,170
He's sitting next to Rachel
and licking Rachel's hand.

84
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,881
Oh, my God. Where are you?

85
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,301
I'll be right there.

86
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,347
They're here already?
How are they doing this?

87
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,605
Hi, Tag.
What are you doing here?

88
00:05:56,814 --> 00:06:00,025
I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend
Thanksgiving with you was still good.

89
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,235
Well, sure. Come in.

90
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,113
Well, what happened
to your girlfriend?

91
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,574
We, uh, kind of broke up this morning.

92
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:11,203
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.

93
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,039
Ohio, thank you.

94
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,212
Huh. Where's the dog?

95
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,589
What dog? There's no dog here.

96
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,883
Yeah, that dog left.

97
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,428
Phoebe.

98
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,263
Phoebe, open up.

99
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,973
There's no dog in here.

100
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,561
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking.

101
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,397
No, that's just me coughing.

102
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,904
Oh, good. There you are.

103
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,199
Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.

104
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,284
What is it doing here?

105
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,787
I'm watching it for friends
who went out of town.

106
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,247
Wait.

107
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,418
Hello, my name is Klunkers.

108
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,754
May I please stay
with you nice people?

109
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:07,134
Oh, I wish he could stay here,
but Chandler's allergic.

110
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,136
Extremely allergic, okay?

111
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,556
If I am anywhere near a dog
for more than five minutes...

112
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,392
...my throat will just close up.

113
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:19,146
That's odd, because this dog's
been living here for the past three days.

114
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,528
Really?

115
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,573
If the dog has been here that long...

116
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,576
...and you haven't had a reaction,
maybe you're not allergic to this dog.

117
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,953
Well, it still has to go, right?

118
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,329
Why?

119
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,292
- Okay, it's, um...
- Don't do it.

120
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,254
- Don't do what?
- I have to.

121
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,756
Okay? It's time.

122
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,596
Okay, I hate dogs.

123
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,764
- What?
- That's crazy. Why?

124
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,809
Told you.

125
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,065
They are needy...

126
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,194
...they are jumpy, and you can't tell
what they are thinking...

127
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,905
...and that scares me a little bit.

128
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,200
You're right. They are scary. Aah!

129
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,786
She just ate a treat out of my hand!

130
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:22,083
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs?
I mean, not even puppies?

131
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,919
Is there a puppy here?

132
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,298
- You don't like puppies?
- Okay, you are new.

133
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,681
Look, Chandler, I told you.
Never tell anyone about this dog thing.

134
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,850
It's like Ross not liking ice cream.

135
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,730
- You don't like ice cream?
- It's too cold.

136
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,859
Okay, it's just that dogs make me
a little uncomfortable.

137
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,569
Hurts my teeth.

138
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,948
I don't wanna say this.
I don't want you guys to hate me...

139
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,576
...but, uh, I don't think I can be
around that dog anymore, okay?

140
00:08:56,827 --> 00:09:00,580
So either the dog goes or I go. Huh.

141
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,755
Oh, my God.

142
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,803
How can I not get this?

143
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:18,557
I'm a college professor.
I got 1450 on my SATs.

144
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,183
Twelve fifty.

145
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,353
Damn, I forgot you were here.

146
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,273
All right.
We're gonna take Klunkers to Ross'.

147
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,732
We'll be back in a minute.

148
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,818
Oh, wait, before you go,
can I ask a question?

149
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,821
Um, when a guy breaks up
with his girlfriend...

150
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,117
...what is an appropriate amount of time
to wait before you make a move?

151
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,994
Oh, I'd say about a month.

152
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,414
- Really? I'd say three to four.
- Half-hour.

153
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,169
Interesting.

154
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,839
When it's your assistant,
I would say never.

155
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:54,634
All right, Rach, the big question is,
does he like you?

156
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,805
Right? Because if he doesn't like you,
this is all a moo point.

157
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:03,184
Huh. A "moo" point?

158
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,189
Yeah. It's like a cow's opinion.

159
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,735
It just doesn't matter.

160
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,697
It's "moo."

161
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:25,707
Have I been living with him for too long,
or did that all just make sense?

162
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,961
Please don't listen to Joey.
Okay? Would you look at him?

163
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,922
He's obviously depressed.
He's away from his family.

164
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,799
He's spending Thanksgiving
with strangers.

165
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,093
What he needs right now
is for you to be his friend.

166
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,888
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry. Thank you.

167
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:44,059
- Okay, that's what I'm going to do.
- Fine, take their advice.

168
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,769
No one ever listens to me.

169
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,481
When the package is this pretty,
no one cares what's inside.

170
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,697
- Hey.
- Hey.

171
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,491
How you holding up?

172
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,409
- Not bad.
- Yeah?

173
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,913
- I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
- Thanks.

174
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:09,376
- Were you guys together a long time?
- A year, on and off.

175
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,046
I thought we'd end up together.
I don't anymore.

176
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,757
- Now that she broke up with you.
- Yeah.

177
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,677
- Hmm.
- It's weird.

178
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:23,306
I always used to assume that I would meet
someone and fall in love and be happy.

179
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:27,602
That all that was just a given.
Well, lately, it's like, what if it's not?

180
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,105
Do you ever have that feeling?

181
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,815
No.

182
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,483
Yeah.

183
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,820
All the time. Constantly. It's terrifying.

184
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,323
But, you know, then I figure
it has to work out.

185
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,325
Why?

186
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,161
Because it has to.

187
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,958
- You have all the answers, don't you?
- Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.

188
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:54,796
- Hey, thanks for talking to me.
- Come on, what are bosses for?

189
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,423
Hug it out.

190
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,135
All right, he likes you back.

191
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:05,181
Huh? Told you you should go for it.

192
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,809
What?

193
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,398
Street noise drown any of that out?

194
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,485
No? All right, I'll see you later.
Ha, ha. Okay.

195
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,826
What did Joey say? I like you back?

196
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,704
Uh, yeah... You know, well, see, he...

197
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:33,710
Joey knows that I'm very insecure
about my back.

198
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:37,213
And... And you were hugging me...

199
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:41,593
...so obviously you are not
repulsed by it. Yeah. Heh.

200
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,138
Wait a minute,
that doesn't make any sense.

201
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,389
No?

202
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,562
All right, here's the truth. Ahem.

203
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,774
Joey said what he said because, um...

204
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,319
...I'm attracted to you.

205
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,490
- Wow.
- Yeah, I admit it.

206
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:08,912
I have a crush on you. And, uh, I know
that's crazy because we work together...

207
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,872
...and nothing could ever happen.

208
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,500
And the last thing I wanted to do
was freak you out...

209
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,669
...or make you feel uncomfortable.

210
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:21,424
Which is why it would be really great
if you said something right about now.

211
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,261
Oh, my God.
Those guys are stealing my car.

212
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,264
- What?
- Right there. That's my car.

213
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,643
- Hey!
- Okay, that's gonna take a minute.

214
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,437
Do you have anything else
you wanna get off your chest?

215
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,980
I can't believe this.

216
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,901
Wait, we still have time to talk,
and they're not even in the car yet.

217
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,070
Oh, look, there they go. Okay.

218
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,449
Okay, Phoebe.
We should probably go back now.

219
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,369
Please, don't leave me. I'll be lonely.

220
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,497
Stop it. Stop.

221
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:56,459
- Okay, let's go. We can be strong.
- Yeah, okay.

222
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,465
Oh, my God, did you hear that?
She said "Monica."

223
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,052
Oh, I can't leave her.

224
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,347
If you want, we could sneak the dog
back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.

225
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,598
That's not gonna work.

226
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,977
I had that dog there for three days
and Chandler had no idea.

227
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,603
He's not so smart.

228
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,398
Hey. I didn't know either.

229
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:22,944
Yeah, but you kind of knew that
something was going on, didn't you?

230
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,904
Yeah, I knew. Heh.

231
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,078
Where's Chandler?

232
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,915
- Here I am.
- Wash your hands.

233
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,878
How did you know?

234
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,092
Hey, what's she doing back here?

235
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,220
Relax, Ross.
She's not made of ice cream.

236
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:54,267
Hey, look, Phoebe.
I, uh, laid out the states geographically.

237
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,852
No, no, we don't have time for this.

238
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,812
We have to keep Chandler
away from my room.

239
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,147
Yeah, but, look what I...

240
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,941
See, this is exactly
what we do not have time for.

241
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,866
- Where's Monica?
- Uh, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in.

242
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,326
Why not?

243
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,830
Monica's crying.

244
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:21,169
She's very upset
about this whole Klunkers thing.

245
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,505
- Well, I should go in there.
- No, no.

246
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:28,217
No, she doesn't want to see you
right now.

247
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:32,388
- Why not?
- Because you sent away the dog.

248
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,892
- That's ridiculous.
- Oh, is it? Is it?

249
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:42,690
Look, when Monica and I were kids,
we had a dog named Rover.

250
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,778
And, um, one day, my dad decides
he doesn't like dogs.

251
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,949
So Monica and her friend... Phyllis...

252
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,286
...take away the dog, and that was
the last time we ever saw him.

253
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,957
Don't you see? This is just like that...

254
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:03,002
...only with a few details changed.

255
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,591
Okay, I'm in my sweatpants.

256
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,134
Bring on the food.

257
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,140
- What's the matter?
- Monica's all upset...

258
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,685
...because I sent Klunkers away.

259
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,104
So? Bring the dog back. You're a hero.

260
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,066
Yeah, I could be a hero.
I could do that. I could... I could do...

261
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,527
What if it...? What if it attacks me?

262
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,780
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.

263
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,076
And that doesn't scare you?

264
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,833
Ross, you need some help?

265
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,334
From you?

266
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,629
Yes, please.

267
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,554
First of all, Utah?

268
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,473
Dude, you can't just make stuff up.

269
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,190
I hate America.

270
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,944
When I finish this game,
I swear I am moving.

271
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,158
- Hey. Tag still talking to the police?
- Yeah.

272
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,910
Ugh, damn it. Why did I open my mouth?

273
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,830
"I have a crush on you.
I'm attracted to you."

274
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,207
I know that I freaked him out.

275
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,002
If you said it like that,
you probably did, yeah.

276
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,547
Hey, is Chandler here?

277
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,133
Uh, no, no, he went for a walk.

278
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,802
Okay, well, you cannot tell him,
but look who's back.

279
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:39,265
- Hi.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

280
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,893
He went over to Ross'
to bring the dog back here.

281
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,896
Oh, no, the dog's not going to be there.

282
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:47,899
You think?

283
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,446
Hi, honey.

284
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,699
Please, please, please,
don't be mad at me.

285
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,868
- What? Why would...?
- Shh. Wait and see.

286
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,370
Maybe we will, maybe we won't.

287
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:06,084
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to
bring back Klunkers, you know, for you...

288
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:10,838
...and, ahem, I left the door open,
and she must've gotten out.

289
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:15,593
And I looked everywhere, all over
the apartment, including the roof.

290
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,764
Which, FYI, Ross,
one of your neighbors, growing weed.

291
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,059
I couldn't find him...

292
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,230
...and I am so, so, so sorry.

293
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:32,026
But I do know where we can all go
ease the pain.

294
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,823
We have good news. Look who's back.

295
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,574
Hi.

296
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,827
Klunkers. Oh, my God.

297
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:46,624
- That's right. She came back all by herself.
- It's a Thanksgiving miracle.

298
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,878
It is so good to see you.

299
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,214
Yeah, she came all the way back
from Ross' building.

300
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,175
Oh, the things she must've seen.

301
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,553
Then she climbed up the fire escape...

302
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,430
...and she tapped on the window
with her teeny little paw...

303
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,516
...and we ran to let her in.

304
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,270
I went too far, didn't I?

305
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,189
When should I have stopped?

306
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:20,116
Okay, maybe this is so hard
because there aren't 50 states.

307
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,413
Let me tell you something.
I have 49 states.

308
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,707
Now, there are no more.

309
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,003
Now, I think I should be able
to eat something.

310
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,213
It's up to you.

311
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,888
- Oh, hi. How are you doing?
- I'm okay.

312
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,099
I gotta go down to the police station
and look at mug shots.

313
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,437
- Thanks for having me over, you guys.
- Tag, you're going? Uh...

314
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,023
We didn't, uh, get a chance to talk.

315
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,650
So where did you say you're from again?

316
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,320
- Colorado.
- Ah, what good are you?

317
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,496
Look, um, I think we should talk about
what happened on the terrace.

318
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,081
- Okay.
- Uh...

319
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,000
I never should've said what I said.

320
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,211
You know what?
It just doesn't matter how I feel.

321
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:17,465
We work together, so nothing could really
ever happen between us.

322
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:22,595
What I would love is just to go to work
on Monday and never talk about this again.

323
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,264
Okay? Big day, Monday. Lots to do.

324
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,309
So we okay?

325
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,686
Um, I'm not.

326
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,232
- Oh, God, I knew it. I freaked you out.
- No, you didn't.

327
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,609
The only thing that freaked me out
was you saying...

328
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,694
...that nothing could happen between us.

329
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,031
- Really?
- Yeah.

330
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,409
So please don't fire me
for doing this.

331
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,673
Okay, well, that's one less thing
we have to do on Monday.

332
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,654
Delaware.

333
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,867
