1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,715
- So you and Rach tonight, huh?
- Yeah.

2
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:10,384
Yeah, it's actually
our first official date.

3
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:13,137
Wow, so tonight may be the night.
You nervous?

4
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:17,016
Nah. No. This is the part
I'm actually good at, ha, ha.

5
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:21,812
What must it be like not to be
crippled by fear and self-loathing?

6
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,648
It's okay.

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,027
How can you be so confident?

8
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:31,030
Well, I know exactly
what I'm gonna do.

9
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:35,451
- Really? Like, you have a routine?
- No. See, each woman is different.

10
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:38,495
You have to appreciate
their uniqueness.

11
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,874
- Really?
- No, I do six things.

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,170
First, I look deep into her eyes,
then I kiss her.

13
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:51,383
Next, I take my hand
and I softly graze her thigh.

14
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,343
You mean like this?

15
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:01,560
No, not like that. No, no.
No, like this:

16
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,566
I see what you mean.
That's quite nice.

17
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,822
Ahem. More foosball?

18
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,699
- And beer.
- Yeah.

19
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,127
- Hey.
- Hey.

20
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,295
Hey, sweetie.

21
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,133
Wow.

22
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,305
Hey, stop staring at my wife's legs.

23
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:24,476
No, no. Stop staring
at your sister's legs.

24
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:28,147
I'm sorry, it's just...
How'd you get so tan?

25
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,567
She went to one of those
spray-on tan places.

26
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,611
You got a spray-on tan?

27
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,322
Chandler gets pedicures.

28
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,659
What? You do?
Like, with the toe separators?

29
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,620
Why? Why?

30
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,540
I can't believe that's sprayed on.

31
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,793
I mean, it looks really good.
I wonder if I should get one.

32
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:54,339
Sure, then you should get a miniskirt
so you can really show it off.

33
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:58,760
So do you get colors
or just French tips?

34
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:06,268
- Here. Here's their card.
- Thanks.

35
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,770
Hey, I know where this place is.

36
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,231
It used to be an X-rated video...

37
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,986
Florist.

38
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,074
Hey.

39
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,326
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey, Phoebe.

40
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,037
Ugh, you won't believe
who moved back to town.

41
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,580
- I know. Amanda.
- Ugh.

42
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,000
- She called me too. She's the worst.
- Who's Amanda?

43
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,920
She's this girl who lived in the building
before you did.

44
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:36,381
Then she moved to England
and picked up this fake British accent.

45
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,175
On the machine, this is her message:

46
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:43,096
"Um, Monica,
darling, it's Amanda calling."

47
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,892
Are you trying to do a British accent?

48
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,939
Chandler gets pedicures.

49
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,361
Just so I know, how many more
of those can I expect?

50
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,988
Know what Amanda said
when she called me?

51
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,033
"Oh, so sorry
to catch you on your mobile."

52
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:09,081
If you didn't wanna get me on my mobile,
then don't call me on my mobile.

53
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,126
And she always brags about
all the famous people she's met.

54
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,753
Oh, I know.

55
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,798
"Uh, I slept with Billy Joel."

56
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,759
All right, who hasn't?

57
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,553
Oh, what are we gonna do?
I don't wanna see her.

58
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,389
Oh, let's just cut her out.

59
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,308
- What?
- Cut her out of our lives.

60
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:32,020
Just ignore her calls
and dodge her till she gets the point.

61
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:36,275
Well, I guess we could try that.
But it seems so harsh.

62
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:40,195
- Have you ever done that?
- No. Had it done to me, though.

63
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,614
Feels good.

64
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,372
All right, Mr. Geller, right this way.

65
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,794
So how dark do you wanna be?
We have one, two or three.

66
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,213
Well, uh, I like how you look.
What are you?

67
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,008
- Puerto Rican.
- Two. I think a two.

68
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,220
You'll face the red light.

69
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,974
When the light's on, the spraying's
about to start, so close your eyes.

70
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,935
When the spraying stops,
count to five...

71
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:16,148
...pat yourself to avoid drip marks,
then turn to get your back. Got it?

72
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,652
Spray, count, pat and turn.
Spray, count and pat.

73
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,407
- Wow, you catch on quick.
- Well, I have a Ph.D., so...

74
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,766
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi, three...

75
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:57,397
Wait, wait!
I'm not... I'm not finished counting.

76
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,862
You sprayed my front twice.

77
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,282
- You never turned?
- No. I barely got to "three Mississippi."

78
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,078
Mississippi? I said count to five.

79
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,497
Mississippi-lessly?

80
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,084
Well, how bad is it?

81
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:20,504
Not that bad yet. But it gets
darker for the next four hours.

82
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,214
So how dark will it get?

83
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,299
Oh, you got sprayed
with two twos and...

84
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,426
I'm a four?

85
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,555
Yeah, but your back's a zero.
You'll wanna even that out.

86
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,516
Really?

87
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,811
- You might wanna get back in there.
- Oh, okay.

88
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,823
Wait a minute,
there's no light on the back wall.

89
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,785
How do I know
when it's gonna start? Hello?

90
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,996
My eyes!

91
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,345
The same thing happened again!

92
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,390
- You got two more twos?
- I'm an eight.

93
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,313
Thanks for dinner.

94
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,150
I thought you paid.

95
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:28,363
Heh. Guess we won't be going
back there, ha, ha.

96
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,783
- So...
- Yeah.

97
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:46,047
Hey, what do you say we, uh, move this
onto the likes of the couch?

98
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,134
I say cheesy line, but okay.

99
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,865
- What's the matter?
- I don't know. I'm sorry.

100
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,951
- I don't know why I did that.
- Okay.

101
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,455
Okay. Sorry.

102
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,802
I'm sorry. Again, I don't know
what happened. I must be nervous.

103
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,138
I don't get it. Chandler loved it.

104
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,100
Okay.

105
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:43,146
I promise. I won't do it again.
I really do. This is gonna be great.

106
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,066
- Okay.
- Okay.

107
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:04,376
Uh, was that good for you?

108
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,882
No, don't get it.
Let the machine pick up.

109
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:14,553
Oh, yeah, it could be Rachel asking
if someone could babysit again.

110
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:20,433
- It could be Amanda.
- Oh, you're right. Oh.

111
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:24,771
I was just kidding about Rachel.
Babysitting's a gas.

112
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,359
Hello, Monica. It's Amanda calling again.

113
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,237
I'm in the neighborhood,
hoping I could pop by your flat.

114
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:36,575
You're from Yonkers.
Your last name is Buffamonteezi.

115
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,661
Let's see.
So should you get this directly...

116
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,329
...ring me back on my mobile.

117
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,623
Okay, don't hold thy breath.

118
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,837
Hello? Is someone on the line?

119
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,505
Yes. I was looking for Monica.

120
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,633
Hang on, she's right here.

121
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,180
- Someone's on the phone for you.
- We weren't picking up. It's Amanda.

122
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,602
I get pedicures.

123
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,565
Hi, Amanda.

124
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:14,613
Uh, actually, now is not a good time.

125
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,532
- Dinner tomorrow night?
- No.

126
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,118
Okay, Phoebe and I will see you then.

127
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,787
Why? Why?
Why didn't you just say no?

128
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:26,541
Well, I said no to her coming over now.
I couldn't say no twice.

129
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,336
I got this uncontrollable need
to please people.

130
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,841
Fine. Fine. You would not
hold up well under torture.

131
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,344
- Oh, and you would?
- I did.

132
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:44,017
- Rach, are you sure you wanna do this?
- Absolutely.

133
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,478
It's just a little weird.
It's you, and it's me.

134
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,855
- It'll just take some getting used to.
- Okay.

135
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,317
Okay, well, uh,
how can we make it easier?

136
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,488
Okay. Let's work from the top down.

137
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,330
- Just work the bra, Joe.
- Okay, got it, yeah. Absolutely.

138
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,668
- Okay, ha, ha.
- Okay.

139
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,184
- Is this thing welded shut? Ha, ha.
- Okay.

140
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,394
All right, turn around.

141
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,896
- I gotta get a look at this thing.
- Oh.

142
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,570
- Ow!
- Sorry.

143
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,367
Well, this is romantic.

144
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,120
I'm sorry. This has never
happened to me before.

145
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,289
I'm an expert at taking off bras.
I could do it with one hand.

146
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,459
I could do it with my eyes closed.
Once I just looked at one...

147
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,962
...and it popped open.

148
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:58,591
- I blame your bra.
- It's a standard-issue bra clasp.

149
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,929
Then I blame you. Yeah. That's right.
You threw me off with all your slapping.

150
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:07,142
Okay, look, I'm really sorry
about that, Joey.

151
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:13,857
But do you think maybe, on some level,
you don't want to take off my bra?

152
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,486
No, I don't have another level.

153
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,546
Hold on. There's something different.

154
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,801
I went to that tanning place
your wife suggested.

155
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,096
Was that place the sun?

156
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,559
Oh, and it gets worse.

157
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:57,108
Oh, my God, you can do a duet
of "Ebony and lvory" all by yourself.

158
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,446
How could you mess this up?
It's so easy.

159
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,407
You go in the booth,
count to five and turn around.

160
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,910
- How do you count to five?
- One, two, three...

161
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,661
Damn it!

162
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,582
- I know!
- Ha-ha-ha.

163
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,296
Oh, what is up
with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?

164
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,257
How was your date with Joey?

165
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:26,012
Well, it was good,
until we got back to our apartment.

166
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,849
And then we were fooling around and
he started to put his hand up my leg...

167
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,684
...and I kept slapping it away.

168
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,186
You didn't like that?

169
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,982
Well, it wasn't just me, all right?
He freaked out too.

170
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,901
He couldn't even undo my bra.

171
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,488
Wow, really? One time he just looked
at my bra and it popped open.

172
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,202
I do not know what's wrong with us.

173
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,704
We've kissed before
and that's been great.

174
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,957
But this time
it was leading somewhere...

175
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,627
...and I was very aware of the fact
that it was Joey touching me.

176
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,712
You guys have been friends forever.

177
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,423
The first time you kissed Ross
was weird.

178
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,050
- Mm-hm.
- You couldn't stop laughing.

179
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,677
- You got through that.
- Mm-hm.

180
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,264
Okay. That's true.
That's true, we can do this.

181
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,767
You're right. We can do this.
We'll just power through.

182
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,144
Hey, uh, Chandler, can I talk to you
for a second?

183
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:18,940
No need, problem solved.
We are powering through.

184
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,700
Chandler, stop.
It's not going to pop open.

185
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,451
You don't know.

186
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,124
- Hi, Phoebe.
- Hey.

187
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,543
- Is Amanda here yet?
- No.

188
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:42,672
I'm sorry for screwing up that "cutting
her out" plan, but I have a new plan.

189
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,967
Chandler will call in a few minutes
with an emergency.

190
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,262
Oh, okay, what kind of emergency
gets us both out of here?

191
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:53,141
What do you think of Mike and Chandler
being in a car accident?

192
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,436
- Are you kidding? I love it.
- Okay.

193
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,231
- Hi. Ha, ha.
- Hi.

194
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,859
Hello.

195
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,195
- It's so nice to see you.
- Ha, ha.

196
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:10,450
Both of you, look at me.
Look how young I look.

197
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,038
Oh, gosh, we have
so much to catch up on.

198
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:20,543
But first things first. Touch my abs.
I don't exercise at all.

199
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,546
Oh, gosh. So, Monica, you're married.

200
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:28,009
- Yeah, his name is Chandler and he's...
- Oh, smell my neck.

201
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,473
It's not perfume. It's me.
It's my natural scent.

202
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,352
- Musty.
- Oh.

203
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:42,482
Gosh, this is brilliant.
Gosh, it's just like old times.

204
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,318
I'm so happy you two
are friends again.

205
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,738
- When were we not friends?
- Well, it was 1992.

206
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:53,701
And I remember, because that was the
year I had sex with Evel Knievel. Ha, ha.

207
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,829
Uh, we were friends in 1992.

208
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:00,166
No, I distinctly remember
you were dodging her calls...

209
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,502
...and trying to avoid seeing her.

210
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,757
- You were going to cut me out?
- Well, kind of.

211
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,884
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, bugger.

212
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:15,598
Should I not have said that? Unh!
I feel like a perfect arse.

213
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,019
Well, in America, you're just an ass.

214
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,401
Hello?

215
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,486
Chandler, what's wrong?

216
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,865
Oh, my God, are you all right?
Yeah, I'll be right there.

217
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:36,202
Oh, I'm so sorry,
but Chandler was in a car accident.

218
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,954
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

219
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,915
- Was Mike with him?
- Nope.

220
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,878
- Hey.
- Hi.

221
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,548
- Got the champagne?
- Yes. Ready to power through.

222
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,676
Excellent. Put it on ice,
the phone is off the hook...

223
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,638
...and, in the interest
of powering through...

224
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,479
Okay, sexy, sexy.

225
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,524
Very sexy, sexy.

226
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:10,153
- All right, let's do it.
- Okay, you're scaring me a little bit.

227
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,406
- Oh, get over it, soldier, we gotta do this.
- Okay.

228
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,909
- Okay. Ha, ha, you like that, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

229
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:20,371
You like that?
Let's kick this into high gear, huh?

230
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,081
Oh. Oh.

231
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,208
Yeah, baby.
I'll show you how we do it.

232
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,710
No, no, no.

233
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,628
You kneed me in my misters.

234
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:32,633
What? Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

235
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,636
Joey? Are you okay?

236
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,310
Soldier down.

237
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,316
We are not friends
with Phoebe anymore.

238
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:53,154
If she asks,
I protested a little, but okay.

239
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:58,117
Oh, Chandler, thank God you're alive.
Monica, can I talk to you outside?

240
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:03,998
- I have nothing to say to you.
- Wow. My flat is twice this size.

241
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,293
Please, Monica, in the hall?

242
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:13,257
Ooh, that accident
must have been terrible.

243
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,803
You look positively ghastly.

244
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,140
Well, aren't you a treat.

245
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:25,436
I can't believe you tried to cut me out.
Why, Phoebe? Why?

246
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,897
It was right after
we were living together...

247
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,941
...and you were driving me crazy,
okay?

248
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,903
You were really controlling
and compulsive and shrill.

249
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,031
Well, I'm still all those things.

250
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:42,036
You're also so generous
and kind and scrappy.

251
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,833
I am scrappy.

252
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,462
Exactly. No matter what I tried to do,
I couldn't keep you out of my life.

253
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,256
Of all the people I've cut out...

254
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,717
...you were the only one
who ever clawed her way back in.

255
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,930
That's because I'm scrappy.

256
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,475
Yeah, you are, and I'm so glad that
you fought your way back in...

257
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,145
...because I don't know what
I would do without you.

258
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,355
I don't know what
I would do without you.

259
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,731
Oh.

260
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:19,198
Well, I guess we should go back in.
I mean, you gave me another chance.

261
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:23,411
- We should do the same for Amanda.
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

262
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:35,047
Can you believe it? I've never had
any professional dance training.

263
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,057
Let me explain how this works.
Go in the booth and...

264
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:49,979
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Glenda. Okay? Ha, ha.

265
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,899
Does it look like this is
my first time, huh?

266
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:58,404
Now, I want four two's,
and I want them all on my back.

267
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,698
Okay.

268
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:19,467
Wait. There's two sets of nozzles.
Which one is it? Which one is it?

269
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,804
Oh, son of a bitch!

270
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,980
What is the matter with us?

271
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,025
Well, I know what's
the matter with me.

272
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:40,655
No, I mean with us, you know?
I mean, is it supposed to be this...

273
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,782
...difficult?

274
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,369
I don't know.

275
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:50,998
That fake British woman's a real bitch,
but she sure can dance.

276
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,541
- Hey.
- Hi.

277
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:56,921
Hey, listen, can I ask you a question?
When you and Monica first hooked up...

278
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:01,801
...was it weird going from friends
to more than that?

279
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,638
Kind of. Sneaking around,
having to hide from you guys...

280
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,015
No, no, no. No, I mean...

281
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,850
...sexually.

282
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:14,981
Yeah, uh, was there a part
of you that felt like it was...

283
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,400
...really wrong?

284
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,363
Actually, no.
No, it felt right, you know?

285
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,948
If felt like, uh:

286
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,826
"I can't believe we haven't
been doing this the whole time."

287
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:32,373
I can tell from your expressions that's
the good news you were hoping for.

288
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:39,880
Well, I'm gonna go continue
to spread the joy.

289
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,765
Just because it happened that way
for them doesn't mean it has to for us.

290
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,600
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

291
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,271
I mean, just because something's
difficult doesn't mean that you quit.

292
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,148
- Right, totally.
- Yeah. And so...

293
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:01,193
...we'll just keep trying
and trying until we do it.

294
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,904
If not, we'll just be a couple
that never has sex.

295
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,698
That's a plan.

296
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:24,383
- I did not see this coming.
- I know.

297
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:29,388
I don't know, I don't get it. I mean,
I was so sure this is what I wanted.

298
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,307
Mm-hm.

299
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,434
Me too.

300
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,858
Well, how come Monica and Chandler
could do it?

301
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:50,951
I guess they weren't
as good friends as we are.

302
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,038
Aw.

303
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,458
- I bet you're right.
- Hmm.

304
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,131
So...

305
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,428
Yeah.

306
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,349
I love you.

307
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,310
Love you too.

308
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:21,315
- All right, I'm going to bed.
- Yeah, me too.

309
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:27,363
Yeah. I'm not going anywhere
for a while.

310
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:40,751
- It's Chandler. Let me in.
- Go away.

311
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,587
I don't wanna see anybody.

312
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,715
I went to the tanning place
and the same thing happened to me.

313
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,050
Let me in.

314
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,802
Really?

315
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,013
Did you count Mississippi-ly?

316
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,933
You're not tan.

317
00:23:56,101 --> 00:24:02,148
No. I just had to get a picture of this.
I'll see you later.
