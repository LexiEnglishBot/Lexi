1
00:00:02,314 --> 00:00:04,908
Chandler! Chandler!

2
00:00:08,487 --> 00:00:10,921
l saw what you were doing
in the window!

3
00:00:11,123 --> 00:00:14,149
l saw what you're doing to my sister!
Get out here!

4
00:00:15,427 --> 00:00:17,657
Listen, we had a good run.

5
00:00:17,996 --> 00:00:20,226
What was it?
Four, five months?

6
00:00:20,432 --> 00:00:23,492
That's more than most people
have in a lifetime. Goodbye.

7
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:28,501
-What are you doing?
-l am going on the lam.

8
00:00:28,907 --> 00:00:31,671
Come on, Chandler.
l can handle Ross.

9
00:00:32,277 --> 00:00:33,767
Hold on!

10
00:00:36,848 --> 00:00:38,440
Hey, Ross.
What's up, bro?

11
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:44,652
What the hell are you doing?

12
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:45,912
What's going on?

13
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:50,184
l think Ross knows
about me and Monica.

14
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,924
Dude, he's right there.

15
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:59,195
l thought you were my best friend!
This is my sister!

16
00:00:59,504 --> 00:01:02,473
My best friend and my sister!
l cannot believe this!

17
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:06,474
We're not just messing around.
l love her.

18
00:01:06,878 --> 00:01:08,436
l'm in love with her.

19
00:01:09,881 --> 00:01:12,509
l'm so sorry that you
had to find out this way.

20
00:01:13,518 --> 00:01:16,783
l'm sorry, but it's true.
l love him too.

21
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:25,721
My best friend and my sister!

22
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:31,028
l cannot believe this!

23
00:01:33,305 --> 00:01:36,741
You guys want to probably
get some hugs in too. Big news!

24
00:01:38,243 --> 00:01:40,302
We've actually known for a while.

25
00:01:44,716 --> 00:01:46,911
What? You guys knew?

26
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:49,810
You all knew and
you didn't tell me?

27
00:01:50,088 --> 00:01:55,219
We were worried about you. We didn't
know how you were going to react.

28
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,097
You were worried about me?

29
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:03,701
You didn't know how l'd react?

30
00:02:06,838 --> 00:02:09,102
Okay. All right.

31
00:02:09,374 --> 00:02:13,401
Let's clear out of here and let
these lovebirds get back to business.

32
00:02:16,748 --> 00:02:20,411
l'm just talking here.
He's the one doing your sister.

33
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:25,716
The One With the Girl Who Hits Joey

34
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:02,555
You know what l just realized?

35
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:04,228
lf you guys have kids--

36
00:03:04,496 --> 00:03:05,724
We're having kids?

37
00:03:05,897 --> 00:03:07,091
l call godfather!

38
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:11,993
You can't just call godfather.

39
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:15,138
Shouldn't her brother be godfather?

40
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,808
Sure. lf you cared enough
to call it first.

41
00:03:19,411 --> 00:03:23,677
-You're a few steps ahead of us.
-Big zero gravity moon steps.

42
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:27,016
l just thought of
the greatest wedding gift.

43
00:03:27,285 --> 00:03:29,913
l'll go in on that with you.
l couldn't decide.

44
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:33,819
Hey, Katie.

45
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,421
This is Katie.

46
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:36,983
You ready to go?

47
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:38,992
l'll run to the bathroom.

48
00:03:39,297 --> 00:03:40,286
Where's lunch?

49
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:42,329
l was thinking Chinese food.

50
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:44,000
l love Chinese!

51
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:46,829
How did you know l love Chinese?

52
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:51,975
She is so cute.

53
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,201
You could fit her
in your pocket.

54
00:03:56,114 --> 00:03:59,948
She could fit in that little pocket
inside the pocket.

55
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:04,879
l don't know. l like her a lot,
and she's really nice, but....

56
00:04:05,123 --> 00:04:06,647
But what?

57
00:04:08,393 --> 00:04:10,293
She keeps punching me.

58
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,228
ln the cute, little
sweet way she just did?

59
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:17,992
lt's a lot harder than it looks.

60
00:04:19,137 --> 00:04:21,571
She's hurting me.

61
00:04:22,073 --> 00:04:24,769
l know what you need.
You need a bodyguard.

62
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,978
What is Ben doing after preschool?

63
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:33,479
Joey is having a problem.
A little girl is beating him up.

64
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:36,413
Joey, come here.

65
00:04:36,655 --> 00:04:40,022
Honey, l know. This must be
really difficult for you, and--

66
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:41,952
l'm sorry, am l hurting you?

67
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:55,832
l brought you some housewarming gifts.

68
00:04:56,107 --> 00:04:58,473
Salt, so your life always has flavor.

69
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:01,805
Bread, so you never go hungry.

70
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:05,009
And a scented candle for the bathroom.

71
00:05:05,283 --> 00:05:06,807
Because, well, you know.

72
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:12,214
Thanks. Thanks.
And thanks, l guess.

73
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:18,022
Welcome. l'm Steve Cera,
president of the tenants' committee.

74
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,131
Ross Geller.
And this is my friend Phoebe.

75
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:23,864
Mr. President.

76
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:27,396
l came to talk to you
about Howard.

77
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:31,342
He is the handyman
who's retiring next week.

78
00:05:31,543 --> 00:05:36,412
Everyone who lives here is kicking in
$ 1 00 as a kind of a thank you.

79
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:38,046
That's nice.

80
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:39,806
Want to give me a check?

81
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:46,557
Not now. You can
slip it under my door.

82
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:48,520
No, it's not that.

83
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,422
l just moved in.

84
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,558
Well, the guy's worked here
for 25 years.

85
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:58,327
Yes, but l've lived here
for 25 minutes.

86
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,231
Okay, l get it.

87
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:09,273
Wait! Look, l'm sorry, it's just
l've never even met Howard.

88
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:11,913
l mean, l don't know Howard.

89
00:06:12,183 --> 00:06:14,777
Howard's the handyman.

90
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:19,721
Yes, but to me, he's just ''man.''

91
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:23,360
Okay. Fine. Whatever.

92
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:26,062
Welcome to the building.

93
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,759
Can you believe that guy?

94
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:33,366
l really like his glasses.

95
00:06:38,877 --> 00:06:42,142
So then President Steve
told everyone l was a cheapskate...

96
00:06:42,447 --> 00:06:44,415
...and now the whole building hates me.

97
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:47,107
A little kid spit on my knee.

98
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,318
And told me to wipe it off
with my $ 1 00 bill.

99
00:06:52,624 --> 00:06:54,922
You really should wipe it off
with something.

100
00:06:57,629 --> 00:06:58,618
You know what?

101
00:06:58,863 --> 00:07:02,094
l'll throw a party.
For everyone in the building.

102
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:07,265
And l'll sit them all down and
explain that l am not a bad guy.

103
00:07:07,505 --> 00:07:10,303
l am not a cheap guy.
l'm just a guy...

104
00:07:10,575 --> 00:07:12,805
...who stands up
for what he believes in.

105
00:07:13,144 --> 00:07:15,544
A man with principles.

106
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,543
Sounds like a fun party.

107
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:23,314
lf you want them to like you,
why don't you just pay the $ 1 00?

108
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:25,284
The party will cost you more.

109
00:07:25,557 --> 00:07:26,785
That doesn't matter!

110
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:30,761
lt's my principles!
We're talking about my principles!

111
00:07:31,162 --> 00:07:34,393
l thought it was about
your neighbors liking you.

112
00:07:34,632 --> 00:07:38,466
They'll like me once
they come to my awesome party.

113
00:07:40,438 --> 00:07:42,065
l gotta get some nametags.

114
00:07:46,077 --> 00:07:49,513
And that crazy party animal
will be your brother-in-law.

115
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:53,617
Very funny.
But don't say that to Monica.

116
00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:56,082
Don't put any ideas in her head.

117
00:07:56,588 --> 00:08:01,025
You do realize that those ideas
are probably already in Monica's head?

118
00:08:01,693 --> 00:08:03,160
Why?

119
00:08:04,496 --> 00:08:08,330
Well, because she loves you
and because you love her.

120
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,930
Yeah, so? What's
that supposed to mean?

121
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,704
Don't freak out! l'm telling you
something you already know.

122
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,068
She left Richard because
he didn't want to have babies.

123
00:08:19,277 --> 00:08:24,146
And she is a woman. And she's
almost 30. And, you know, it's Monica.

124
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:27,011
l don't see it that way.
l see two Monicas.

125
00:08:27,285 --> 00:08:30,880
My friend who lives across
the hall and wants a lot of babies.

126
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:34,290
And the new Monica
who l started to date.

127
00:08:34,526 --> 00:08:37,359
Now, who is to say what she wants?

128
00:08:38,396 --> 00:08:39,886
l'm right.

129
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:41,898
Am l right?

130
00:08:43,668 --> 00:08:45,101
Oh, absolutely.

131
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,238
l'm completely different from Richard.

132
00:08:47,405 --> 00:08:50,636
He's an eye doctor,
and l don't wear glasses.

133
00:08:53,178 --> 00:08:54,167
You're right.

134
00:08:54,546 --> 00:08:58,175
You're absolutely right.
That makes everything different.

135
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:00,882
lt's not different, is it?

136
00:09:01,186 --> 00:09:03,313
Not unless different
means ''the same.''

137
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,486
You were so funny with that waiter.
You're such a nut!

138
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:18,335
You know, bread-stick fangs
are always funny.

139
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,664
No, you make them funny.
You're the funny one!

140
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:27,837
Look, Katie.
Listen, we need to talk, okay?

141
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,138
Look, l like you.
l really do. l like you a lot.

142
00:09:33,218 --> 00:09:36,585
But sometimes when you
playfully punch me like that...

143
00:09:36,855 --> 00:09:42,020
...it feels like l'm being hit
with a very tiny but a very real bat!

144
00:09:44,863 --> 00:09:46,694
Like l could hurt you.

145
00:09:46,898 --> 00:09:48,763
Are you making fun of my size?

146
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,936
Don't make fun of me
because of my size!

147
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:00,172
lsn't this great?

148
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:03,506
Couldn't you just
stay like this forever?

149
00:10:08,353 --> 00:10:10,287
Couldn't you just stay here forever?

150
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:14,355
Yeah, here, somewhere else.
You know, wherever.

151
00:10:15,627 --> 00:10:16,616
Are you okay?

152
00:10:17,128 --> 00:10:18,254
l'm cool.

153
00:10:18,563 --> 00:10:19,928
Casual.

154
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:22,196
What are you doing?

155
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,934
Just hanging out. Having fun
with the girl that l'm seeing casually.

156
00:10:28,706 --> 00:10:31,266
Man, l knew it!
l knew you'd do this.

157
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:32,431
What?

158
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,205
Get all freaked out because
everybody was joking about marriage!

159
00:10:36,814 --> 00:10:39,874
Well, you do want
all that stuff, right?

160
00:10:40,118 --> 00:10:41,585
You know what l want?

161
00:10:41,786 --> 00:10:44,755
Yes! You want babies!
You have baby fever!

162
00:10:46,224 --> 00:10:47,919
l do not have baby fever!

163
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,992
You're obsessed
with babies and marriage...

164
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:54,788
...and everything that's
related to babies and marriage.

165
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,661
Why don't we turn the heat
down on this pressure cooker!

166
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:02,936
Have you lost your mind?

167
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:07,405
This isn't about me. This is about
you and your weird commitment crap!

168
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:12,105
l know you. l know the thoughts
that you have in your head.

169
00:11:13,017 --> 00:11:14,484
You don't know everything.

170
00:11:14,752 --> 00:11:18,188
Did you know l'm going out
with Rachel tonight instead of you?

171
00:11:18,423 --> 00:11:20,482
And that the only baby here is you?

172
00:11:20,692 --> 00:11:23,786
Did you know l can't even
look at you now?

173
00:11:26,331 --> 00:11:27,491
l did not know that.

174
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:37,232
lt'll be okay, right?
She won't leave me. This is fixable.

175
00:11:37,508 --> 00:11:39,499
-Yeah, sure.
-Absolutely.

176
00:11:39,777 --> 00:11:40,835
By me?

177
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:47,684
Unless you make some big gesture.

178
00:11:47,852 --> 00:11:48,841
Big, though.

179
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:51,611
The missus!

180
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,855
Gunther, can l get a coffee?

181
00:11:57,028 --> 00:11:58,017
To go.

182
00:11:59,864 --> 00:12:01,798
l still don't want to talk to you.

183
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,364
Tell me how to make things right.

184
00:12:05,036 --> 00:12:06,367
That's what we do.

185
00:12:06,571 --> 00:12:09,631
l mess up, you tell me
how to fix it and l do.

186
00:12:09,907 --> 00:12:12,307
And then you think l'm cute again.

187
00:12:13,945 --> 00:12:16,937
l'm really tired of being
your relationship tutor.

188
00:12:17,148 --> 00:12:19,116
Figure this out for yourself.

189
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:22,878
lf you're afraid
of a real relationship...

190
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:25,055
...then don't be in one.

191
00:13:03,127 --> 00:13:05,789
Howard! Howard! Howard!

192
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:20,140
Hi, Ross!

193
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:22,846
What are you doing here?

194
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:26,777
l thought this was your party,
and it's a party for Howard.

195
00:13:27,018 --> 00:13:28,986
He's the sweetest little man.

196
00:13:30,121 --> 00:13:33,056
See you, Phoebe.
And thanks for chipping in.

197
00:13:33,324 --> 00:13:34,723
Oh, sure.

198
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:37,150
You chipped in?

199
00:13:37,362 --> 00:13:38,852
Yeah, $ 1 00.

200
00:13:39,497 --> 00:13:42,022
l can't believe you gave him money.

201
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:46,499
l thought you agreed it was unreasonable
that they asked me for that money.

202
00:13:46,704 --> 00:13:48,001
But they didn't ask me.

203
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:52,839
l'm just the exotic, generous stranger.
That's always fun to be.

204
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:55,671
But you're making me look bad.

205
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,043
No, l'm not! lf anything,
l'm making you look better.

206
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,651
They'll see you
talking to me. l'm a hit.

207
00:14:03,421 --> 00:14:05,321
Hey, Pheebs!

208
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,148
Hey, Ross.

209
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:09,722
Maybe you two could
switch apartments.

210
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:12,555
Because Phoebe is more
our kind of people.

211
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,058
Think about it.

212
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:19,564
Okay, my bad.

213
00:14:35,853 --> 00:14:38,219
You look big.

214
00:14:38,623 --> 00:14:40,591
Thanks, l've been working out.

215
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:44,357
Listen, is it obvious
l'm wearing six sweaters?

216
00:14:46,964 --> 00:14:49,125
But it's not obvious why.

217
00:14:49,634 --> 00:14:53,070
l'm breaking up with Katie,
so l put on some extra padding.

218
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:57,469
lf she hits me when she is happy,
can you imagine how hard she'll hit...

219
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,233
...when l take away the Joey love?

220
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:05,112
Oh, right. l forgot that you call it that.

221
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:12,016
Hey, cute jacket.

222
00:15:12,256 --> 00:15:13,746
Thanks.

223
00:15:14,025 --> 00:15:16,186
-That's so sweet!
-Ouch!

224
00:15:20,164 --> 00:15:24,567
Did Joey tell you to say that?
You guys are too much!

225
00:15:26,604 --> 00:15:29,072
You know what?
l gotta tell you...

226
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,002
...l think you're the one
that is too much.

227
00:15:34,045 --> 00:15:36,343
Joey has the nicest friends.

228
00:15:37,114 --> 00:15:39,582
And the nicest girlfriend.

229
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:43,019
You're so sweet!

230
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:46,112
You're so sweet!

231
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:55,531
She just kicked me.

232
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:02,895
Aren't you going to do something?

233
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,208
Do something or l'll walk
out that door right now.

234
00:16:09,614 --> 00:16:11,138
Are you going to?

235
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:36,501
This is a disaster.
Can't l please just go?

236
00:16:36,774 --> 00:16:38,503
l'm talking you up to people.

237
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:41,404
Give it some time, relax.
Get something to eat.

238
00:16:46,117 --> 00:16:47,982
What did you tell them about me?

239
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:51,744
l told them about you and Emily.
Trying to get some sympathy.

240
00:16:52,023 --> 00:16:54,116
But you came off as the bad guy.

241
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,454
l told it wrong.

242
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:03,297
We should talk about that because
l don't understand what happened there.

243
00:17:05,803 --> 00:17:07,361
This cake is really good!

244
00:17:08,172 --> 00:17:09,605
Things are looking up.

245
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,174
Oh, my God!
Someone cut Howard's cake!

246
00:17:17,815 --> 00:17:20,375
Who would do a thing like that?

247
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,484
3B.

248
00:17:29,894 --> 00:17:32,727
You got your free food.
You ruined everyone's fun.

249
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:34,692
lsn't it time you went home?

250
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:39,567
Go back to 3B, 3B.

251
00:17:40,638 --> 00:17:44,506
Everyone, calm down!
l have something that l'd like to say.

252
00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:48,871
Who here likes Ross?

253
00:17:54,085 --> 00:17:55,643
Of course you don't like him.

254
00:17:55,886 --> 00:17:57,649
He didn't give you any money.

255
00:17:57,989 --> 00:18:01,322
He raised his own hand
when l asked, ''Who likes Ross?''

256
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,659
And he's wearing two nametags.

257
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:10,934
l'll be honest. When l first met Ross,
l didn't like him at all.

258
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:16,537
Once l got to know him,
l saw that he is really sweet...

259
00:18:16,841 --> 00:18:20,174
...and caring and very generous.

260
00:18:20,411 --> 00:18:24,211
All l'm saying is, don't judge
Ross before you get to know him.

261
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:29,351
You know, l like all of you guys now.
But when l first met you, you know?

262
00:18:29,587 --> 00:18:31,885
Kurt? l thought, abrasive drunk.

263
00:18:34,258 --> 00:18:35,247
Lola?

264
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:37,720
Mind-numbingly stupid.

265
00:18:40,598 --> 00:18:43,726
You guys. Gold digger,
cradle-robbing perv.

266
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:49,234
So l think you all know what l mean.

267
00:18:55,746 --> 00:18:58,738
Obviously, l didn't think
they would throw things.

268
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:03,817
l thought if l kept insulting them
you'd defend them.

269
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:06,046
Then you'd look like the hero.

270
00:19:08,893 --> 00:19:10,656
See, l did not get that.

271
00:19:15,232 --> 00:19:18,258
Where's Monica? l need
to talk to her, it's urgent.

272
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,298
l'm Monica.

273
00:19:20,504 --> 00:19:22,597
l need to talk to you. lt's urgent.

274
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:25,306
l've been thinking...

275
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:29,306
...about us. A lot of ''us'' thinking.

276
00:19:31,015 --> 00:19:33,643
l guess there's
only one way to do this.

277
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:39,688
What are you doing?

278
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:42,086
Don't do it.

279
00:19:42,493 --> 00:19:43,858
Will you marry me?

280
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:50,198
What a bad idea.

281
00:19:50,468 --> 00:19:52,436
l can't not look at it.

282
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:56,335
Why are you doing this?

283
00:19:56,607 --> 00:19:58,040
l don't know.

284
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:01,143
But l know l'm not afraid to do this.

285
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:05,838
l'm doing this because l'm sorry?

286
00:20:08,185 --> 00:20:12,519
Do you think the best reason
to get married is because you're sorry?

287
00:20:12,723 --> 00:20:14,657
The best reason is pregnancy.

288
00:20:18,395 --> 00:20:23,298
Sorry is fourth, behind being ready
and actually wanting to get married.

289
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:25,692
Will you be my wife?

290
00:20:29,306 --> 00:20:33,743
l want you to take a minute and think
about how ridiculous this sounds.

291
00:20:37,548 --> 00:20:40,176
l'm kind of wishing
everyone wasn't here now.

292
00:20:43,354 --> 00:20:45,015
None of that came from me.

293
00:20:45,256 --> 00:20:48,817
l never said l wanted to have babies
and get married!

294
00:20:49,093 --> 00:20:52,256
l was really confused.
Then l talked to these guys.

295
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,828
Who? Two divorces and Joey?

296
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:58,358
She's right, you know?

297
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:02,905
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!

298
00:21:04,742 --> 00:21:07,575
You know when l said
that l want you...

299
00:21:07,845 --> 00:21:10,905
...to deal with relationship stuff
all on your own?

300
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:12,343
You're not ready.

301
00:21:13,017 --> 00:21:14,780
l didn't think l was!

302
00:21:19,723 --> 00:21:20,712
Oh, my God.

303
00:21:21,258 --> 00:21:23,886
What would you have done
if l had said yes?

304
00:21:24,128 --> 00:21:26,062
l would've been happy because...

305
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:30,028
...l would spend the rest of
my life with the woman l love.

306
00:21:31,268 --> 00:21:34,567
Or you would have seen
a Chandler-shaped hole in that door.

307
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,043
Will you pass that knife?

308
00:21:41,345 --> 00:21:43,040
No, l will not.

309
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,510
You don't have to be mean about it.

310
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,819
You're right. l'm sorry.
Will you marry me?

311
00:21:52,656 --> 00:21:57,116
l was going to ask you to marry me
because l didn't say hello to you.

312
00:21:58,362 --> 00:22:02,196
Or ask them to move in with you.
But l'm not sure. Chandler?

313
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:04,857
How long is this going to go on?

314
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:07,126
l think the length of teasing...

315
00:22:07,338 --> 00:22:11,707
...is directly related to how insane
you were. So a long time.

316
00:22:12,343 --> 00:22:13,332
This is fun!

317
00:22:13,677 --> 00:22:16,009
Remember that
''we were on a break'' thing?

318
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:18,408
l'm sorry.
Will you marry me?

319
00:22:24,054 --> 00:22:25,487
That's not funny.
