1
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:07,381
Are you looking
at naked tribeswomen?

2
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:10,009
No, look.

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,344
That's a pig.

4
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,347
I know.
But look at the knobs on it!

5
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,894
- Hey.
- Hey.

6
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:23,063
Emily's cousin kicked me out.

7
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:24,523
- What?
- Why?

8
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,359
When you sublet
from your wife's cousin...

9
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:31,822
...then you divorce, sometimes
the cousin wants his apartment back.

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,532
Didn't you sign a lease?

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,201
Who needs a lease when it's "family"?

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,706
You can stay with us.

13
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,332
Anything you need.

14
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,419
But you have to let us know
when you feel better...

15
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,421
...so we can make fun of your hair.

16
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,300
- You got it.
- Okay.

17
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:56,221
Thanks, I really appreciate this.
I'm going to get packing again.

18
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,933
I've been moving around so much
that I feel like a nomad.

19
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,105
- What?
- He thought you said gonad.

20
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,579
Wow, Monica. If every place were this clean,
it'd be tough making a living.

21
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,665
Ha, oh, Larry!

22
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,751
Um, do health inspectors
work on commission?

23
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,378
No, bribes.

24
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:12,673
- Ha-ha-ha, it's okay to laugh?
- I was just kidding.

25
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,844
- I'll check the kitchen floor.
- Knock yourself out.

26
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,389
Yummy! Heh.

27
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,516
Larry?

28
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,560
Yeah, I'd let him check out
my kitchen floor.

29
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,440
A 98.

30
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,485
I deducted two points
for not wearing your hat.

31
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,529
That is a Section 5 violation.

32
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,699
Oh. Now look, Larry, honey, ha, ha.

33
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,577
Um, I wrote the book on Section 5.

34
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,371
You only need to wear it
in the kitchen.

35
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,249
- Where's your hat?
- In the kitchen. I'll get it.

36
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,085
Ah, there's the two points!

37
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,590
You should really read
that book you wrote.

38
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,638
Wow.

39
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:06,852
You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew
she'd go in hatless to get it, heh.

40
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,480
You could have your own
health inspector detective show.

41
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,025
Ah, I don't know about that.

42
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,903
But then I could be
your sidekick, Voonda, heh.

43
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,115
Maybe, uh, I could ask Voonda
to dinner sometime?

44
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,367
She would love that...

45
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,829
...since you know
all the clean places to eat, heh.

46
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,415
I'll call you.

47
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,209
Okay.

48
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,632
He's so funny! Whoa, oh.

49
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,015
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

50
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:48,894
How's Ross doing
since all the Emily stuff?

51
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,563
He's not great.
But, um, he's dealing with it.

52
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,232
- Oh.
- Wait, you're not...

53
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:57,361
Oh, I can't get started
with all that Ross stuff again.

54
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,155
He'll be screwed up for a long time.

55
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:04,076
Besides, I don't go for guys
right after they get divorced.

56
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,704
Right, you only go for them
five minutes before they get married.

57
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,712
- Two pounds of mocha java.
- It's Danny.

58
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,339
Are you going to go out again?

59
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,300
I don't know.
He hasn't called since we went out.

60
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,594
I see him in the hallway.
We flirt. I'm all...

61
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,431
...and then nothing.

62
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,850
- Hey.
- Hi, Danny.

63
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,310
Wow, thirsty, huh?

64
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,022
I'm having a party on Saturday.
Sort of a housewarming thing.

65
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,732
- Oh, fun.
- Oh, great!

66
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,734
- Really looking forward to it.
- Yeah.

67
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,444
See you!

68
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,827
So I guess we won't
be warming his house.

69
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,162
Oh, ha, ha, okay.

70
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,873
All right, I see what he's doing.

71
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:56,169
He's not asking me out
because he wants me to ask him out.

72
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,504
And you won't do that.

73
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,089
That's right!

74
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,384
Because that would give him
the control.

75
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,762
So now he comes up with this
"I've got a party" thing...

76
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,640
...to get me to hint
for an invitation.

77
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,767
Blew up in his face, didn't it? Ha.

78
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,895
So there is no party?

79
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,941
No, there's a party.
There's a party.

80
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,651
But the power?

81
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,029
That is still up for grabs.

82
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,239
You follow me?

83
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,741
I think so.

84
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,870
So he won't invite you to his party
because he likes you?

85
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,288
Exactly!

86
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,090
Ross?

87
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,135
Hey, roomies!

88
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,096
I love what you've done
with the place.

89
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,682
Oh, I know it's a lot of boxes.

90
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,853
- I appreciate you letting me stay here.
- Not a problem.

91
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,147
Since you'll be here a while...

92
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,359
...we, uh, could put your name
on the answering machine.

93
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,486
Oh, I, uh, hope you don't mind...

94
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:06,073
...but I kind of already
jazzed it up a little, ha, ha.

95
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,158
Check it out.

96
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:18,335
We will
We will call you back

97
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,214
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Oh, yes.

98
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,386
- You're fake laughing too, right?
- The tears are real.

99
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,762
Oh, yeah. Ha, ha.

100
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,518
- You look beautiful this evening.
- Heh.

101
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,686
Show me the badge again.

102
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,361
Shiny, ha, ha.

103
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,615
Oh, you mind if I wash up?
Who knows where these have been?

104
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,951
You are just nonstop, ha-ha-ha!

105
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,588
- We're out of here.
- Why?

106
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:07,676
I saw ten violations.
I'm shutting this place down!

107
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:11,513
- You have the power to do that?
- This does.

108
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,099
Shut it down.

109
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,903
Hey.

110
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,865
What are you doing?

111
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,033
Nothing.

112
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,203
You built a fort, didn't you?

113
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,416
Kind of, heh.

114
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,170
Oh, my God! The air purifier.
Ross' air purifier.

115
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,380
All I heard for four years
through college was...

116
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,760
You should have gone out
once in a while.

117
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,181
- I hate this thing!
- Come on, Chandler.

118
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,017
Ross is our friend.
He needs us right now.

119
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,479
So why don't you be a grownup
and come watch TV in the fort?

120
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,903
- Oh, hi, Danny.
- Hey, guys.

121
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,821
Uh, I wanted to invite you to the party.

122
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,073
Oh, thanks, I'll try to stop by.

123
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,869
Actually, I think, ahem,
I'm going to be busy.

124
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,287
You are?

125
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,663
Yeah.

126
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,166
Remember? I've got that, uh, gala.

127
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,628
What's the gala for?

128
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,254
Uh, it's a, um...

129
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,715
It's, uh, a regatta gala.

130
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,675
Do you sail?

131
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,720
No, but I support it.

132
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,974
I hope I see you tomorrow night.
Take care.

133
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,851
Okay.

134
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,190
Walked right into that one,
didn't he?

135
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,650
What one?

136
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,569
You wanted him to invite you
and he did.

137
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,864
He waited until the last minute.
So if I said yes...

138
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,868
...he'd know I had nothing better
to do than wait for his invitation.

139
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,411
But I said no...

140
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,456
...which puts me back
in the driver's seat.

141
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,084
So the ball is in his court?

142
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,377
Ball?

143
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,462
No, there's no ball.

144
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,849
Joey, please.

145
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,810
Sorry.

146
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,328
- Hello, children.
- Hey.

147
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,415
You want to play some foosball?
Please?

148
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,209
- Okay.
- No, no, no.

149
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:50,255
We moved the table into my room
because of all the boxes, ha, ha.

150
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,132
Come on!

151
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,639
I have one question.

152
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,726
What is the deal with this?

153
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,605
Bye-bye, little puppet Joey hand?

154
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,898
No, the quiet down thing.

155
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,443
Oh. You mean this.

156
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,403
Mm-hm.

157
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,032
I don't know how much more
I can take.

158
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:21,328
Did you know he taped over my
Baywatch tape with a show about bugs?

159
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,623
My God!

160
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,166
- What if that had been porn?
- Oh!

161
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,086
All right, this may be tough...

162
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,881
...but it's Ross.
I survived college with him.

163
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,343
I guess I can hold out
a little longer.

164
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,720
- Let's have a game.
- Okay.

165
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,389
Don't be scored on. No, no, no.

166
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,809
Yes. Ha-ha-ha.

167
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,019
Uh, fellas?

168
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,486
- So he's out of here.
- Mm-hm.

169
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,868
- Hey.
- Hey.

170
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:06,122
Got anything to eat?
I went to Jono's and it was closed.

171
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:10,877
Oh, I took Larry there, but it was all
violated, so we shut it down.

172
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:15,840
If this guy keeps closing our
favorite places, where will we eat?

173
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,759
I don't know. Clean places?

174
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,302
Mm, yum!

175
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,267
It's Danny.

176
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,770
Don't let him in!
I'm supposed to be at a gala.

177
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,315
We'll be right there.
Can't you say it's later?

178
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,111
What kind of a regatta gala
starts at night?

179
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,904
The fake kind.

180
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,745
- Um, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
- We have a ladle.

181
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,082
See you at the party.

182
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,291
Okay, great.

183
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,921
You know what Larry would say?
He'd say, "See you ladle."

184
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,763
I'm done. You want anything?
Uh, sports? International?

185
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,223
Apartment listings?

186
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,058
I'll take sports.

187
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,601
Mine!

188
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,896
All right, uh, international.

189
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,148
That's mine too.

190
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,860
I'm Italian.

191
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:22,824
I could check apartment listings,
though there's never anything here.

192
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,493
Not even on page seven?

193
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:27,996
Oh, yeah.

194
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,915
You're right.
Oh, here's an affordable place.

195
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:35,462
Two bedroom, close to work.
Ooh, it's available in five weeks.

196
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,714
What about that circled one?

197
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:42,343
Ooh, I don't know.
It's kind of expensive for a studio.

198
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,262
But it's available now.

199
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,513
Isn't it?

200
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,348
Yes, it is.

201
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,434
Let's go look at it, heh!

202
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,937
- Oh, okay. Let's go.
- There we go! Yay!

203
00:12:53,814 --> 00:13:00,278
Oh, oh, oh, guys, would you, uh, chip in
for some new air filters for the purifier?

204
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,490
I mean, after all,
we are all using it.

205
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:04,741
Let's go quicker!

206
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,326
Yeah.

207
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,298
- Oh, my God!
- Mm.

208
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:24,594
Oh, look at this kitchen/bathroom.

209
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,764
That's great!
So you can cook while in the tub.

210
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,475
Somebody was using his head.

211
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,145
Let's check out
the rest of the place.

212
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,324
I think this is it.

213
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,911
I don't know.
Maybe we should keep looking.

214
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,705
But this place is available now.

215
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,959
You don't want to be stuck
with us for five weeks.

216
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,509
So you think I should
take this place?

217
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,387
Oh, it's perfect!

218
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,559
How about you?

219
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,311
Kitchen, slash, bathroom.

220
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,149
Ah, I see what you guys are saying.

221
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:24,028
I'll, uh, go downstairs
and fill out an application.

222
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,618
We are bad people.

223
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,956
He knew we were trying
to get rid of him.

224
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,127
Could we get a bathtub
in our kitchen?

225
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,717
Ready for dinner?

226
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,927
- Ooh, absolutely.
- Great.

227
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,388
You wanted to go to
the Italian place on Bleecker St?

228
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,265
Oh, I love that place, ha, ha.

229
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,601
- So no.
- Oh.

230
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,519
How about Mama Lozetti's?

231
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,896
Yuck.

232
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,856
Sure.

233
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:03,318
How long has that milk
been sitting out?

234
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,154
No, this place is totally healthy.

235
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,948
This milk is mine.
I bought this today...

236
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,285
...because I was thirsty for milk,
you know?

237
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,499
Okay, let's go.

238
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,295
Hey, buddy.

239
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:27,675
Health Code 11 B requires that refuse
be taken out the back exit.

240
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,178
But then I have to go
all the way around.

241
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:33,097
So you choose convenience
over health?

242
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,850
Stop, Larry.

243
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:41,606
Can't you just be Larry and not
Larry the health inspector guy?

244
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,691
It was exciting at first.

245
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:48,404
But now, it's like, so where
are we going to eat ever?

246
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:52,325
I suppose I could give him a warning.

247
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,160
Thank you.

248
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,413
Go, go!

249
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,586
If, after dinner,
you still need to bust someone...

250
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,713
...I know a hot dog vendor
who picks his nose.

251
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:14,889
Maybe we did good,
helping Ross get back on his feet.

252
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,724
That was a nice place.

253
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:22,188
No closet space, but he could hang
his stuff out the window in a bag.

254
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,360
What do we do?

255
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,404
I don't know.

256
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,322
Maybe pizza?

257
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,450
- About Ross!
- Oh.

258
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,958
Hello.

259
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,543
Oh, yeah.

260
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:47,422
It's the apartment manager.
Ross put us as references.

261
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:50,842
Ross is the greatest guy.
He's very reliable...

262
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:55,513
Of course, he has a big, huge dog
that, uh, barks into the night.

263
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,892
Well, who doesn't love dogs?

264
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,937
Uh, he's a tap dancer.

265
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,858
Yes, some would say
that is a lost art.

266
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,693
He's a pimp!

267
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,864
There you go. He's a pimp.

268
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,158
He's a big, tap-dancing pimp!

269
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,536
Hello?

270
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,506
Oh.

271
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:41,017
Watching for a sound
To lead me to wherever...

272
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,312
Shh, this is never going to work.
He's right there.

273
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,688
Just go say hi.

274
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:51,486
I have to go downstairs and back up,
as if I'm coming home from the gala.

275
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:55,114
So just go distract him.
But don't be sexy.

276
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,076
- Hey, Danny.
- Hey.

277
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,285
What's going on?

278
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,830
This is a great party.
Great food, ha, ha.

279
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,794
Oh, you know, most parties, it's, uh,
all chips and salsa, chips and salsa.

280
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,089
So, um...

281
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,841
What's this?

282
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,760
Salad.

283
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,512
Oh.

284
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,098
And what's this?

285
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,934
Bread.

286
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,852
Aren't you a chef?

287
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,647
Oh.

288
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,024
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hey.

289
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,194
Oh, right, tonight was your party.

290
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,530
You look great!
I'm glad you made it.

291
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:39,492
Oh, well, you know,
the gala had to end sometime.

292
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,577
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

293
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,996
- Yeah, sure.
- All right?

294
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,708
Whose court is the ball in now?

295
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,919
I thought there wasn't a ball.

296
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,342
Come on. He's glad I came.
He doesn't want me to go anywhere.

297
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,469
Ball's flying all over the place.

298
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,681
This is my friend, Tom.

299
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,517
This is the girl I told you about.

300
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,937
Oh, come on!
You telling people about me?

301
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,648
I think you two
could really hit it off.

302
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,859
I'm gonna go mingle.

303
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,365
So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh?
My mom calls it "Bloomies."

304
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,289
Yeah, okay.

305
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,040
At ease, soldier, heh.

306
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,877
I'm sorry?

307
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:34,422
You can just drop the act.
I know what's going on.

308
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,507
You're Danny's wingman, right?

309
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,928
You guys are best buds, frat bros.

310
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,473
I'm going to go talk to, uh, a friend.

311
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,643
Yeah, you go talk to your friend.

312
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,770
Go tell him, "Nice try."

313
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,902
He just keeps lobbing them up...

314
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:59,447
...and I keep knocking them
right out of the park.

315
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,617
I think I need a drink.

316
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,285
Yeah.

317
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,916
Ninety-eight...

318
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,626
...ninety-nine...

319
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,878
...one hundred!

320
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,296
Okay. Go.

321
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:18,090
Dude, I'm telling you, I'm fine.

322
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,346
Here we go, here we go.

323
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,349
- Hey.
- Hey.

324
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:31,229
So I, uh, didn't get that apartment.
Some problem with my application.

325
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,605
You're kidding?

326
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:36,984
But Phoebe said I could stay
at her place for a while, so...

327
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,696
Well, you can't stay with Phoebe.
We're roomies.

328
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,699
You don't need me
taking up all your space.

329
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:48,412
We got plenty of space.
There's still some by that speaker.

330
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,123
Please, just stay.

331
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,667
Yeah.

332
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:53,960
Are you sure?

333
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,255
- Definitely.
- You have to stay.

334
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,634
- All right.
- All right, buddy.

335
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,762
So I'm a pimp, huh?

336
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,267
It's okay.

337
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,769
Sometimes I can be a pain in the ass.

338
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,690
But just talk to me.
Tell me if something bothers you.

339
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:22,238
And I'll do everything I can
to keep my annoying habits just...

340
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,798
Well, I see you've had
a very productive day.

341
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,259
The cowboy hat's a little much.

342
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,469
Come on, it's fun!

343
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,557
All right.

344
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,274
Isn't this a woman's hat?

345
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,528
Dude, stop talking crazy,
and make us some tea!
