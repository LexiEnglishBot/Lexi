1
00:00:02,166 --> 00:00:03,933
- Morning.
- Hi.

2
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:05,920
How was your date?

3
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:08,494
- Pretty good.
- Oh, good.

4
00:00:10,863 --> 00:00:12,974
My God. Sorry about that.

5
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:16,211
Okay, really good.

6
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,238
I gotta go. I'm late.

7
00:00:18,483 --> 00:00:20,500
You're going to leave
her with me?

8
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:22,760
Don't worry,
she's a terrific girl.

9
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:24,391
Can you do me a favor?

10
00:00:24,676 --> 00:00:29,124
Could you mention I'm not looking
for a relationship? That'd be great.

11
00:00:29,407 --> 00:00:31,175
What, are you kidding?

12
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,829
Just casually slip it in, you know.
Lay the groundwork.

13
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:38,374
Tell her I'm a loner.
No, an outlaw.

14
00:00:38,627 --> 00:00:41,687
She doesn't want to get mixed up
with the likes of me.

15
00:00:41,932 --> 00:00:43,248
That's a lot to remember.

16
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:45,584
Can't I tell her that you're a pig?

17
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:48,568
I'm gonna call her later myself.

18
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,029
Honest.

19
00:00:50,352 --> 00:00:53,306
Chandler used to do it.
He'd make her pancakes.

20
00:00:53,588 --> 00:00:56,221
He'd make extras
and leave them for me.

21
00:00:56,788 --> 00:01:00,014
I'm not telling her anything.
It's not my responsibility.

22
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:01,477
Fine.

23
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:05,204
Now, where did we land
on those pancakes?

24
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,278
- Hi.
- Hi.

25
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:13,686
Sorry, but I couldn't get
that lock to work.

26
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,965
Yeah, Joey kind of disabled it
when I moved in.

27
00:01:17,663 --> 00:01:20,332
- You must be Rachel. I'm Erin.
- Hi.

28
00:01:21,108 --> 00:01:25,556
I don't mean this to sound like high
school, but did he talk about me?

29
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,873
Would you like some pancakes?

30
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,778
The One With Ross's Library Book

31
00:02:11,243 --> 00:02:15,027
- Come on. Why are we here?
- Okay, okay, take a guess.

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,988
The hot chicks?

33
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:22,685
Okay, okay, I was typing names
into the library computer earlier...

34
00:02:23,002 --> 00:02:24,141
...you know, for fun.

35
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:27,550
And I typed mine in,
and guess what came up.

36
00:02:27,873 --> 00:02:29,676
My doctoral dissertation.

37
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,993
It's right down here in the biggest
library in the university.

38
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:35,805
Wow, that's actually pretty cool.

39
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:41,507
There's also a book here
by a woman named Wendy Bagina.

40
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:46,166
What is that?

41
00:02:47,217 --> 00:02:50,895
Sounds like two people are really
enjoying the Dewey Decimal System.

42
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:58,030
We're so sorry.

43
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,079
You didn't bring me here to do that,
did you?

44
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:12,431
She sent the chicken back again?

45
00:03:12,754 --> 00:03:16,823
She said it's too dry and wants
to explain to you how she wants it.

46
00:03:17,103 --> 00:03:19,356
I'd like to meet this chicken expert.

47
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:21,375
Send the colonel in.

48
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:30,139
Oh, my God!

49
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:33,722
Lucky bastard.

50
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:37,312
- Janice.
- How are you...

51
00:03:37,526 --> 00:03:42,638
...Ms. Hotshot-Chef-at-the-Big-Fancy-
Restaurant-With-the-Best-Chicken-Ever?

52
00:03:45,563 --> 00:03:47,022
I'm fine.

53
00:03:47,302 --> 00:03:50,706
Oh, what is that on your finger?
I'm blind.

54
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:57,009
Somebody's been doing a little
cooking outside the restaurant.

55
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:02,495
So who's the lucky guy?

56
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:09,983
Funny story.

57
00:04:16,527 --> 00:04:17,463
Hey, what's up?

58
00:04:19,832 --> 00:04:22,086
Hey, who's your friend?

59
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,263
- Hey, Joey.
- Erin.

60
00:04:27,383 --> 00:04:28,628
You're still here.

61
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:34,233
We ended up spending the day together
and had such a great time.

62
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,221
Why wouldn't you? Erin is great.

63
00:04:37,506 --> 00:04:39,795
And then there's you guys.

64
00:04:40,082 --> 00:04:43,380
Well, listen, I better get going.

65
00:04:43,665 --> 00:04:44,980
Today was great. Thanks.

66
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:48,949
And, Joey, last night was fun.

67
00:04:49,232 --> 00:04:51,520
Yeah. I'll call you.

68
00:04:51,842 --> 00:04:53,680
- I'll call you too.
- Or I'll call you.

69
00:04:53,963 --> 00:04:55,493
- And call me.
- Okay.

70
00:04:56,746 --> 00:04:59,416
Look at that,
we're all gonna call each other.

71
00:04:59,635 --> 00:05:01,023
Good to see you again.

72
00:05:01,304 --> 00:05:03,036
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

73
00:05:04,853 --> 00:05:07,807
The system kind of broke down, huh?

74
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:12,331
Joey, I'm sorry. I just couldn't
tell her all those things.

75
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:14,343
And we got to talking, and I...

76
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:16,609
We want you to marry her.

77
00:05:17,587 --> 00:05:18,595
What?

78
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:21,306
She is so amazing. You have no idea.

79
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:23,356
Who do you think brought her here?

80
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,955
Cupid.

81
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:29,691
She's so cool.
She speaks four languages.

82
00:05:29,868 --> 00:05:32,679
Man, do you know what guys want.

83
00:05:36,026 --> 00:05:39,324
Come on, she's so perfect for you.
She's sweet.

84
00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:42,835
She likes baseball.
She had two beers at lunch.

85
00:05:43,124 --> 00:05:44,618
My beers?!

86
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,128
Look, she's a very nice girl.

87
00:05:48,377 --> 00:05:51,367
We had a very good time,
but I don't see it going anywhere.

88
00:05:51,648 --> 00:05:53,001
You always say that.

89
00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:56,095
Maybe if you gave her a chance,
it would go somewhere.

90
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,120
I'm sorry, you guys.
I just don't think so.

91
00:05:59,824 --> 00:06:01,591
- Whatever.
- Fine.

92
00:06:01,842 --> 00:06:04,653
Hey, don't start judging me.

93
00:06:04,938 --> 00:06:06,741
You're in love with your assistant.

94
00:06:07,443 --> 00:06:10,705
You're having an affair with the guy
who keeps pigeons on the roof.

95
00:06:11,758 --> 00:06:12,932
Phoebe!

96
00:06:13,254 --> 00:06:15,199
Secret affair.

97
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:19,272
What did I say?

98
00:06:25,465 --> 00:06:27,339
Hey, cutie-cutie.

99
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:32,840
So I ran into someone you know
today at work.

100
00:06:33,085 --> 00:06:35,232
Oh, yeah? Who was it?

101
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,701
Oh, my God.

102
00:06:41,957 --> 00:06:44,245
I am so sorry, sweetie.

103
00:06:44,461 --> 00:06:46,371
Are you okay?

104
00:06:48,254 --> 00:06:50,056
You didn't tell her we're engaged?

105
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:52,774
- She saw the ring.
- Did she freak out?

106
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:56,212
She was shocked,
but then again, so were most people.

107
00:06:58,274 --> 00:07:00,847
She actually has a boyfriend herself.

108
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:02,546
Name's Clark.

109
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,708
She also invited herself
to our wedding.

110
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:07,383
Clark too.

111
00:07:09,617 --> 00:07:10,862
You said no, right?

112
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,992
You said no, right?

113
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,295
She cornered me. She asked me
if the wedding was in town.

114
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:22,485
- What was I supposed to do?
- Lie.

115
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:26,204
How hard is that?
"Your check's in the mail."

116
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:28,814
"Oh, your baby's so cute."

117
00:07:29,725 --> 00:07:33,023
"I can't wait to read your book, Ross."

118
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,999
So she comes to the wedding.
Maybe it won't be so bad.

119
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:42,069
Think she'll sit quietly?
Think she'll want to make a toast?

120
00:07:42,356 --> 00:07:46,069
You don't think she'll want
to sing "Part-Time Lover"?

121
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:50,521
Oh, my God. She's not gonna like
the chicken either, is she?

122
00:07:53,732 --> 00:07:55,570
You know what? Lt'll be okay.

123
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:58,357
She's probably not gonna even
want to come.

124
00:07:58,637 --> 00:08:02,006
- Really?
- No, that was a lie.

125
00:08:02,534 --> 00:08:04,551
See how easy that was?

126
00:08:05,457 --> 00:08:08,303
So you would have just lied?

127
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:09,938
Yes.

128
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:14,147
- It would have really been that easy?
- Yes.

129
00:08:14,398 --> 00:08:17,423
Do it Saturday. We're having
dinner with her and Clark.

130
00:08:31,655 --> 00:08:32,864
Hi.

131
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:34,923
What's wrong?

132
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:37,980
People are doing it
in front of my book.

133
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:40,316
I'm sorry?

134
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,288
My doctoral dissertation is in the
library at school. I went to see it.

135
00:08:45,676 --> 00:08:50,753
And there were students making babies
right in the paleontology section.

136
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,400
Oh, my God.
Did you get to see anything good?

137
00:08:55,313 --> 00:08:57,638
- That's not the point.
- I know that's not the point.

138
00:08:57,853 --> 00:09:00,522
I'm trying to make it the point.

139
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,159
At your school...

140
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:07,488
...was there a place on campus
where students went to fool around?

141
00:09:07,873 --> 00:09:08,941
Yeah, there was.

142
00:09:09,265 --> 00:09:13,678
In the corner of the library where all
the books were that nobody ever read.

143
00:09:13,962 --> 00:09:15,978
Yes, there was.

144
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:20,429
Great, because people kept showing up.
I think it's like a thing.

145
00:09:20,885 --> 00:09:22,344
Hold on a second.

146
00:09:22,694 --> 00:09:25,576
Fifth floor, against that back wall?

147
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:29,612
Oh, for crying out loud!

148
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:35,355
- So we should go catch our movie.
- What's the rush?

149
00:09:35,636 --> 00:09:38,234
I like to see the previews.

150
00:09:39,186 --> 00:09:40,739
The candy.

151
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,477
- Oh, hey.
- Well, look who's here.

152
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:47,220
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Erin.

153
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:48,676
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi.

154
00:09:48,962 --> 00:09:51,536
We were about to take off
and see a movie.

155
00:09:52,232 --> 00:09:55,352
- Oh, no!
- What's wrong?

156
00:09:55,642 --> 00:09:59,805
Phoebe, we forgot that party
we have to go to.

157
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:01,899
Oh, no.

158
00:10:02,948 --> 00:10:03,920
What party?

159
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,038
- A birthday party.
- A birthday party.

160
00:10:07,193 --> 00:10:08,545
Whose birthday party?

161
00:10:08,828 --> 00:10:11,117
- Alison's birthday party.
- Alison's birthday party.

162
00:10:13,594 --> 00:10:14,839
And how old is Alison?

163
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:16,478
- Thirty-two.
- Thirty-two.

164
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:22,491
- I feel so terrible ditching you like this.
- No, that's okay.

165
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:26,115
Wait a minute.
Why don't you guys do something?

166
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:28,760
Look how that worked out.

167
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:36,415
- You want to catch a movie?
- Yeah, sure. That will be fun.

168
00:10:36,627 --> 00:10:38,809
Guess I'll talk to you guys
after Alison's party.

169
00:10:39,028 --> 00:10:42,741
- That, actually, might go late.
- I'll wait up.

170
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:52,903
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here.

171
00:10:53,188 --> 00:10:57,909
Do you know the paleontology section,
fifth floor, stack 437?

172
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:01,115
Well, yes.
Just give me five minutes.

173
00:11:01,364 --> 00:11:04,353
I just have to find someone
to cover my shift.

174
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:09,812
No, no, no.

175
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,076
Can I speak to someone in charge?

176
00:11:16,011 --> 00:11:16,983
How can I help?

177
00:11:17,194 --> 00:11:20,528
Hi, I was wondering, is it possible
to increase security...

178
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:22,686
...in the paleontology section?

179
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:24,594
I wrote a book that's up there.

180
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,206
And instead of reading it,
people are...

181
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,553
Well, they're rolling around
in front of it.

182
00:11:31,737 --> 00:11:34,998
We are aware of the problem
you're referring to.

183
00:11:39,843 --> 00:11:43,520
As far as increasing security,
I'm afraid the library's understaffed.

184
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:46,170
I can't help you.

185
00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:47,978
Well, fine.

186
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:51,109
If I'm the only person
with any appreciation...

187
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:55,108
...of the sanctity of the written word,
then I'll go defend it myself.

188
00:11:55,778 --> 00:11:57,722
Don't you follow me.

189
00:12:02,632 --> 00:12:05,586
- How did it go with Erin?
- Unbelievable.

190
00:12:05,902 --> 00:12:07,811
We had the best time.

191
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:12,640
- So you're not mad anymore?
- No, no. You guys were totally right.

192
00:12:12,896 --> 00:12:15,078
This was much better than
the first date.

193
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:17,833
That was awkward.
We were both nervous.

194
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:21,139
- Didn't you sleep together?
- Yeah, that calms me down.

195
00:12:23,298 --> 00:12:25,136
And we have so much in common.

196
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:30,462
She loves sandwiches, sports.
Although she is a Met fan.

197
00:12:30,987 --> 00:12:33,656
Not an issue now,
but if we had kids...

198
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:37,800
Oh, my God! Listen to you talking
about having kids.

199
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:41,311
Oh, my Joey.

200
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:43,852
Please don't get married before I do.

201
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,486
I just cannot believe
that Clark stood me up.

202
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,194
He may still show up.

203
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,691
What are you, stupid?

204
00:13:02,022 --> 00:13:05,462
- It's been three hours.
- Is that all?

205
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:10,325
I just feel like such a fool.
I thought this guy was my soul mate.

206
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,906
I thought I was your soul mate.

207
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:16,869
What am I doing?

208
00:13:17,086 --> 00:13:20,146
You know, let's just...
Oh, let's forget about Clark.

209
00:13:20,357 --> 00:13:23,903
Let's go on to happier things.

210
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:26,687
Why don't you tell me
about your lovely wedding.

211
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:31,654
There was something that we wanted
to tell you about the wedding.

212
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,167
It's going to be a small ceremony.

213
00:13:35,491 --> 00:13:37,020
Tiny.

214
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:40,982
We're not even sure
why we're having it.

215
00:13:41,753 --> 00:13:44,873
It's actually going to be just family.

216
00:13:46,068 --> 00:13:48,950
Oh, wait.

217
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:53,441
You two think of me as family?

218
00:13:57,235 --> 00:14:00,426
I have to ask you something now,
and be honest.

219
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:05,270
Do you want me to sing
"Careless Whisper" or "Lady in Red"?

220
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,900
How can you say that?
The Mets have no closer.

221
00:14:11,187 --> 00:14:14,377
- What about Benitez?
- What about game one of the series?

222
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,098
- What about shut up?
- You shut up.

223
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:20,023
I love arguing with her.

224
00:14:20,372 --> 00:14:22,104
- Be right back.
- Okay.

225
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:26,980
So how's the second-greatest
love affair of the century?

226
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:28,685
Second? Who's the first?

227
00:14:28,862 --> 00:14:32,195
Me and this muffin.
My God, it's delicious.

228
00:14:32,863 --> 00:14:34,665
How's it going with Joey?

229
00:14:34,846 --> 00:14:36,790
Oh, okay.

230
00:14:37,038 --> 00:14:38,425
Okay?

231
00:14:38,638 --> 00:14:42,600
Tell me that you like him, please.
I mean, tell me that you like him.

232
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:47,160
He's a really great guy, and I know
you really want this to work out...

233
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:50,358
...but I just don't see this
having a future.

234
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:55,783
But you said that you liked him.
What happened?

235
00:14:56,068 --> 00:14:58,808
Did you just change your mind?

236
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,972
- Kind of.
- Then change it back!

237
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:06,843
I'm sorry.
It's just, there's no real spark.

238
00:15:07,098 --> 00:15:08,901
Didn't you sleep together?

239
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:10,498
Yeah.

240
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,445
Tramp.

241
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:15,828
Does Joey have any idea?

242
00:15:16,109 --> 00:15:18,434
I don't think he does.
You know what?

243
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,387
Maybe you could tell him
I'm not interested...

244
00:15:21,675 --> 00:15:23,549
...in a serious relationship.

245
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,198
You mean, like,
that you're kind of a loner?

246
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,873
Yeah, that'd be great.

247
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,937
- And maybe that you're a real stronzo.
- I'm sorry?

248
00:15:33,192 --> 00:15:36,833
I guess Italian isn't one
of the four languages you speak.

249
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,877
- Hey. Want to go?
- Yeah, let's go.

250
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:45,193
- Okay. See you guys later.
- Bye, guys.

251
00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:48,246
Hey, thank you so much.

252
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,012
Wow.

253
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:56,042
I guess it wasn't cupid
that brought her here.

254
00:15:56,328 --> 00:15:59,804
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.

255
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,398
Yes, yes? How can I help you?

256
00:16:09,723 --> 00:16:11,490
We were just looking around.

257
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:13,958
Oh, you're fellow scholars.

258
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:16,712
What exactly were you looking for?

259
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:21,053
Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's
musings...

260
00:16:21,308 --> 00:16:23,775
...on the Smilodon californicus?

261
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,908
Get out of here!

262
00:16:37,626 --> 00:16:39,085
Meeting someone?

263
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,034
Or are you just here to brush up...

264
00:16:42,358 --> 00:16:45,204
...on Merriam's views on evolution?

265
00:16:45,593 --> 00:16:50,112
Actually, I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

266
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:58,039
I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

267
00:16:58,327 --> 00:17:01,446
I'm sorry. Who are you?

268
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,848
I'm a professor here. Ross Geller.

269
00:17:04,206 --> 00:17:07,753
Ross Geller? Why do I know that name?
It's a...

270
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:09,179
Wait.

271
00:17:13,252 --> 00:17:14,497
Did you write this?

272
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,868
Yes.

273
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:23,996
You're the person
who checked out my book?

274
00:17:25,186 --> 00:17:29,705
You know, you look nothing
like I would have thought.

275
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,829
You're so young.

276
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:36,797
Well, I skipped fourth grade.

277
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:48,665
I am very, very sorry.

278
00:17:57,716 --> 00:18:01,678
- So how was your date?
- Great. We walked around the Village.

279
00:18:01,961 --> 00:18:04,534
We went to this ice-cream place.
Split a milk shake.

280
00:18:04,814 --> 00:18:06,438
Seventy-thirty, but still.

281
00:18:07,597 --> 00:18:11,275
I'm thinking of taking her upstate
to one of those bed and breakfasts.

282
00:18:11,598 --> 00:18:13,780
Really? She said she wants to go?

283
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:18,266
No, it's a surprise. It's gonna be
tricky because she's busy at work.

284
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:20,703
- She said that?
- Yes.

285
00:18:20,922 --> 00:18:24,041
Joey, don't you think maybe
it's kind of quick...

286
00:18:24,262 --> 00:18:27,489
...for you to be going away together
on a trip?

287
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:32,155
Not for me. No, I want to spend
as much time with her as I can.

288
00:18:33,865 --> 00:18:37,448
Okay, honey.
Joey, we need to talk, okay?

289
00:18:40,301 --> 00:18:42,246
I got the feeling from her...

290
00:18:42,562 --> 00:18:46,975
...that she's not looking
for a serious relationship.

291
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:50,596
- Where are you getting this?
- She told me.

292
00:18:52,652 --> 00:18:54,870
She said she's kind of a loner.

293
00:19:03,437 --> 00:19:05,690
- Joey...
- Hey, Rach, it's cool, you know.

294
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:08,612
I'm a loner too, right?

295
00:19:09,805 --> 00:19:13,103
Hey, Joey. You know what?
You are way too good for her.

296
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:18,253
I promise, next time I will tell them
you're not looking for a relationship.

297
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:24,092
No, don't do that. Just...

298
00:19:25,982 --> 00:19:29,078
- Next time, make sure she likes me.
- Well, that too.

299
00:19:34,263 --> 00:19:35,508
Joey?

300
00:19:38,856 --> 00:19:40,932
- Do you want some pancakes?
- Finally.

301
00:19:45,014 --> 00:19:46,568
What are we gonna do?

302
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:48,798
I say we go with "Careless Whisper."

303
00:19:52,911 --> 00:19:53,979
Chandler?

304
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:56,838
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?

305
00:20:01,748 --> 00:20:03,693
Janice, what are you doing here?

306
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,679
I thought I was gonna go back
to my apartment...

307
00:20:07,037 --> 00:20:12,008
...but I just felt like I really
couldn't be alone tonight.

308
00:20:16,744 --> 00:20:21,465
I was just wondering if I could maybe
stay here with you.

309
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:25,052
Just, I really feel like I need
to be with family.

310
00:20:27,147 --> 00:20:30,207
Our kids are gonna call her
Aunt Janice, aren't they?

311
00:20:30,835 --> 00:20:35,698
Please. Because otherwise,
I really don't know what I might do.

312
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:40,011
Aren't you just a teensy bit curious?

313
00:20:41,028 --> 00:20:43,698
- Do you have any tissues?
- Yeah, in the bathroom.

314
00:20:47,604 --> 00:20:49,300
We'll just let her stay.

315
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:53,751
No. If we let her stay,
she will stay forever.

316
00:20:55,014 --> 00:20:58,240
- Kind of like your Barcalounger.
- Is that what you're thinking about?

317
00:20:58,494 --> 00:21:00,226
I never stop thinking about it.

318
00:21:01,381 --> 00:21:04,964
- What are we going to do?
- Nothing. We'll just have to let her stay.

319
00:21:05,173 --> 00:21:07,605
We can't. We gotta fight!

320
00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:09,686
Fight!

321
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,208
Chandler, she has beaten me.

322
00:21:13,385 --> 00:21:15,117
I'm tired, Chandler.

323
00:21:15,332 --> 00:21:17,693
So very tired!

324
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,441
Hey, you guys?

325
00:21:20,725 --> 00:21:23,715
Do either one of you want to get
in there before I take my bath?

326
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:27,956
Janice, I'm sorry...

327
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:31,537
...but you can't stay here tonight.

328
00:21:32,242 --> 00:21:33,250
Why not?

329
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:35,023
Honestly?

330
00:21:35,373 --> 00:21:38,493
Our apartment is a hotbed...

331
00:21:38,817 --> 00:21:41,320
...for electromagnetic activity.

332
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,118
Monica and I have been immunized,
but sadly...

333
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,357
...you have not.

334
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:57,150
I'm gonna need a comforter.

335
00:21:57,466 --> 00:22:00,941
Do you have a hypoallergenic one?
Because otherwise I get very nasal.

336
00:22:04,598 --> 00:22:08,003
Do you have a cat?
Because it's already happening.

337
00:22:08,564 --> 00:22:10,058
Do you hear that? Listen.

338
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:16,698
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
You have to go.

339
00:22:16,984 --> 00:22:17,920
Why?

340
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,210
Because Chandler still has
feelings for you.

341
00:22:26,864 --> 00:22:27,967
He does?

342
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,055
Say again?

343
00:22:30,831 --> 00:22:33,084
That's right. That's right.

344
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:36,431
And that is why you can't
stay here tonight.

345
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,841
And probably why you shouldn't come
to the wedding.

346
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:43,901
Feelings. Such strong feelings.

347
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:50,131
I mean, I realize that his feelings
may never completely go away...

348
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:52,400
...but you can.

349
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,256
Oh, my God.

350
00:22:56,542 --> 00:23:00,125
I understand. I am so sorry.

351
00:23:00,404 --> 00:23:01,756
I'll go.

352
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:08,612
Goodbye, Monica.

353
00:23:08,928 --> 00:23:12,961
I wish you a lifetime
of happiness with him.

354
00:23:13,242 --> 00:23:14,250
Chandler.

355
00:23:16,303 --> 00:23:18,521
You call me when this goes
in the pooper.

356
00:23:30,707 --> 00:23:32,545
I got this section covered.

357
00:23:32,865 --> 00:23:35,782
Yeah, in fact, I've got this baby
to shine in people's eye...

358
00:23:35,961 --> 00:23:37,729
Okay, see you later.

359
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:50,463
I just wanted
to show Monica your book.
