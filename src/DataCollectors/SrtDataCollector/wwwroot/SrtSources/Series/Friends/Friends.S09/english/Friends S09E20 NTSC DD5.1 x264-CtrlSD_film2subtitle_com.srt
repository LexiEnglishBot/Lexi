1
00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:04,699
Hey, you guys?
What are you doing tomorrow night?

2
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:08,102
Oh, well, let me see.
l believe l'm....

3
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:10,435
Yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.

4
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,843
Well, my agent hooked me up
with six tickets to a great play.

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,642
l could fall asleep at a play.

6
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,843
-What is it?
-lt's a one-woman play called:

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,081
<i>Why Don't You Like Me?</i>
<i>A Bitter Woman's Journey Through Life.</i>

8
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:27,386
-That sounds interesting.
-That does sound interesting.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,156
To listen to a woman complain for
two hours. l don't think it gets bet--

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,033
l know! l know. We can drive.
We can vote. We can work.

11
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,694
What more do these broads want?

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,031
Well, you guys will have a great time.
l promise.

13
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,938
What? How come you don't have to go?

14
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,703
l wish l could, but l found out...

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,372
...that l have to be at work really early
the next day, so l can't go.

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,144
But take the extra ticket
and invite whoever you want.

17
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,287
Let's see. Who do l hate?

18
00:00:58,491 --> 00:00:59,890
Oh, sorry.

19
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,659
-Oops, sorry.
-Okay.

20
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,420
-Okay.
-Okay. Up we go.

21
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,791
-Oh, gosh, okay!
-All right.

22
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,740
Can l ask you a question?

23
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:21,978
Do you think it's possible
for two friends to fool around...

24
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:25,413
...and not have it be a big deal?

25
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,311
No, l don't think that ever works. Why?

26
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,791
-No reason.
-No, no. Rachel?

27
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,756
-Who do you want to fool around with?
-Nobody! Forget it.

28
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,327
Joey?

29
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,694
Maybe.

30
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,258
-You can't.
-Why?

31
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,960
Because!

32
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,837
Okay, seriously, did not understand
a word you just said.

33
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,875
-ln the hall.
-Okay.

34
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,450
-You wanna fool around with Joey?
-Yeah.

35
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,146
Ever since l had that dream about him,
l can't get it out of my head.

36
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,951
l mean, what's the big deal?
People do it all the time.

37
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,788
Who do you know that are friends
that just fool around?

38
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:13,194
Okay. Off the top of my head....
Don and Janet.

39
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,096
-Who are they?
-l know them from work.

40
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,001
-Both of them?
-No, just one of them.

41
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,969
Which one?

42
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:24,070
l don't know.
What were the names l just said?

43
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:27,008
No, Rachel, things could get
incredibly complicated.

44
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,638
All right. You're right. l won't do anything
with Joey. l just thought it--

45
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:35,686
Okay, so that's two cups of tarragon,
one pound of baking soda and a red onion?

46
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,852
What the hell are you cooking?

47
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,545
You guys won't believe
what l have to do for work today.

48
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:39,275
Yes, but, Ross, you chose a career
of talking about dinosaurs.

49
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,845
There are these two professors
who are joining my department...

50
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:48,015
...and l have to meet them here
and show them around campus.

51
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,354
What's so bad about that?

52
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,225
l just know they'll be
a couple of old windbags...

53
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,959
...wearing tweed jackets
with suede elbow patches.

54
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,028
Ross?

55
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,900
What? These aren't suede.

56
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,536
Excuse me. l'm looking for someone.

57
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,740
You don't, by any chance,
know a Ross Geller?

58
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,214
No.

59
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,819
Hi. Hi, l'm Ross Geller.

60
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,722
Oh, hi. l'm Professor Wheeler.

61
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,194
Oh, that's-- That's--
That's nice.

62
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,197
lt's good to meet you.

63
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,235
Thank you so much for taking the time
to show me around.

64
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,235
No, it's no big deal.

65
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:37,172
lf l weren't doing this, l'd just,
you know, be at the gym working out.

66
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,073
ls he gonna introduce us?

67
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:43,579
l think we're just blurry shapes
to him now.

68
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,747
By the way,
l really enjoyed your paper...

69
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:51,379
...on the connection between geographic
isolation and rapid mutagenesis.

70
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,520
l wrote that in one night.

71
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,754
Twenty bucks says they're married
within the month.

72
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,064
Well, we should probably get going.

73
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,028
You know, we've got a lot
of ground to cover.

74
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,900
lsn't another professor
supposed to come with us?

75
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,767
l don't think so.

76
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,772
l'm pretty sure.
A Professor Spafford from Cornell?

77
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:17,040
Well, he's obviously late,
and the rule in my class is:

78
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:21,152
lf you can't come on time,
then don't come at all.

79
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,482
An option that many of my students use.

80
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,450
-Shall we?
-We shouldn't wait for him?

81
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,892
You know what, he's a big boy.
l'm sure he'll find us, okay?

82
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,464
-Professor Geller?
-Oh, damn it!

83
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,808
<i>Hi, Joey, it's Jan Rogers.</i>
<i>Can't wait for your party tonight.</i>

84
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,609
<i>Listen, I forgot your address.</i>
<i>Can you give me a call? Thanks. Bye.</i>

85
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,249
What's happening?

86
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,690
lt's a real shame you can't make it
to that one-woman show tonight.

87
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,920
l'd love to, but l gotta get up
so early the next day.

88
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,794
-You know me, work comes first.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

89
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:12,837
<i>Hi, Joey, it's Jan Rogers.</i>
<i>Can't wait for your party tonight.</i>

90
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,938
Stupid Jan Rogers!

91
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,912
You are having a party tonight?

92
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,671
-No.
-Joey!

93
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,475
Yeah.

94
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,812
l'm kind of having a thing
for the <i>Days of Our Lives</i> people.

95
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,351
And you weren't gonna tell us?

96
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,955
How did you think you were
gonna get away with that?

97
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,955
l do it every year.

98
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,619
You do that every year?!

99
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,923
l didn't have to tell you that!

100
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,994
God, l'm stupider than Jan Rogers!

101
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:46,199
That's why you got us tickets
to that play, to get rid of us!

102
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:47,464
Yeah.

103
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,076
Last year is that why you sent us
to that Medieval Times restaurant?

104
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,472
Yeah.

105
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,941
And the year before that, you set up that
nighttime tour of that button factory?

106
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:01,245
l can't believe you guys went
for that one.

107
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,685
Why wouldn't you invite us
to your parties?

108
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,159
You're fine, okay? But everyone else acts
like an idiot around famous people.

109
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:11,262
Well, then, so just invite me.

110
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:15,029
Please, l was trying to be nice.
You're the worst one.

111
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:19,194
Joey, come on! Please, please?
Let me come. l will behave. l promise.

112
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,864
-l will behave. Please, please, please.
-Okay, fine. You can come.

113
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:26,671
But don't tell anybody else.
lt's up on the roof at <i>8</i>.

114
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,437
A soap-opera roof party?!

115
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:32,243
l'm going to a soap-opera roof party!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

116
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,014
And it's out of my system.

117
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:48,225
And then my wife and l went
on a cruise to the Galápagos.

118
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:52,633
There was a seafood buffet
you wouldn't believe.

119
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:57,908
There were clams and mussels
and oysters...

120
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,375
...and cracked crab...

121
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,707
...and snow crab...

122
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,373
...and king crab.

123
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,748
lt's a pity l'm allergic to shellfish.

124
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:13,191
So where did you get
your undergraduate degree?

125
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:17,090
-And that's not all l'm allergic to.
-Oh, it's not over.

126
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:21,393
l'm also allergic to peanuts
and cashews...

127
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,797
...and almonds and filberts--

128
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,562
So basically all nuts!

129
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,033
lnterestingly, no.

130
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:32,676
You're kind of playing it fast and loose
with the word ''interesting.''

131
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,008
lf you'll excuse me,
l'm going to use the restroom.

132
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,208
When l come back,
remind me to tell you...

133
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:44,152
...about the different types
of animal dander l'm allergic to.

134
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,322
Oh, my God!

135
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,689
l've lost the will to live.

136
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,888
-Let's ditch him.
-What?

137
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,762
While he's still in the bathroom.
l am begging you.

138
00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:00,736
Okay. Okay, fine,
but l just have one question for you.

139
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,967
When we exit, should we walk or run...

140
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,440
...or prance or stroll--?

141
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:10,048
Stop it! Stop it! He talks slow,
but he might pee fast. Okay, let's move!

142
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:23,859
-We actually managed to salvage the day.
-Yeah, we did.

143
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,430
Thanks for spending
so much time with me.

144
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,898
l'm so lucky it worked out
you don't have class on Tuesday.

145
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,297
Right.

146
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,406
Oh, hey, you guys, this is Charlie.

147
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,444
Charlie, this is Phoebe
and my sister, Monica.

148
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,777
-Hi.
-Charlie will be joining my department.

149
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,146
-You're a paleontologist too?
-Yeah.

150
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,478
Oh, okay. Now, what do you think...

151
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:53,989
...of Renyard's new theory of species
variegation in segmented arthropods?

152
00:09:55,861 --> 00:10:00,628
Well, l think he's a little out there,
but he does have some interesting ideas.

153
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,269
Oh, l'm sorry. l have to take this.
Excuse me.

154
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,131
Renyard's theory of species variegation?

155
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:11,402
l saw the article on your coffee table.
l memorized the title to freak you out.

156
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,275
So did you two have fun?

157
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,940
Oh, my God. She's great.

158
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:23,418
We have so much in common,
and she's just cool, you know? And funny.

159
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,218
And l don't know if you've noticed,
but she's a hottie!

160
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:28,958
Hi!

161
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:38,567
Hi, you guys. Listen, you know what,
l'm not feeling really well...

162
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:42,174
...and l don't think l'm gonna get
to go to the play.

163
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:43,672
Really? What's wrong?

164
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,038
l don't know.
l think it's kind of serious.

165
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:49,670
You know, l was watching this thing
on TV this morning...

166
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:54,081
...about Newcastle disease,
and l think l might have it.

167
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,944
Newcastle disease is
a secretion-borne virus...

168
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,886
...that only affects chickens
and other poultry.

169
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,824
Okay, who's this?

170
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,696
l'm sorry. Rachel, this is Charlie Wheeler.
She's a colleague.

171
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,767
Hi. Well, l would shake your hand...

172
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:13,234
...but l'm sure you don't want
to get my chicken disease.

173
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,970
-Rachel, can l see you for a second?
-Sure.

174
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,442
You're not sick.

175
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,580
What? Yes, l am!

176
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,185
Okay, then why are you all dressed up?

177
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:34,224
When you're sick, you do whatever
you can to make yourself feel better.

178
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:39,161
You just want to stay home
so you can make a move on Joey.

179
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:42,061
No, l heard you before.
That is so not what this is.

180
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,202
Okay, then what is this?

181
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,603
Okay.

182
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,469
Joey is having a secret
<i>Days of Our Lives</i> party up on the roof.

183
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,168
And he sent you guys to the play
to get rid of you.

184
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,341
What?!

185
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,410
What? What's going on?

186
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:01,212
Joey is having a secret
<i>Days of Our Lives</i> party up on the roof!

187
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:05,824
He didn't want you to know about it,
but l came over here to tell you.

188
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:09,917
-You came to say you were sick.
-All right, professor or detective?

189
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,659
Wait, Joey's having a party,
and he wasn't gonna invite us?

190
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:18,429
He does it every year.
That's why he's sending you to the play.

191
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:22,768
That's why he sent us to that medieval
restaurant and to that button factory.

192
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,240
And that horrible museum tour?

193
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,375
No, l arranged that.

194
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,147
Hey, you guys, l'm turning in.
Have fun.

195
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,251
We know about your party, Joey.

196
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,952
-What party?
-The game's over. Take off your robe.

197
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,893
Okay, l mean....

198
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,300
Close it up! Close it up!

199
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,136
Nice to meet you.

200
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,550
Hey, you made it! All right!

201
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,913
Glad you could make it.
Thanks for coming.

202
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,256
-Oh, my God. Kyle Lowder!
-Hi.

203
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,653
l love you!

204
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:17,489
Hey. That's why l didn't invite you.
You have to calm down, all right?

205
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,664
Just go get yourself a drink
or something.

206
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,733
Oh, yeah, that's what you want.
My inhibitions lowered.

207
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,567
Oh, my God, can you believe
we're surrounded by all this?

208
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,263
l can barely control myself.

209
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,068
Monica, you might want to remember
that you're married.

210
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,473
Where is Chandler anyway?

211
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,170
Oh, my God! Chandler!

212
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,585
Where the hell is everybody?

213
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,421
<i>Why Don't You Like Me?</i>

214
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,631
Chapter 1 : My First Period.

215
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,299
Hey, Joey said no autographs.

216
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,602
But if she's getting one,
l want one too!

217
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:09,839
''To Monica.'' And none of this
''best wishes'' crap. l want ''love.''

218
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:15,052
Okay, actually, Mon, Matthew was
giving me his phone number.

219
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,054
Oh, man! lf l had known
l was coming to this party...

220
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,122
...l never would've gotten married!

221
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,251
-lt was nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

222
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,624
-Call me.
-We will!

223
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:31,928
Look at you with all the guys!
l guess you've forgotten all about Joey.

224
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,868
Yeah, well, l guess l have forgotten
about Joey.

225
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,440
And clearly, you've forgotten
about Chandler.

226
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,537
Please. Chandler's the love of my life.

227
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,805
Oh, leather pants! Have mercy!

228
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,279
So do you get to go
to things like this often?

229
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,514
Come on, this is New York.

230
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,217
l mean, one night you're at a rooftop
party filled with soap stars...

231
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,589
...and the next night, you're....

232
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,461
Who am l kidding, this is so cool.

233
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:05,325
So it's probably gonna be hard
for you to leave Boston, huh?

234
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:09,372
Actually, l'm kind of happy to be leaving.
l just broke up with someone.

235
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,805
Oh, so sad.

236
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,040
Still, it can't be easy
for you to leave Harvard.

237
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:19,275
Especially after working with a Nobel
Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer.

238
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,516
Actually, Albie is the guy
l broke up with.

239
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,782
-You dated Albert Wintermeyer?
-Yeah.

240
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,893
And you called him ''Albie''?

241
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:33,926
l mean, that's like calling
Albert Einstein....

242
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,132
Albie.

243
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,798
Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.

244
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,133
You think?
l mean, you dated the guy...

245
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:45,640
...who improved the accuracy
of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 1 0!

246
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:50,271
Yes, and while that is everything
one looks for in a boyfriend...

247
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,110
...he had a lot of issues.

248
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,149
Oh, like what?

249
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,716
l'm sorry. l don't mean to pry.
lt's just that this must be...

250
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:02,020
...what regular people experience
when they watch <i>Access Hollywood.</i>

251
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,257
Okay, you want the dirt?

252
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,557
Albie was seriously insecure.

253
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,929
He was really intimidated by the guy
l dated before him.

254
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,503
Who's intimidating to a guy
who won the Nobel Prize?

255
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,663
A guy who won two.

256
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,503
Two? What--?

257
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,645
Don't tell me you dated
Benjamin Hobart?

258
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,713
Yeah, for three years.

259
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,280
Oh, my God.

260
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:29,451
Have you ever been in a relationship with
someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?

261
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,515
No.

262
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,452
But there was
my first boyfriend, Billy.

263
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,959
Oh, yeah? No Nobel Prizes for him?

264
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,395
No, but he did just win
the MacArthur ''genius grant.''

265
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,427
What a loser.

266
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,905
Some more wine?

267
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,511
Hey, Ross. How's it going with Charlie?

268
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,545
Oh, great. After l finish my wine...

269
00:16:56,715 --> 00:17:00,651
...l'm gonna blow
my average-sized brains out.

270
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,382
What's the matter?

271
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:07,184
She only dates geniuses
and Nobel Prize winners.

272
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,157
Oh, my God, at the Chinese restaurant
earlier today...

273
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:14,663
...l put chopsticks in my mouth
and pretended to be a woolly mammoth.

274
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,067
l always loved that.

275
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,728
Of course you would!
Your brains are smaller than mine!

276
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,903
l can't compete with the guys
she goes out with.

277
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,602
They're so out of my league.

278
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,240
Oh, my God!

279
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,383
-Worse?
-Oh, much, much worse.

280
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,611
l did my impression of Joan Rivers
as one of the earliest amphibians.

281
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,016
''Can we walk?''

282
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,522
-Oh, you like that?
-No.

283
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,921
What?

284
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:46,428
Come on! l think that's funny!

285
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,726
Woolly mammoth.

286
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,596
lt's good!

287
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,868
l bet you're thinking that now would be
a great time for an intermission, huh?

288
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,704
Oh, yes. God, yes.

289
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,213
Well, you're not gonna get one!

290
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,748
Because in life, there are
no intermissions, people!

291
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:10,818
Now, Chapter 7:
Divorce is a Four-Letter Word!

292
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,149
How could he leave me?!

293
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,557
l don't know. You seem lovely.

294
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:30,770
Ross, this is one of my costars, Dirk.
Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.

295
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,343
-Nice to meet you.
-So, what show are you on?

296
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,913
l'm not an actor.
l'm a professor of paleontology.

297
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,478
That's science.

298
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,782
Hey, well, listen,
l play a scientist on <i>Days.</i>

299
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,822
Yeah, my character just won
a Nobel Prize.

300
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,628
Ross, Dirk was wondering about the woman
you brought and if you guys are together?

301
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,094
Well, no, but....

302
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:59,169
l mean, she only goes out
with really, really smart guys.

303
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,466
Hey, l got a 690 on my SATs.

304
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,768
l'd lead with that.

305
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,844
That's it. Just sign right on the bra.

306
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:12,775
Monica!

307
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,085
Don't worry, Joe.
l won't come next year!

308
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,754
What the--?

309
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,189
What do you got there?

310
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,853
Just some boys gave me
their phone numbers.

311
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:28,295
Oh, really? Let me see.

312
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,501
Damn, that's a lot of guys.

313
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,103
Are you a little slutty?

314
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,971
l think l am.

315
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:41,135
Let me see if l approve
of any of these clowns.

316
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,543
-This guy wears a rug.
-Well....

317
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,149
This guy's Canadian.

318
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,212
Oh, and this guy is in a cult, okay?

319
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:53,290
lt'll cost you $5000 to get to level three,
and l don't feel any different.

320
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,820
Pass. Pa-- Oh, pass. Pass.

321
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:01,193
-Why? What's wrong with these guys?
-Well, nothing major.

322
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,699
lt's just that, you know,
they're not really good enough for you...

323
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,337
...and you deserve the best.

324
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,570
Joey, you're so sweet.

325
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:14,110
lt's true, but it doesn't matter. l already
know who you're going home with.

326
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,008
Who?

327
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,950
Me.

328
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,677
What?

329
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,018
Really?

330
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,520
Yeah, because we live together.
lt's a joke! lt's a joke.

331
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,958
Right! That's funny! l get it!

332
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:34,064
-Got you!
-You're funny, Joey.

333
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,329
Oh, my God.

334
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,138
So how did you enjoy the play?

335
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:50,547
Oh, my God.
Honey, l am so, so, so, so sorry.

336
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:51,740
Well, you should be.

337
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:56,081
You missed the most powerful
three hours in the history of the theater.

338
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,418
-You really liked it?
-Oh, yeah. l mean, at first l hated it.

339
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:03,789
But why wouldn't l? Because as a man,
l've been trained not to listen!

340
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,790
But after Chapter 1 6:

341
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,629
Fat, Single and Ready to Mingle...

342
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,931
...l was uplifted.

343
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,099
-Oh, really?
-Oh, yeah.

344
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,541
l had no idea the amazing journey
you go through as a woman.

345
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:24,712
Tell me--
Tell me about your first period.

346
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,715
No!

347
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,048
Did somebody sign your bra?

348
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:35,216
So l got it when l was 1 3.
Very difficult.

349
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:41,092
Hey, Ross? So listen,
about you and the dinosaur girl?

350
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:44,929
Are you really just gonna let
a couple of Nobel Prizes scare you off?

351
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,435
What is that?
Come on, a piece of paper?

352
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,665
lt's actually a million-dollar prize.

353
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,000
Go, Charlie!

354
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,943
But my point is...

355
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:59,015
...okay, so she dated them,
but she also broke up with them.

356
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:04,746
Maybe she's looking to, you know,
slum it with some average Joe Ph.D.

357
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:10,754
Yeah, maybe, and l do have
my whole career in front of me.

358
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,362
l mean....

359
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:15,466
l could still win a Nobel Prize.

360
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:21,470
Although the last two papers
l've written were widely discredited.

361
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:28,336
You're so much more than just brains.
You are sweet and kind and funny.

362
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,080
And sexy.

363
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:33,308
Okay, well, give her a chance
to see all that.

364
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,652
Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

365
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,346
-Thanks. l'm gonna go find her.
-Good for you.

366
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:43,426
And your paper on punctuated equilibrium
in the Devonian Era was topnotch.

367
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:45,654
Stop going through my stuff!

368
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,968
l just wanted to let you know
l've changed my mind.

369
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,163
l'm gonna do it.
l'm gonna kiss Joey.

370
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,832
No! You can't!
Friends hooking up is a bad idea.

371
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,978
Please! What about you and Chandler?

372
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:04,115
That's different. l was drunk and stupid.

373
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,648
Well, hello?

374
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:11,016
What about all the guys that you got
the phone numbers from?

375
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,749
-Why don't you just kiss one of them.
-l could...

376
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:17,383
...but l don't want to.
l want to kiss Joey.

377
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:22,156
All right. l think it's a big mistake,
but it's your decision.

378
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,395
l'm gonna do it.

379
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,098
-And l can't stop you?
-No.

380
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,205
Well, can l at least have
the phone numbers.

381
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,822
Hey, Rach, have you seen
Charlie anywhere?

382
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,034
l'm smarter than him!

383
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,076
Hey, thank you so much
for these tickets, Chandler.

384
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:11,648
This was a really important experience
for me and l wanted to share it with you.

385
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,580
You're so wonderful.

386
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,979
<i>Why Don't You Like Me?</i>

387
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,893
Chapter 1 : My First Period.

388
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:27,387
l can't believe you guys bought that.
Enjoy your slow death.
