1
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,222
What's going on?

2
00:00:16,428 --> 00:00:18,521
My eye is a little itchy.

3
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:22,392
Mine too. Yeah.

4
00:00:23,268 --> 00:00:26,431
lt's really red.
You should go see my eye doctor.

5
00:00:26,638 --> 00:00:28,936
l'm not gonna see your ex-boyfriend.

6
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:31,803
That's all l hear.
Richard, Richard, Richard.

7
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:35,807
Since we've dated,
l've said his name twice.

8
00:00:36,048 --> 00:00:37,913
Okay. So Richard, Richard.

9
00:00:39,418 --> 00:00:42,285
lt's not Richard.
lt's this new guy. He's good.

10
00:00:42,554 --> 00:00:45,114
l'm sorry. l'm not going
to an eye doctor.

11
00:00:45,324 --> 00:00:48,418
-Oh, God. Here we go.
-What?

12
00:00:48,594 --> 00:00:52,291
Anytime anything comes close
to touching her eye or anyone else's...

13
00:00:52,497 --> 00:00:54,556
...she, like, freaks out. Watch.

14
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:56,432
Ross, come on!

15
00:00:56,668 --> 00:01:00,229
l have a weird thing with my eye.
Can we not talk about it?

16
00:01:03,075 --> 00:01:06,670
Hey, Rach. You know that great song?
''Me, Myself and Eye.''

17
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:08,446
Monica! Come on!

18
00:01:08,647 --> 00:01:11,514
All those in favor
of getting lunch, say, ''eye.''

19
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,183
Ross! Stop it!

20
00:01:13,418 --> 00:01:16,285
How much did l love
<i>The King and Eye</i>?

21
00:01:16,488 --> 00:01:17,477
Chandler!

22
00:01:17,656 --> 00:01:18,645
Me too, me too!

23
00:01:18,857 --> 00:01:21,087
Just stop it! That's enough!

24
00:01:22,661 --> 00:01:25,653
-You okay there, man?
-Yeah. l got too excited.

25
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:31,534
The One with Joey's Big Break

26
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:17,442
l gotta go.
l'm taking Ben to the park.

27
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:20,743
-Give him a kiss for me.
-All right. Bye.

28
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:22,584
Later.

29
00:02:23,121 --> 00:02:25,988
l'm so sorry you got caught
in the middle of that.

30
00:02:26,224 --> 00:02:29,955
l didn't mean to be so out there,
but l am furious with him.

31
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:35,129
Calm down?

32
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:39,566
l'm trying.
Man, that guy can push my buttons!

33
00:02:41,106 --> 00:02:42,403
Why are you so mad?

34
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:45,569
-l don't wanna talk about it.
-lt seems like--

35
00:02:45,777 --> 00:02:48,245
You wanna be on my list too?
Keep talking.

36
00:02:49,915 --> 00:02:52,440
Has anyone seen my list, by the way?

37
00:02:53,418 --> 00:02:54,908
No. What's it look like?

38
00:02:55,153 --> 00:02:58,122
-A piece of paper and it says, ''Ross.''
-l see.

39
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,920
l just got off the phone with Estelle.
Guess what?

40
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,597
l got the lead!

41
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:09,761
You got the lead in a movie?
What's it about?

42
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:13,198
lt's called <i>Shutterspeed.</i>
lt's really cool.

43
00:03:13,472 --> 00:03:17,499
l meet this girl in the subway
and we fall in love in, like, a day.

44
00:03:17,776 --> 00:03:21,644
And then she disappears.
But l find out where she lives.

45
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,145
This old lady answers the door.
l say, ''Where's Betsy?''

46
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,353
And she says, ''Betsy's been dead
for 1 0 years.''

47
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:34,013
Chilling!

48
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:37,855
The best part is, we're filming
in the desert outside of Vegas.

49
00:03:38,163 --> 00:03:40,188
-You know what that means.
-l know.

50
00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:44,198
Road trip! We can rent a car.
l have to be there by Tuesday.

51
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:47,227
Wait! My grandmother's dead.

52
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:55,169
We can talk about that too, Pheebs.

53
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,369
No, her cab.

54
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:59,709
She probably won't be using it.
Drive it to Las Vegas.

55
00:03:59,918 --> 00:04:01,408
All right! Thanks!

56
00:04:01,686 --> 00:04:04,519
What are we gonna do about my job?

57
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:05,914
Not go.

58
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:07,715
Great! Road trip, baby!

59
00:04:09,227 --> 00:04:10,216
ls this okay?

60
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:13,862
Chandler, you don't have to ask
for my permission.

61
00:04:14,032 --> 00:04:15,021
You can go.

62
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:18,935
Rach, we'll be late
for the eye doctor.

63
00:04:19,204 --> 00:04:21,866
All right. Let's get this over with.

64
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:29,571
Look what l did.

65
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,347
l mean, look at this mess.

66
00:04:34,553 --> 00:04:37,021
We're gonna probably have to
clean this up.

67
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:39,780
l mean, we're gonna have to reschedule!

68
00:04:40,926 --> 00:04:45,056
lf you thought that this mess
was gonna bother me, you are wrong!

69
00:04:45,297 --> 00:04:47,128
All right, let's go, Blinky.

70
00:04:58,877 --> 00:05:00,742
Hey, Joey. What's up?

71
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,447
l can't decide which route
to take to Vegas.

72
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:06,549
You've traveled a lot, right?

73
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:08,412
Yeah, l've been around.

74
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,953
Which route should l take?
The north or the south route?

75
00:05:12,157 --> 00:05:15,752
lf you take the north route,
there's a man with a beard of bees.

76
00:05:17,596 --> 00:05:20,429
Great! Problem solved!

77
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:24,630
On the south route, there's a chicken
that plays tic-tac-toe.

78
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:28,130
Well, back to square one.

79
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:30,941
l know a way that you can decide.

80
00:05:31,176 --> 00:05:35,408
l'll ask you a series of questions
and you answer as quickly as you can.

81
00:05:35,614 --> 00:05:36,740
Yes!

82
00:05:36,982 --> 00:05:38,074
Good. But wait.

83
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:42,276
Here we go. l want you to relax.

84
00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:44,481
Take a deep breath.

85
00:05:44,756 --> 00:05:46,849
Clear your mind.

86
00:05:47,092 --> 00:05:49,356
-Peanut butter or egg whites?
-Peanut butter.

87
00:05:49,628 --> 00:05:51,755
-Be a fireman or a swimmer?
-Swimmer.

88
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:55,524
-You'd sleep with Monica or Rachel?
-Monica.

89
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:58,833
l always thought it'd be Rachel.

90
00:05:59,037 --> 00:06:01,665
-No thinking. Tie or ascot?
-Ascot.

91
00:06:01,873 --> 00:06:03,340
-North or south route?
-North.

92
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,839
Bam! There you go! Huh?

93
00:06:06,544 --> 00:06:10,503
That was incredible!
Beard of bees here l come!

94
00:06:13,318 --> 00:06:15,309
This guy again.

95
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:19,318
Hey, what's up?

96
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:21,855
Not much. Wanna see a movie tonight?

97
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,459
What do you wanna see?

98
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:24,786
l don't know.

99
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,555
l know how to decide.
Show him your game.

100
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:29,289
No, thank you.

101
00:06:31,336 --> 00:06:32,360
What's with her?

102
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,697
l don't know.
l know how we can decide.

103
00:06:34,906 --> 00:06:38,034
l'm gonna ask you questions
and you answer real quick.

104
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:39,867
-Action or comedy?
-Action.

105
00:06:40,078 --> 00:06:42,876
Who would you rather sleep with,
Monica or Rachel?

106
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,310
Dude, you are sick.

107
00:06:52,424 --> 00:06:55,723
l'm sorry. l forgot you had
that whole Rachel thing.

108
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,328
Oh, my God. What does that thing do?

109
00:07:06,271 --> 00:07:08,739
-An eye removal machine.
-l'm out of here.

110
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,567
l'm kidding.

111
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:12,436
Rachel, l'm Dr. Miller.

112
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:15,908
Monica said you were nervous.
Everything will be fine.

113
00:07:16,147 --> 00:07:19,310
-So we're done.
-Almost, but first we gotta start.

114
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:22,711
This is a glaucoma test. Sit down.

115
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:26,053
Put your chin here.

116
00:07:26,825 --> 00:07:29,988
Now, you'll feel a small puff of air
in each eye.

117
00:07:30,295 --> 00:07:31,455
What?

118
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:35,225
A small puff of air.
Now, come on!

119
00:07:37,002 --> 00:07:38,333
Here we go.

120
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:42,295
One, two, three.

121
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:45,309
l'm sorry. All right.

122
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,138
l'm gonna stay in here this time.

123
00:07:48,446 --> 00:07:49,435
Ready?

124
00:07:49,647 --> 00:07:52,616
-One, two--
-l'm sorry.

125
00:07:52,817 --> 00:07:55,411
You know what?
l'm gonna hold her head.

126
00:07:55,653 --> 00:07:57,120
That's okay.

127
00:08:01,526 --> 00:08:03,153
l'm sorry.

128
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:05,659
You're young.
You don't have glaucoma.

129
00:08:09,934 --> 00:08:12,994
So it was very, very nice
to meet you, sir.

130
00:08:13,204 --> 00:08:15,331
What are you--?
Are you crazy?

131
00:08:15,774 --> 00:08:19,301
You got a small, minor infection
in that left eye.

132
00:08:19,544 --> 00:08:23,207
Take these drops for a week
and you'll be as good as new.

133
00:08:23,448 --> 00:08:25,678
No, l don't put things in my eye.

134
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:30,617
We'll see you here in three months.
And l'll fit you for a glass eye.

135
00:08:30,822 --> 00:08:32,449
Give me the damn drops!

136
00:08:34,392 --> 00:08:35,654
Dr. Miller?

137
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:38,628
P-E-C-F-D.

138
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:42,632
Very good, Monica!

139
00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:46,894
-You know where they are.
-l sure do.

140
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,573
And you don't get one.

141
00:08:57,248 --> 00:08:59,716
You know, those eye drops
are a miracle.

142
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:01,749
My eye is 1 00 percent better.

143
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,250
-They're still in my coat.
-Damn!

144
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:07,149
You ready to go?

145
00:09:07,358 --> 00:09:11,317
How cold will it be there?
Will all these sweater vests be enough?

146
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:14,725
-What?
-l love you.

147
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:20,035
l wish Ross was coming with us.
l'll miss him.

148
00:09:20,238 --> 00:09:23,071
Thanks. l just got
that jerk out of my mind.

149
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:27,568
ls the movie putting us up
in a big hotel suite?

150
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,906
Not really.
lt's an independent film.

151
00:09:30,115 --> 00:09:33,209
We don't have a big budget.
l'll stay in your room.

152
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:38,081
Once you get paid,
you'll be springing for a suite.

153
00:09:38,356 --> 00:09:40,347
They must be paying you a lot.

154
00:09:40,592 --> 00:09:43,584
For every dollar <i>Shutterspeed</i> makes...

155
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:47,023
...one penny of it goes
right in Joey's pocket.

156
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:50,198
You don't get paid unless
it makes money?

157
00:09:50,869 --> 00:09:53,895
Did you not hear the plot
of the movie?

158
00:09:54,572 --> 00:09:57,871
''She's been dead for 1 0 years.''

159
00:09:58,076 --> 00:10:00,135
l'm gonna be a millionaire!

160
00:10:02,547 --> 00:10:04,139
l wanted to say goodbye.

161
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,714
And to see if you guys would
place a little bet for me.

162
00:10:07,986 --> 00:10:10,284
Twenty bucks on black 1 5.

163
00:10:10,488 --> 00:10:12,046
-You got it!
-All right.

164
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,028
-You remember the number, right?
-Yeah, black 1 3.

165
00:10:18,196 --> 00:10:21,290
-Black 1 5!
-You got it.

166
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:24,933
-All right. Bye-bye, now.
-Bye, you guys.

167
00:10:25,203 --> 00:10:26,795
l'll say bye at the car.

168
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:30,267
Anyone wanna say bye to me
at the car?

169
00:10:30,475 --> 00:10:34,605
l'll say goodbye to you at the car
if you don't mind the pus.

170
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:38,070
See you!

171
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:42,885
But wait a minute. The pus is good.
lt means it's healing.

172
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:49,117
Hey, Pheebs. What you reading?

173
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:56,227
Hello?

174
00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:04,901
Come on!

175
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:06,906
Sorry, l didn't see you there.

176
00:11:09,347 --> 00:11:12,180
Pheebs, are you mad at me
or something?

177
00:11:12,483 --> 00:11:14,974
lf you are, please tell me
what it is l did.

178
00:11:15,253 --> 00:11:17,915
-lf you don't know, l can't help you.
-l don't know.

179
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:19,987
Well, l can't help you.

180
00:11:21,192 --> 00:11:25,754
Well, whatever it is,
l am very, very sorry. Okay?

181
00:11:26,998 --> 00:11:28,158
Apology accepted.

182
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:31,661
So we're good?

183
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:38,802
l'll see you later, okay?

184
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,034
Bye, fat-ass.

185
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:41,711
All right!

186
00:11:43,214 --> 00:11:46,945
Will you please tell me what it is
that made you so mad at me?

187
00:11:47,151 --> 00:11:49,984
l don't know! l don't remember!

188
00:11:51,022 --> 00:11:53,081
What do you mean, you can't remember?

189
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:58,059
l was so focused on being mad at you,
l forgot what it was l was mad about.

190
00:11:59,297 --> 00:12:02,630
lf you can't remember,
can't we just forget about this?

191
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:06,065
Oh, no. l am mad at you.
l know that much.

192
00:12:06,337 --> 00:12:11,240
But l'm sorry about the fat-ass thing
because you have a sweet, little heinie.

193
00:12:20,018 --> 00:12:23,784
l'm getting pretty tired.
You'll have to take over soon.

194
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:28,352
We've been driving for a half-hour.
You haven't looked at the road once.

195
00:12:28,626 --> 00:12:31,094
Don't worry. lt's out there.

196
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:35,463
Maybe l just need lunch.
You wanna eat?

197
00:12:36,134 --> 00:12:37,692
My treat.

198
00:12:38,803 --> 00:12:40,668
lsn't that Ross' money?

199
00:12:43,107 --> 00:12:45,507
Ross' treat.
Where do you wanna eat?

200
00:12:45,777 --> 00:12:46,869
l don't know.

201
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:48,806
l know how we can decide.

202
00:12:49,013 --> 00:12:50,947
l'll ask you questions.

203
00:12:51,215 --> 00:12:53,615
And then you have to answer real fast.

204
00:12:53,851 --> 00:12:57,287
So clear your mind.
Clear it right out. Clear it out.

205
00:12:57,822 --> 00:13:02,521
lt's all clear except for this image
of a small, purple lamp.

206
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:05,219
ls that all right if that stays in there?

207
00:13:05,997 --> 00:13:08,397
l don't see why not. l guess.

208
00:13:08,566 --> 00:13:12,468
You have to answer with the first thing
that pops into your head, okay?

209
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,297
-Would you rather be too wet or too dry?
-Too dry.

210
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:16,663
-Do you believe in ghosts?
-No.

211
00:13:16,874 --> 00:13:19,035
-Will this movie be my big break?
-No.

212
00:13:20,611 --> 00:13:23,171
-What?
-Yes.

213
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:26,980
-Dude, you said, no.
-l also said, yes.

214
00:13:27,218 --> 00:13:29,880
-This won't be my big break?
-No.

215
00:13:32,857 --> 00:13:34,324
l don't believe this.

216
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:38,117
Look, l just don't want you to get
your hopes up too high.

217
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:41,321
What are you talking about?
l'm the lead in a movie!

218
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:45,696
They're not even paying you!
This doesn't sound like a real movie!

219
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,962
l don't know why you're dumping
all over my big break.

220
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:51,971
l don't think this is gonna be
your big break.

221
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:54,906
Are you on this trip
to make me feel like a loser?

222
00:13:55,246 --> 00:13:58,010
-l'd rather be alone.
-You don't want me here?

223
00:13:58,216 --> 00:13:59,581
Not if you're like this.

224
00:13:59,817 --> 00:14:02,843
The next time you ask me
a question like that, l'll lie.

225
00:14:03,154 --> 00:14:04,815
l don't want you on the trip.

226
00:14:05,022 --> 00:14:07,547
Why don't you pull over.
l'll get out now.

227
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:09,315
Fine.

228
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:12,752
Get out.

229
00:14:12,997 --> 00:14:14,760
You can't stop on a bridge.

230
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:16,830
-Get out!
-Fine!

231
00:14:19,904 --> 00:14:22,270
<i>Wait! Wait! There's no sidewalk!</i>

232
00:14:22,507 --> 00:14:24,941
<i>Yeah. I'm gonna die here.</i>

233
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:31,610
Are you mad at me
because my hair gel smells?

234
00:14:33,451 --> 00:14:36,852
Because l said your handwriting
is childlike?

235
00:14:37,054 --> 00:14:39,386
No. That made me feel precious.

236
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,226
Because he's always
correcting people's grammar?

237
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:46,624
''Whom, whom.'' Sometimes it's ''who'' !

238
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:50,064
Yeah? Sometimes it's:

239
00:14:53,104 --> 00:14:57,165
Did you beat him at a board game?
He's such a baby when he loses.

240
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,637
Okay, l'm the baby.

241
00:14:58,943 --> 00:15:00,535
Hey! Stop it!

242
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:04,308
What are you doing here?

243
00:15:04,582 --> 00:15:06,948
Joey kicked me out of the car
on the bridge.

244
00:15:07,151 --> 00:15:09,244
-Why?
-l don't know. He went crazy.

245
00:15:09,454 --> 00:15:12,981
We played that game where you
ask questions and answer fast.

246
00:15:13,224 --> 00:15:16,625
That game should not be played
without my supervision.

247
00:15:17,995 --> 00:15:19,485
l don't know what made him mad.

248
00:15:19,764 --> 00:15:22,631
All l said was that
this wouldn't be his big break...

249
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,061
...that it wouldn't do
anything for him...

250
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:26,998
...and that it didn't sound real.

251
00:15:27,238 --> 00:15:30,002
Okay, he should've
pushed me off the bridge.

252
00:15:30,241 --> 00:15:31,265
What's in the bag?

253
00:15:31,476 --> 00:15:33,103
l figured you'd be mad at me...

254
00:15:33,344 --> 00:15:36,177
...so l got gifts that l found
on the roadside.

255
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:39,172
-Who wants the one-legged teddy bear?
-l do!

256
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:52,551
-Not even close.
-l need help! l can't do this.

257
00:15:52,763 --> 00:15:54,094
Come on. Let's do it.

258
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,257
Sit down.
All right, put your head back.

259
00:15:59,937 --> 00:16:02,633
-Now open your eyes.
-Okay, they are.

260
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:06,977
-How many fingers am l holding up?
-Four.

261
00:16:07,178 --> 00:16:08,440
l was thinking four.

262
00:16:08,646 --> 00:16:10,739
-Really?
-Yes!

263
00:16:10,982 --> 00:16:13,951
Why don't we start
with a practice one.

264
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:16,449
-No drops.
-Great!

265
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:21,421
On three. One, two, three.

266
00:16:22,426 --> 00:16:23,757
My pillow's all wet!

267
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:25,952
Well, you said it was practice!

268
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:27,255
Why did you move?

269
00:16:27,498 --> 00:16:28,829
l knew you were lying!

270
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:33,434
-Come here.
-What are you doing?

271
00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:35,730
Stop it! Oh, my God!

272
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,805
l am going....

273
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:39,838
Turn it over!

274
00:16:40,111 --> 00:16:42,011
l am going to get...

275
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:45,142
...get these drops in your eye.

276
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:48,614
Oh, my God! You really are
freakishly strong.

277
00:16:49,987 --> 00:16:51,511
Stop! Stop!

278
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:53,256
Stop it!

279
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,252
Damn, it's empty!

280
00:16:56,827 --> 00:17:00,593
lf Joey and Chandler walked in now,
we could make a fortune.

281
00:17:07,438 --> 00:17:09,497
That is definitely Chandler,
Joey or Ross.

282
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:11,130
Or Rachel.

283
00:17:15,613 --> 00:17:16,978
lt's Joey.

284
00:17:18,683 --> 00:17:21,846
Chandler told me what happened.
He's really upset.

285
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,882
Not as upset as he'll be when he finds
out what l did with his sweater vests.

286
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,359
What did you do to them?

287
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:33,223
There's a well-dressed
pack of dogs in Ohio.

288
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:39,503
l gotta ask Phoebe
something about the car.

289
00:17:39,737 --> 00:17:41,170
<i>Hold on one second.</i>

290
00:17:41,872 --> 00:17:43,897
-Hey, dude.
-<i>Hey, Pheebs.</i>

291
00:17:44,175 --> 00:17:47,167
This wooden box keeps sliding out.
What is it?

292
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:48,403
My grandma.

293
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,749
And thanks.
She's having a great time.

294
00:17:57,421 --> 00:17:59,753
ls that Joey? Let me talk to him.

295
00:18:00,057 --> 00:18:02,651
Chandler's here.
He was wondering if--

296
00:18:02,893 --> 00:18:05,760
l guess he ran out of change.

297
00:18:06,497 --> 00:18:10,399
How am l gonna apologize to him
if he won't even talk to me?

298
00:18:10,601 --> 00:18:14,731
Send him something. So when he
gets there, he'll know you're sorry.

299
00:18:14,939 --> 00:18:19,342
That's a good idea. l wonder where
l could get a basket of porn?

300
00:18:20,778 --> 00:18:23,008
No, don't say, ''l'm sorry,'' with porn.

301
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:26,682
You should send him
a carton of cigarettes.

302
00:18:26,951 --> 00:18:30,011
Because that way he can trade it
for protection.

303
00:18:30,254 --> 00:18:31,516
No. That's prison.

304
00:18:35,526 --> 00:18:37,892
l know how we're gonna
figure this out.

305
00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:39,357
Clear your mind...

306
00:18:39,597 --> 00:18:43,055
...and answer the first thing
that comes into your head.

307
00:18:44,568 --> 00:18:46,798
-Do you like flora or fauna?
-Fauna.

308
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:48,562
-Simon or Garfunkel?
-Garfunkel.

309
00:18:48,873 --> 00:18:51,398
-Why are you mad?
-You said l was boring.

310
00:18:54,412 --> 00:18:55,902
When did l say that?

311
00:18:56,147 --> 00:18:59,207
Oh, my God! l remember now!
We were playing chess.

312
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,385
Phoebe, you and l
have never played chess.

313
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:07,751
Remember that time on the frozen lake?
We were playing. You said l was boring.

314
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:11,894
Then you took off your energy mask
and you were Cameron Diaz.

315
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:17,467
There's a chance this
may have been a dream.

316
00:19:20,504 --> 00:19:27,034
So this entire time, you've been
angry with me because of a dream?

317
00:19:27,311 --> 00:19:30,439
Well, guess what, now l'm mad at you.

318
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:35,646
l wanted to make sure this wasn't a dream.

319
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,651
Otherwise we're wasting our time.

320
00:20:07,251 --> 00:20:08,513
Stanley!

321
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:12,647
Your leading man is here.
Let's get to work.

322
00:20:13,157 --> 00:20:14,590
Slight change of plans.

323
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:16,258
We've shut down.

324
00:20:17,194 --> 00:20:18,456
What? Why?

325
00:20:18,662 --> 00:20:21,153
lt's a money thing.
We don't have any.

326
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:25,358
You're kidding, right?

327
00:20:26,203 --> 00:20:27,192
What?

328
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:29,766
lt's probably just temporary.

329
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,339
We're hoping to get some money soon.
Just hang out.

330
00:20:33,577 --> 00:20:35,511
Hang out? How long?

331
00:20:35,746 --> 00:20:39,409
l don't know. A week. Maybe two.
The money will turn up.

332
00:20:39,617 --> 00:20:43,053
People always wanna invest in movies.
You're not rich?

333
00:20:44,021 --> 00:20:45,045
Worth a shot.

334
00:20:46,924 --> 00:20:50,189
Well, Joey, let me know
where you're staying, okay?

335
00:20:52,763 --> 00:20:55,425
Hey, pal. Are you Joey Tribbiani?

336
00:20:55,699 --> 00:20:57,132
These got left for you.

337
00:20:57,368 --> 00:20:58,960
Thanks.

338
00:21:00,271 --> 00:21:03,729
''Congratulations on your big break.''

339
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:38,767
-<i>Monica, it's Joey.</i>
-Hey, Joey.

340
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:41,409
You remember me
