1
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:04,795
Hey.

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,046
- Hey.
- Hey.

3
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:07,423
Listen, uh...

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,758
You think I have a chance with Janine?

5
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:11,844
Ugh, we've been through this.

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,429
Don't do this to yourself.

7
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:16,015
She made it clear it isn't
going to happen.

8
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,727
All right, then. I guess I shouldn't
get too excited about the fact...

9
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:21,520
...that I just kissed her!

10
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,273
- Are you serious?
- That's great!

11
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,899
Yeah, well, we'll see.

12
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,069
You kissed her?

13
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:32,031
Oh, we kissed it up real nice.

14
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,950
So you kissed. Then what happened?

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,953
I came over here to tell you guys.

16
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,873
So she's waiting over
there for you?

17
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,168
Yeah.

18
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,091
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

19
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,762
I'm gonna be late
for dance class.

20
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,680
Okay.

21
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,185
- Okay, now I'm really leaving.
- All right.

22
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,520
But can you just...

23
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,897
...just leave your lips?

24
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,901
- Bye.
- Bye.

25
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,905
Have you kissed her yet?

26
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,325
It's awesome!

27
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,035
I could do it forever.

28
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:04,998
You know what? She kisses better
than my mom cooks.

29
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,669
- I'm so glad you said "cooks."
- Right?

30
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:13,465
Rachel, you've got to tell
the post office that you've moved.

31
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,843
We still get your bills and stuff.

32
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,555
Oh! Oh! Pottery Barn!
You can throw the rest away.

33
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,765
I'm not your garbage man.

34
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,060
I'm your mailman.

35
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,604
Monica, look.

36
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,649
Here is that table that I ordered. Ah!

37
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:35,112
- You got it from Pottery Barn?
- Yeah. It's an apothecary table.

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,656
Does anyone even know what
an apothecary is?

39
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,575
A pharmacist.

40
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,411
A pharmacist.

41
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,456
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.

42
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,083
I hate Pottery Barn too.

43
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,503
They kicked me out just
because I sat on a bed.

44
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,381
You took off your pants
and got under the sheets.

45
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,385
I was tired.

46
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,222
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?

47
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,433
She hates mass-produced stuff.

48
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,603
She thinks her furniture
should have a story behind it.

49
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,813
This has a story behind it.

50
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:14,401
They had to ship it all the way
from the White Plains store.

51
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,406
It's got to be one-of-a-kind.

52
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:23,619
Like that God-awful ceramic fruit
bowl she has on her counter?

53
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,622
Hey! I made that for her.

54
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,791
- You made pottery?
- Yeah.

55
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,878
I made it out of a fruit bowl
I found in the garbage.

56
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:38,508
If you put that in her apartment,
you'll never hear the end of it.

57
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,261
I'll tell her that it's an antique.

58
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,430
She doesn't have to know
where it came from.

59
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,183
Ah, I love these little drawers.

60
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,436
Oh, look!
It says that it holds 300 CDs.

61
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,898
Ah, just like the apothecary tables
of yore.

62
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,989
So the farmer says:

63
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,991
"That's not a cow,
and you're not milking."

64
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,913
I'm so glad you're together.

65
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,416
We wanted a couple to go out with
and now we have one.

66
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,502
We're a couple of couples.

67
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,547
I had so much fun tonight.
What a great restaurant!

68
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,927
And Chandler, I can't believe
I let you pay for this one.

69
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,681
Thanks again, man.

70
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:30,060
If you come over tomorrow,
I'll make pasta.

71
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,645
- That'd be great!
- Okay.

72
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,314
But at least let us
bring the wine.

73
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,818
- You don't have to.
- Ah, I insist.

74
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,614
- You'll get the wine, right?
- Yeah.

75
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,244
- Okay, good night.
- See you tomorrow.

76
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,121
Can't wait.

77
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,670
How are we going to get
out of that one?

78
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,843
- What?
- I can't handle two nights in a row...

79
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,636
...with them.

80
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,180
What's wrong with them?

81
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,974
They're just a little...

82
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,600
...blah!

83
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,228
Blah?

84
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:17,524
Well, you know, he's blah.
She's just...

85
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,485
She's very loud for such
a small person.

86
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,116
Uh, they're my best friends.

87
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:30,037
Are you saying we can't go out?
'Cause that'd be a problem.

88
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,331
Of course we can still
hang out with them.

89
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,208
Just not two nights in a row.

90
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,255
- Okay?
- I guess.

91
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,132
Thank you.

92
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,638
I'll sell my friends and use
the money to buy you presents.

93
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,730
- Hey.
- Hey.

94
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:01,693
Ooh! What a great table!
Where did you get it?

95
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,070
Guess.

96
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,448
Um, a flea market?

97
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:10,827
Ha, I knew you would get it
on the first guess.

98
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,163
Isn't it cool?
It's an apothecary table.

99
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,290
Ah, wow.

100
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,585
You can just imagine
that this is where...

101
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,088
...they kept all their stuff
to make potions.

102
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,297
- You know?
- Ooh, yes.

103
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,842
Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.

104
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,887
Almost.

105
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,389
Oh, how much was it?

106
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,265
Just only 500 bucks.

107
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,101
500 bucks at a flea market?

108
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,938
I thought you meant how much was it...

109
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,023
...when it was new, back then.

110
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,483
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, no.

111
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,694
It was at a flea market,
so it was like a dollar.

112
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,408
- A dollar?
- And fifty?

113
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,244
So it was like
one and fifty dollars.

114
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,081
- They gave you the old-time pricing.
- Yeah.

115
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,167
Well, what period is it from?

116
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,961
Uh, it's from yore.

117
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,380
Like, the "days of yore," you know?

118
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,757
Yes. Yes, I do.

119
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,219
- It's just perfect.
- Oh, good.

120
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,596
I bet it has a great story too.

121
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,890
Did they tell you
where it's from or...

122
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,935
Yes, that I know.
This is from, uh, White Plains.

123
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,522
- White Plains.
- Mm-hm.

124
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,608
Ooh, it sounds like
such a magical place.

125
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,240
- I'm here.
- Hi!

126
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,326
Oh, my God!

127
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,287
- You like it?
- Oh, my God!

128
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,165
It's my new apothecary table!

129
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,626
Phoebe'll be here any second.
She can't see this.

130
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,504
Why not? She'll love it.
It's the real thing.

131
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,465
I got it at Pottery Barn.

132
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,509
I know. I bought the same one.

133
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,304
And if she sees your table,
she'll know I lied.

134
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,390
- I said ours was an original.
- Why?

135
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,559
Because she hates Pottery Barn.

136
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,104
She hates Pottery Barn?

137
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,857
She says it's all mass-produced...

138
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,360
...nothing is authentic, and everyone
winds up having the same stuff.

139
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,742
So come on!
Can we cover this up, please?

140
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,035
What? No, no.

141
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,454
I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe.

142
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,332
Although I did get some great
Pottery Barn sheets.

143
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,377
Ooh, I forgot they made sheets!

144
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,630
Heh, yeah.

145
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,343
I still can't believe
she hates Pottery Barn.

146
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,053
It's not like she hates you.

147
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,430
Yeah, but Pottery Barn?

148
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,810
You know what I think?
She's just weird.

149
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:44,356
It's because she's a twin.
Twins are weird.

150
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:49,069
She's not weird. She likes
her stuff to be one-of-a-kind.

151
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:53,823
Huh. You know what's
not one-of-a-kind? A twin!

152
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,373
Let's turn out the lights
and watch the movie.

153
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:05,252
- Hey, ooh, cool sheet!
- You like it?

154
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,213
- You want to know where I got it?
- Sure.

155
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,798
At a flea market.

156
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,094
You buy your sheets
at a flea market?

157
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,889
Come on, you gotta loosen the
purse strings a little.

158
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,518
- Hey.
- Hey.

159
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,062
Dinner will be ready in 20 minutes.

160
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,898
Here is the wine to bring
over tonight.

161
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,360
You were also gonna
buy Monica flowers...

162
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,488
...but you couldn't because
you paid for dinner last night.

163
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:38,118
Thanks. But, uh, it's just
gonna be me tonight.

164
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:42,080
- What happened to Janine?
- She's, uh, really sick.

165
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,792
- That's too bad.
- Yeah, she's been in there all day.

166
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,671
Uh, high fever, nose problem. It's...

167
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,923
...phlegm, phlegm,
phlegm, phlegm, phlegm.

168
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,344
Monica! Chandler!

169
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,933
I'm sorry about tonight.
I don't know if Joey told you...

170
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,270
...but I couldn't get out
of going to this play.

171
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:10,233
Have a great time, huh?

172
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,573
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.

173
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,996
Oh, no, she really is sick.

174
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,123
Then why is she going to a play?

175
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,626
Uh, well, you know, "Starve a fever...

176
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,711
...go to a play for a cold."

177
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,799
Why is Janine not coming
over for dinner?

178
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,637
Uh, she didn't want to hang out with
you guys two nights in a row.

179
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,472
I'm so sorry.

180
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,600
Why doesn't she want
to hang out with us?

181
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:48,897
Because she, uh, thinks that
you are "blah."

182
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,777
And that, uh, you, Monica,
are too loud.

183
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,445
What?!

184
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,115
What?

185
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,451
So she just pretended to
have a good time?

186
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,036
She was lying to our faces?

187
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,080
I can't believe this.

188
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,289
Who is she to judge us?

189
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:10,835
- We couldn't have been nicer to her.
- And I am not "blah." I am a hoot!

190
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,045
I know, I know.

191
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,589
Come on, please, you guys.
Don't be mad.

192
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,591
I'm sure she said it...

193
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,053
...because she was nervous 'cause
you're my best friends.

194
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,389
And it was our first date.

195
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,350
Plus, she's really sick.

196
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,479
You said you made that up!

197
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,565
But isn't the "sick" thing
better than the "play" thing?

198
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,986
They're both good. I generally just
go with, "Monica's drunk again."

199
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,534
Come on, please just
give her another chance.

200
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,287
- She'll come around, I promise.
- Of course we will.

201
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,082
- Come on, we gotta make dinner.
- Okay.

202
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,130
I do not like that woman!

203
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,549
I can hear you!

204
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,093
I am loud!

205
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,181
Aw.

206
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,396
Isn't it good?

207
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,733
Can you please not put your
feet up on my new...

208
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,735
...old sheet.

209
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,778
Oh, sure.

210
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,948
My apothecary table!

211
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,743
- What?
- No!

212
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,747
- Where did you get this?
- At Pottery Barn, okay?

213
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,251
Oh, my God!

214
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,797
Pottery Barn has ripped off
the design of our antique!

215
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:42,343
Wow. If they've ripped off our table...

216
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,513
...ours must be worth much more
than one and fifty dollars.

217
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,018
This doesn't even
smell like opium.

218
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,188
It smells like wine,
which you spilled.

219
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,356
And thanks for wrecking my sheet.

220
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:59,569
Ross, calm down.
I'll give you the 80 cents.

221
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,534
Okay, one more time.

222
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,411
Would you like some orange juice?

223
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:12,165
- Perfect decibel.
- I know!

224
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,460
Hey.

225
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,712
Uh, what are you guys doing?

226
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,424
Nothing. We're just talking.
You know, blah-blah-blah.

227
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,220
Come on, you said you were gonna try.

228
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:29,057
I came over to invite you to
a movie with me and Janine.

229
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,767
- What do you say?
- I'd like to...

230
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,353
...but I'm not sure if we have the time.

231
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,106
Ha, very funny. I don't know
what to do.

232
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,234
I really want you to get along.

233
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,195
Please, come to the movie with us.
You owe me.

234
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,113
- We owe you?
- That's right.

235
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,367
I helped you out in the
start of your relationship.

236
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,744
I helped you sneak around
for six months.

237
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,412
I looked like an idiot.

238
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,414
And I was humiliated.

239
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,291
And I only made $200.

240
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,879
We didn't give you any money.

241
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,884
You don't think I know that?

242
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,559
I can't decide if it goes
better by the new chair...

243
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,768
...the Sahara desk...

244
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,187
...or the Parker console table.

245
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,773
I didn't know there was
a Pottery Barn up here.

246
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,527
- I know, I went a little crazy.
- A little?

247
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,572
Your place looks like page 72
of the catalog.

248
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,283
Look at that!

249
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,579
- The ornamental birdcage! Large.
- Ha, ha.

250
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,501
Oh, Ross? Be careful.
That is very old.

251
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:42,964
Colonial bird merchants used to
bring their birds to market in that.

252
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,508
Fascinating.

253
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,347
Another amazing find! Wow.

254
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,976
- I bet this has a great story too.
- It does.

255
00:14:55,144 --> 00:15:00,148
It is a room-separating apparatus
from Colonial times.

256
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,611
Huh, a lot of this stuff is from
the Colonial times.

257
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,822
What are some other
time periods, Rachel?

258
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,826
Well, there's yore.

259
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,874
Ahem, and, uh, you know, yesteryear.

260
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,795
Rachel has such a
good eye for this stuff.

261
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,423
Ross, if you ever decide
to redecorate...

262
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,051
- and I think you should...

263
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,969
- you should ask Rachel to help.

264
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,679
Aw, he doesn't need my help.

265
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:35,141
I think he's ready to get rid
of the... What'd you call it?

266
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,644
The, uh, "cheap knockoffs
and dinosaur junk"?

267
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,275
Really?

268
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:49,530
You know, since you have such a
great sense of what I need...

269
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,574
Uh, here's 60 bucks.

270
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:55,703
Why don't you take Phoebe down
to that Colonial, uh, flea market...

271
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,413
...and get me some stuff?

272
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,587
I don't think Phoebe wants to come.

273
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,589
- I do want to.
- She does want to.

274
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,257
- She does want to.
- Yeah!

275
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,267
I guess the flea market
was just better last time.

276
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:21,354
Well, at least I got these
sheets for Ross.

277
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,400
Ugh, look at this. Pottery Barn.

278
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:29,112
Ugh, yeah, you know what?
Don't look at it.

279
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,781
- Seriously, don't look at it.
- Look!

280
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,158
There's the table
they stole from us.

281
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,285
Oh, those bastards! Let's go.

282
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,458
That fan kind of looks like ours,
and the birdcage, and...

283
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,795
Wait a second, this is our
exact living room!

284
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,131
No, it's not.

285
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,633
Come on, ours is totally different.

286
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:54,595
I mean, we don't have the...
We don't have that lamp.

287
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:59,767
And that screen is on
the other side.

288
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,938
Oh, my God. This is where you
got all our stuff.

289
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,108
- Pottery Barn! Oh, my God!
- No. No.

290
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,736
Okay, I did, all right?
I'm sorry.

291
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:13,990
I wanted this stuff and I know
how you feel about Pottery Barn.

292
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:17,076
- Come on, don't be mad.
- No, but I am mad.

293
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,329
Because this stuff is what's
wrong with the world...

294
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,874
...and it's in my living room...

295
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:27,003
...and all I can think about is
how I don't have that lamp!

296
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,131
Well, then, honey, buy the lamp.

297
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,633
We have that 60 bucks from Ross.

298
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,971
I can't! I can't!

299
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,098
Unless...

300
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:43,102
Are you saying you'd move out
if I didn't buy that lamp?

301
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,354
No, I'm not gonna move out!

302
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:49,484
But are you saying that you would
move out if I didn't buy that lamp?

303
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:54,280
- Yes! I would so move out.
- Then I don't have a choice.

304
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,825
- I have to buy that lamp!
- That's right.

305
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,828
But at least the apothecary
table's real.

306
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,921
This was great.
Didn't everybody have a great time?

307
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,757
I did. I really did.
And I've got to say...

308
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,469
...I'm sorry if I was weird after
the last time we went out.

309
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,387
I guess I was just nervous.

310
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,432
- That's understandable.
- Don't worry about it.

311
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,850
So we can go out again?

312
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,644
- Absolutely.
- Well, good.

313
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,063
- Okay, well, good night.
- Good night.

314
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,277
See, huh?

315
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,695
Wasn't that fun?

316
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,781
We have got to move.

317
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,991
What?

318
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,493
I knew it!

319
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,705
You're not so quiet yourself, missy!

320
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,585
I'm blah? The only thing more
boring than modern dance...

321
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,129
...is you talking about it.

322
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,755
"Oh, Chandler...

323
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,966
...I just lost myself in the movement."

324
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,346
You know, I know you're talking...

325
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,349
...but all I hear is
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

326
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,894
All right, you and me!
Let's go, right now!

327
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,396
All right, enough!

328
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,608
Enough! You two, go home.
I gotta talk to Janine.

329
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,236
I really think you could take her.

330
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,989
You better hope I don't
see you in the hallway!

331
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,121
All right. Uh...

332
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,999
Look, we got a little bit
of a problem here.

333
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,626
You can't my treat
my friends that way.

334
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:35,381
- They said stuff to me too.
- I know, I'll talk to them about it.

335
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,258
They mean so much to me.

336
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,719
They're like my family, you know?

337
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,055
If you guys are gonna be
fighting all the time...

338
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:48,311
I don't think we can be together.
It just can't work, okay?

339
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,645
It can't.

340
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,606
I'm very upset.

341
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,817
Okay.

342
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,278
Would it help if I apologized?

343
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,155
Yeah.

344
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,115
That'd be very helpful.

345
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,789
What did I tell you about the hall?

346
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,878
I was coming over to
apologize for my behavior.

347
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,090
I'd really like it if we
could be friends.

348
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:24,931
Well, I know that would
make Joey happy, so...

349
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,225
...I would like that too.

350
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,895
- Great.
- Now, come on.

351
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,359
- I'm glad we worked it out.
- Me too.

352
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,486
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

353
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,822
- Or I'll hear you.
- That's it, big girl!

354
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,493
Wait!

355
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,249
You'd better run!

356
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,126
Did you hear that?

357
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,964
- What am I gonna do?
- I'm sorry, man.

358
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,842
- Want to go watch?
- Yeah!

359
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,519
- Hey.
- Hey.

360
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,397
- How you doing?
- So, uh, did she move out?

361
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,399
Pretty much.

362
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,943
I can't believe you just
broke up with her.

363
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,195
When it's not right, you know it.

364
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,615
- You okay?
- I'll be all right.

365
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,953
- You know what'd cheer you up?
- What?

366
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:33,082
I'm giving this lecture on
erosion theories tomorrow night.

367
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,169
I think you should come.

368
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,304
You're right, that did cheer me up.
