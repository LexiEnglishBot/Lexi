00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:06,714
What? What did you... What?

2
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,300
I still love you.

3
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:13,971
I know I shouldn't even
be here telling you this.

4
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,432
You're with Chandler, a guy I really like.

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,600
You say he's straight, I'll believe you.

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,606
After seeing you, I knew if I didn't
tell you I'd always regret it.

7
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,943
Letting you go was
the stupidest thing I ever did.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,864
You're really not
supposed to be back here.

9
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:37,077
I'm sorry. I know this is
the wrong time and the wrong place...

10
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,121
...but I had to tell you.

11
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,166
I want to spend my life with you
and marry you.

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,753
I want to have kids with you.

13
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,631
Oh, my God.

14
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,301
Why don't they put chairs back here?

15
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:57,014
I know this is crazy, but am I too late?

16
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,976
Yes, you're too late.
Where was all this three years ago?

17
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,604
I know. I was an idiot.

18
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,190
And I tried to forget you. I really did.

19
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:11,236
After we had lunch last year,
I spent six months in Africa trying to forget.

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,823
- What were you doing in Africa?
- Working with blind kids.

21
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,534
What are you doing to me?

22
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,620
Look, I...

23
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:23,415
I'm sorry, but it's not gonna happen.

24
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:27,169
That's fine. I'll walk away.
And I'll never bother you again.

25
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,256
Only if you tell me Chandler's
willing to give you everything I am.

26
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,426
Well, he is. I mean...

27
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,970
...marriage is all he talks about.

28
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,263
My goodness.

29
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,100
In fact, I'm the one making him wait.

30
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,476
- You are?
- Yeah.

31
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,645
- Why?
- Why?

32
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,564
Because of the government.

Isn't it incredible?

34
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,611
Monica and Chandler
are getting married.

35
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,906
I know. They'll be so happy together.

36
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,034
Two best friends in love.
How often does that happen?

37
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,245
- Not that often.
- No.

38
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,831
I'm so happy for them.

39
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,500
Me too. So happy for them.

00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,587
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.

41
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:56,008
- Oh, no! God, definitely not jealous.
- Mm-mm.

42
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:04,725
I'm probably 98 percent happy
and maybe 2 percent jealous.

43
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,518
What's 2 percent? That's nothing.

44
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,270
Totally.

45
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,400
- I'm like 90-10.
- Yeah. Me too.

46
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,365
Hey, have you guys seen Chandler?

47
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,622
No. But you know who
was looking for you?

48
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,081
Tennille.

49
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,926
So that marriage stuff
you were saying yesterday?

50
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,720
- You don't really believe that.
- Sure, I do.

51
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:45,557
In fact, I think the whole concept
of marriage is unnatural.

52
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,561
Look at pigs. Let's take
a second here and look at pigs.

53
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,105
Pigs don't mate for life.

54
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,943
A pig can have 100 sexual partners
in a lifetime.

55
00:03:56,194 --> 00:04:00,197
And that's just an ordinary pig,
not even a pig that's good at sports.

56
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,699
Wait a minute.

57
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,870
Are you telling me
you may never want to get married?

58
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,623
Never say never, but, probably...

59
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,291
...yeah, never.

60
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,543
Oh, my God.

61
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,588
Then what are we even doing?
What is this?

62
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,217
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what is all this pressure?

63
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,552
Is this some new strategy?

64
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:26,515
Why don't you put down your copy
of The Rules, huh, man-trap?

65
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,018
You know what? I gotta go.

66
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,815
It's okay. I got a plan.

67
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,115
- We're gonna find love.
- Definitely.

68
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,327
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that.

69
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:52,124
That's what makes it so easy to be
80 percent happy for Monica and Chandler.

70
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,295
- Would be nice to have a guarantee.
- What do you mean?

71
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,797
Some people make deals with a friend.

72
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:03,635
Like if neither of them are married
by 40, they marry each other.

73
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,512
- You mean a backup?
- Exactly.

74
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,514
Yeah, yeah. I've got that.

75
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,517
- You do?
- Mm-hm.

76
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,019
- Who?
- Joey?

77
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,188
- Joey? Are you serious?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,107
Yeah, I locked him in years ago.

79
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:25,324
Wait. So if neither of you are
married by 40, you'll marry Joey?

80
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,284
Yep. We shook on it.

81
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,955
Yeah. But believe me, that is not
how he wanted to seal the deal.

82
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,666
Seriously?

83
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,835

Hey, Monica.

88
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,645
Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?

00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,940
It's for my boat. Cool, huh?

00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,859
Yeah, it's great.

I'm in a dead-end relationship.

Chandler's giving you a hard time?

94
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,498
I don't want to get married tomorrow.
But I want to believe...

95
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,751
...we're going somewhere,
that I'm not wasting my time.

96
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,088
- You know Chandler.
- No, I don't know Chandler.

97

Not anymore.
It's like something's changed.

98
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,927
Maybe you changed.

99
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,262
I didn't change.

100
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,390
Maybe that's the problem.

101
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,977
- What?
- Chandler is a complex fellow.

102
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,897
One who is unlikely to take a wife.

103
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,070
Does he think I'll just
wait around for nothing?

104
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:48,323
Face it. Chandler is against marriage.

105
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,575
And always will be.

- There are?
- Yeah. Richard.

108
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,584
Richard said he wants to marry you?

109

- And Chandler says he hates marriage?
- That's right.

we'd be able to make it work.

So, what do you say we make a pact?

If you and I are both single by 40,
we get married.

Hi.

00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,811
I don't know why I'm here.

00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,063
I didn't ask.

You want to come in?

I don't know.

Oh, okay.

I'll just leave the door open
and go sit on the couch.

- You still smoking cigars?
- Uh...

No, no. That's art.

Since we broke up, do you ever...

177

...think about me?

178
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,451
Actually, I thought about you
a couple months ago.

179
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,787
- Really?
- Yeah, but it's because I...

180

...had an eye exam,
and I don't like my new eye doctor.

- Edward Nevsky.

Of course I can.

You were both aware of the situation.

- No, we weren't!

And I'm going to write "Ross"
on the other napkin...

...and we'll pick one.
