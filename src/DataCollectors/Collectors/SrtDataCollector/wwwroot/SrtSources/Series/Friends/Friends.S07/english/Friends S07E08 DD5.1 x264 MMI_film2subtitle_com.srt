1
00:00:02,292 --> 00:00:05,767
- Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving.
- No, no, no.

2
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:08,790
What are we keeping Thanksgiving
a secret this year?

3
00:00:09,563 --> 00:00:11,152
We're playing a game
I learned.

4
00:00:11,407 --> 00:00:13,909
You have to name all the states
in six minutes.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,763
What? That's like insanely easy.

6
00:00:17,008 --> 00:00:19,511
It's harder than it sounds.
You always forget one.

7
00:00:19,827 --> 00:00:22,887
Or, in some cases, 14.

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,623
It's stupid and I wasn't playing against
people, so technically, I didn't lose.

9
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:30,886
You forgot 14 states?

10
00:00:31,168 --> 00:00:33,457
Nobody cares about the Dakotas!

11
00:00:34,856 --> 00:00:36,315
Okay, time's up.

12
00:00:36,597 --> 00:00:37,913
All right, I got 48.

13
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:39,620
That's not bad. Pheebs?

14
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:43,935
I got tired of naming states, so I
decided to list the types of celery.

15
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,102
And I have one, regular celery.

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,258
So Rachel's got 48,
and Phoebe has the lead in...

17
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:56,211
...vegetables. Joey?

18
00:00:56,636 --> 00:00:59,697
Say hello to the new champ
of Chandler's dumb states game.

19
00:01:00,637 --> 00:01:03,899
- Wow, how many you got?
- Fifty-six.

20
00:01:06,413 --> 00:01:10,647
The One Where Chandler
Doesn't Like Dogs

21
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:46,170
Hey, how is New England not a state?

22
00:01:46,736 --> 00:01:48,539
They have a sports team.

23
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:51,667
Does South Oregon have a sports team?

24
00:01:54,077 --> 00:01:55,500
There you go.

25
00:01:57,591 --> 00:01:59,500
How come we have
one extra place setting?

26
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,240
You invited your assistant.

27
00:02:01,523 --> 00:02:04,121
Oh, right, sorry. Tag's not coming.

28
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,222
His girlfriend came into town,
so he's with her.

29
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:08,444
Why didn't you tell me?

30
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,916
I made him his own individual
sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.

31
00:02:13,073 --> 00:02:15,220
I was going to,
but then I figured...

32
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:18,700
...your food is so delicious
and perfect...

33
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,250
...you can never have too many
of those pumpkin things.

34
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:27,578
You'd think I wouldn't enjoy that
because it is so fake, but I still do.

35
00:02:29,495 --> 00:02:30,526
Regular celery!

36
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:32,584
I already have that.

37
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,206
Done...

38
00:02:36,558 --> 00:02:38,503
...with time to spare.

39
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:43,411
- This may be a new world's record.
- I hate to lecture you guys...

40
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,273
...but it's disgraceful that
a group of well-educated adults...

41
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:52,177
...and Joey, can't name all the states.

42
00:02:52,457 --> 00:02:57,807
You ever see a map, or one of those
round, colorful things called a "globe"?

43
00:02:58,268 --> 00:03:02,088
Magellan? You got 46 states.

44
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:05,945
- What? That's impossible.
- Forty-six.

45
00:03:06,305 --> 00:03:09,638
Well, who's well-educated now,
Mr. L-Forgot-Ten-States?

46
00:03:11,697 --> 00:03:13,642
I'm going to go turn on Joey's oven.

47
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:16,877
Please, watch him.
Do not let Joey eat any of the food.

48
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,749
I am only one man.

49
00:03:21,057 --> 00:03:23,559
- Okay, time is up.
- Now, just give me another minute.

50
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:26,925
If you don't know them by now,
you will never know them, okay?

51
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,177
That is the beauty of this game.
It makes you want to kill yourself.

52
00:03:31,668 --> 00:03:33,685
This is crazy. I can do this.

53
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:37,368
All right, I bet I can get
all 50 before dinner.

54
00:03:37,687 --> 00:03:39,834
Okay, but if you can't, no dinner.

55
00:03:40,157 --> 00:03:41,473
You're on.

56
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:45,340
Don't look at my list, because there's
a lot on there that you don't have.

57
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,139
Did you know your oven doesn't work?

58
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:53,197
The drawer full of takeout
menus is okay, right?

59
00:03:54,421 --> 00:03:55,702
Ross, I'm gonna use yours.

60
00:03:58,145 --> 00:03:59,354
Chandler, give me a hand.

61
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,847
Joey, do not let Ross look at maps
or the globe in your apartment.

62
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:08,020
Don't worry.
It's not a globe of the United States.

63
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:18,392
I'm gonna go out and take a walk.

64
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:20,818
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?

65
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:23,645
- Oh, it's not.
- Seriously, it's moving.

66
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,295
- What the hell's in there?
- It's just my knitting. That's all.

67
00:04:33,145 --> 00:04:35,221
Yes, I knit this.

68
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:38,387
I'm very good.

69
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:46,223
Ross' apartment is nice.
How come we don't hang out here?

70
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,272
Maybe because it smells a weird.

71
00:04:48,558 --> 00:04:50,740
It's like old pumpkins or something.

72
00:04:51,272 --> 00:04:54,261
- That's my pie.
- Which smells delicious.

73
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,764
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- What?

74
00:04:56,978 --> 00:04:58,887
We left Joey alone with the food.

75
00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:01,357
Yep, yep, I knew it.

76
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,193
There he is...

77
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:06,544
...feeding stuffing to a dog!

78
00:05:12,286 --> 00:05:15,097
Hi, Geller-Bing residence.
How can I help?

79
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:17,920
Why is a dog in our apartment?

80
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,896
I'm sorry, who's this?

81
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:23,137
There's a dog sitting on my couch.

82
00:05:23,384 --> 00:05:26,445
Tell her I'm allergic, and I will sue!

83
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,965
- There's no dog here.
- Yes, there is!

84
00:05:31,282 --> 00:05:33,334
He's black and white and shaggy.

85
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:35,938
He's sitting next to Rachel
and licking her hand.

86
00:05:36,188 --> 00:05:38,619
Oh, my God! Where are you?

87
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,409
I'll be right there.

88
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:46,102
They're here already?
How are they doing this?!

89
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,373
Hi, Tag.
What are you doing here?

90
00:05:54,697 --> 00:05:57,852
I wanted to see if your offer
was still good.

91
00:05:58,106 --> 00:06:00,016
Well, sure. Come in.

92
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:02,941
Well, what happened
to your girlfriend?

93
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:05,332
We kind of broke up this morning.

94
00:06:05,587 --> 00:06:08,991
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.

95
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:11,813
Ohio, thank you.

96
00:06:16,615 --> 00:06:18,003
Where's the dog?

97
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,362
What dog? There's no dog here.

98
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:22,703
Yeah, that dog left.

99
00:06:27,714 --> 00:06:32,056
Wait a minute. I thought we
agreed to say... Your thing. Yeah.

100
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,918
Phoebe. Phoebe, open up.

101
00:06:36,098 --> 00:06:38,696
There's no dog in here.

102
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:43,744
Well, the hiding-the-dog plan
is off to a great start.

103
00:06:43,962 --> 00:06:46,594
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking.

104
00:06:46,814 --> 00:06:49,211
No, that's just me coughing.

105
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:55,929
Oh, good. There you are.

106
00:06:56,244 --> 00:06:59,269
Listen, I have a dog in my room.

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,353
What is it doing here?

108
00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:03,853
I'm watching it for friends
who went out of town.

109
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:05,314
Wait.

110
00:07:06,785 --> 00:07:09,490
Hello, my name is Klunkers.

111
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:12,836
May I please stay
with you nice people?

112
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,147
I wish he could stay here,
but Chandler's allergic.

113
00:07:17,397 --> 00:07:19,164
Extremely allergic, okay?

114
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:22,569
If I'm anywhere near a dog
for more than five minutes...

115
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,432
...my throat will just close up.

116
00:07:25,677 --> 00:07:29,153
That's odd. This dog's been
living here for the past three days.

117
00:07:35,384 --> 00:07:36,629
Really?

118
00:07:38,237 --> 00:07:39,660
If he's been here
that long...

119
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:43,203
...and you haven't had a reaction,
maybe you're not allergic to it.

120
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:45,044
It still has to go, right?

121
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,368
Why?

122
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:50,337
- Okay, it's...
- Don't do it!

123
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:54,306
- Don't do what?
- I have to.

124
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:56,807
Okay? It's time.

125
00:08:01,373 --> 00:08:02,654
Okay, I hate dogs.

126
00:08:02,904 --> 00:08:04,849
- What?!
- That's crazy? Why?

127
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:07,910
Told you.

128
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:14,170
They are needy...

129
00:08:14,455 --> 00:08:17,266
...jumpy, and you can't tell
what they are thinking...

130
00:08:17,586 --> 00:08:20,018
...and that scares me a little bit.

131
00:08:20,578 --> 00:08:23,283
You're right. They are scary.

132
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,834
She just ate a treat out of my hand!

133
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:32,536
So you're not allergic? I mean, does that
mean you're not allergic to wool either?

134
00:08:32,756 --> 00:08:35,673
You bought me
a pink turtleneck sweater.

135
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,207
The guy in the catalog pulled it off.

136
00:08:39,157 --> 00:08:41,066
Wait. Do you not like all dogs?

137
00:08:41,418 --> 00:08:42,771
I mean, not even puppies?

138
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:44,549
Is there a puppy here?

139
00:08:46,185 --> 00:08:48,996
- You don't like puppies?
- Okay, you are new.

140
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:57,308
Look, Chandler, I told you. Never
tell anyone about this dog thing.

141
00:08:57,597 --> 00:08:59,471
It's like Ross not liking ice cream.

142
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,345
- You don't like ice cream?
- It's too cold!

143
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:08,483
It's just that dogs make me
a little uncomfortable.

144
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,153
Hurts my teeth.

145
00:09:11,305 --> 00:09:13,321
And I don't want you guys
to hate me...

146
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:17,219
...but I don't think I can be around
that dog anymore, okay?

147
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,901
So either the dog goes or I go.

148
00:09:27,552 --> 00:09:29,390
Oh, my God!

149
00:09:33,746 --> 00:09:35,406
How can I not get this?

150
00:09:35,694 --> 00:09:39,169
I'm a college professor.
I got 1450 on my SATs.

151
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,801
Twelve-fifty.

152
00:09:42,026 --> 00:09:43,971
Damn, I forgot you were here.

153
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,895
We're gonna take Klunkers to Ross'.

154
00:09:47,245 --> 00:09:48,348
We'll be back in a minute.

155
00:09:48,636 --> 00:09:50,474
Before you go,
can I ask you a question?

156
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:53,500
When a guy breaks up
with his girlfriend...

157
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:57,783
...what is an appropriate amount
of time to wait before you make a move?

158
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,654
I'd say about a month.

159
00:09:59,944 --> 00:10:01,960
Really? I'd say three to four.

160
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:03,141
Half-hour.

161
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:08,846
Interesting.

162
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:11,454
When it's your assistant,
I'd say never.

163
00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:15,249
All right, Rach, the big question is,
does he like you?

164
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:19,421
Because if he doesn't like you,
this is all a moo point.

165
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,871
A "moo" point?

166
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:28,920
Yeah. It's like a cow's opinion.

167
00:10:29,969 --> 00:10:32,436
It just doesn't matter.

168
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:36,401
It's "moo."

169
00:10:42,946 --> 00:10:46,386
Have I been living with him for too
long, or did that all just make sense?

170
00:10:47,538 --> 00:10:48,677
Don't listen to Joey.

171
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:50,625
Okay, would you look at him?

172
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:53,583
He's obviously depressed.
He's away from his family.

173
00:10:53,905 --> 00:10:57,795
What he needs right now is
for you to be his friend.

174
00:10:58,046 --> 00:11:00,548
You're right. I'm sorry.
Thank you.

175
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:04,755
- Okay, that's what I'm going to do.
- Fine, take their advice.

176
00:11:05,073 --> 00:11:06,497
No one ever listens to me.

177
00:11:06,744 --> 00:11:10,184
When the package is this pretty,
no one cares what's inside.

178
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:27,089
Okay, I'm keeping my end of the deal.

179
00:11:27,305 --> 00:11:29,808
Why is the dog still here?

180
00:11:30,054 --> 00:11:33,008
- We're leaving.
- Okay.

181
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:35,686
- Come on.
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

182
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:39,227
I could pull this off, right?

183
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:46,397
- Hey.
- Hey.

184
00:11:46,615 --> 00:11:48,169
How you holding up?

185
00:11:48,598 --> 00:11:50,057
Not bad.

186
00:11:50,337 --> 00:11:53,528
- I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
- Thanks.

187
00:11:53,851 --> 00:11:58,015
- Were you guys together a long time?
- A year, on and off.

188
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,708
I kind of thought we'd end up together.
I don't anymore.

189
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:04,424
- Now that she broke up with you.
- Yeah.

190
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:07,348
It's weird.

191
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,008
I used to assume that I would meet
someone and fall in love and be happy.

192
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:16,253
That all that was just a given.
Lately, it's like, what if it's not?

193
00:12:17,022 --> 00:12:18,790
Do you ever have that feeling?

194
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,500
No.

195
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:22,162
Yeah.

196
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:25,507
All the time.
Constantly. It's terrifying.

197
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,981
But, you know, then I figure,
it has to work out.

198
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:30,998
Why?

199
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:33,826
Because it has to.

200
00:12:34,802 --> 00:12:38,621
- You really have all the answers, don't you?
- No, no, I do. I really do.

201
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:43,499
- Thanks for talking to me.
- Come on, what are bosses for?

202
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:45,095
Hug it out.

203
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:48,810
All right, he likes you back.

204
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:53,894
Told you, you should go for it.

205
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,542
What?

206
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:02,072
Street noise drown any of that out?

207
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,850
No? See you later.

208
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:06,148
Okay.

209
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:12,270
What did Joey say? I like you back?

210
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,942
You know... Well, see... He...

211
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:20,895
Joey knows that I'm very insecure
about my back.

212
00:13:21,178 --> 00:13:24,404
And you were hugging me...

213
00:13:24,692 --> 00:13:28,761
...so, obviously, you are not
repulsed by it. Yeah!

214
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:33,597
- Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
- No?

215
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:39,268
All right, here's the truth.

216
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:42,953
Joey said what he said...

217
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:46,497
...because I'm attracted to you.

218
00:13:48,003 --> 00:13:49,011
Wow.

219
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:50,641
Yeah, I admit it.

220
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,106
I have a crush on you. I know that's
crazy because we work together...

221
00:13:56,423 --> 00:13:58,012
...and nothing could ever happen.

222
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:00,698
The last thing I wanted to do
was freak you out...

223
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,898
...or make you feel uncomfortable.

224
00:14:04,182 --> 00:14:08,630
Which is why it would be really great
if you said something right about now.

225
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:12,420
Oh, my God.
Those guys are stealing my car.

226
00:14:12,636 --> 00:14:13,644
What?

227
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,283
Right there. That's my car!

228
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:18,820
- Hey!
- Okay, that's gonna take one minute.

229
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:21,610
Do you have anything else
you want to get off your chest?

230
00:14:21,855 --> 00:14:23,030
I can't believe this.

231
00:14:23,352 --> 00:14:27,100
We still have time to talk,
and they're not even in the car yet.

232
00:14:27,353 --> 00:14:29,262
Look, there they go.

233
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:33,677
Okay, Phoebe.
We should probably go back now.

234
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,567
Please, don't leave me.
I'll be lonely.

235
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:39,692
Stop it. Stop.

236
00:14:40,016 --> 00:14:43,657
- Okay, let's go. We can be strong.
- Yeah, okay.

237
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,618
Did you hear that?
She said, "Monica."

238
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:53,271
I can't leave her.

239
00:14:53,551 --> 00:14:56,576
We could sneak the dog back in,
and Chandler wouldn't even know.

240
00:14:56,786 --> 00:14:57,723
That's not gonna work.

241
00:14:58,038 --> 00:15:01,158
I had that dog for three days,
and Chandler had no idea.

242
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,799
He's not so smart.

243
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:05,622
Hey. I didn't know either.

244
00:15:05,902 --> 00:15:10,172
Yeah, but you kind of knew that
something was going on, didn't you?

245
00:15:10,738 --> 00:15:12,125
Yeah, I knew.

246
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:19,293
Where's Chandler?

247
00:15:20,723 --> 00:15:23,119
- Here I am.
- Wash your hands.

248
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,087
How did you know?

249
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,281
Hey, what's she doing back here?

250
00:15:33,596 --> 00:15:36,407
Relax, Ross.
She's not made of ice cream.

251
00:15:37,945 --> 00:15:41,528
Hey, look, Phoebe.
I laid out the states geographically.

252
00:15:41,772 --> 00:15:45,033
We don't have time for this.
We have to keep him away from my room.

253
00:15:45,286 --> 00:15:49,176
- Yeah, but, look what...
- This is what we do not have time for!

254
00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:57,105
- Where's Monica?
- In Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.

255
00:15:57,463 --> 00:15:58,567
Why not?

256
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,058
Monica's crying.

257
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:08,413
She's very upset
about this whole Klunkers thing.

258
00:16:08,631 --> 00:16:12,035
- Well, I should go in there.
- No, no.

259
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:15,474
No, she doesn't want to see
you right now.

260
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:19,652
- Why not?
- Because you sent away the dog.

261
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:23,162
- That's ridiculous.
- Oh, is it? Is it?!

262
00:16:25,088 --> 00:16:29,951
Look, when Monica and I were kids,
we had a dog named Rover.

263
00:16:30,271 --> 00:16:34,020
And one day, my dad decides
he doesn't like dogs.

264
00:16:34,272 --> 00:16:38,162
So Monica and her friend Phyllis...

265
00:16:39,422 --> 00:16:43,100
...take away the dog, and that was the
last time we ever saw him. See?

266
00:16:43,353 --> 00:16:46,129
This is just like that...

267
00:16:46,414 --> 00:16:50,269
...only with a few details changed.

268
00:16:53,756 --> 00:16:55,868
Okay, I'm in my sweatpants.

269
00:16:56,191 --> 00:16:57,400
Bring on the food.

270
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:05,956
- What's the matter?
- Monica's upset because of Klunkers.

271
00:17:06,211 --> 00:17:08,394
So? Bring the dog back.
You're a hero.

272
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:12,333
Yeah, I could be a hero.
I could do that.

273
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:14,759
What if it attacks me?

274
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:18,032
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.

275
00:17:20,197 --> 00:17:22,344
And that doesn't scare you?

276
00:17:27,469 --> 00:17:29,094
Ross, you need some help?

277
00:17:29,626 --> 00:17:30,979
From you?

278
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:33,929
Yes, please.

279
00:17:39,716 --> 00:17:41,827
First of all, Utah?

280
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,790
Dude, you can't just make stuff up.

281
00:17:48,588 --> 00:17:53,072
Okay, Klunkers,
come here, you big gerbil.

282
00:17:54,398 --> 00:17:55,406
Klunkers.

283
00:17:56,764 --> 00:17:58,745
Where's my Klunkers, my little...?

284
00:17:58,956 --> 00:18:03,227
No, no, no.
I am not going to do that voice.

285
00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:06,149
Klunkers.

286
00:18:11,446 --> 00:18:13,772
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

287
00:18:13,985 --> 00:18:17,663
Come back here,
you furry, little butt-sniffer.

288
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,279
Not you, ma'am.

289
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:24,561
I hate America!

290
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:28,317
When I finish this game,
I swear, I am moving.

291
00:18:30,616 --> 00:18:33,570
- Tag still talking to the police?
- Yeah.

292
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:36,319
Damn it. Why did I open my mouth?

293
00:18:36,635 --> 00:18:39,232
"I have a crush on you.
I'm attracted to you."

294
00:18:39,592 --> 00:18:41,609
I know that I freaked him out.

295
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,762
If you said it like that, you did.

296
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:46,578
What was I thinking?

297
00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:50,234
I work with this man.
I have to see him every day.

298
00:18:50,448 --> 00:18:51,657
How'd this happen to me?

299
00:18:51,874 --> 00:18:54,270
Oh, wait. That's right,
it was because of you.

300
00:18:57,093 --> 00:19:00,568
All right, I think I can help you.
You wanna know what you have to do?

301
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,512
- Please, help me.
- Okay, okay, okay.

302
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:06,477
Now, you're gonna want to talk
to him about this, right?

303
00:19:06,695 --> 00:19:10,135
But trust me, Rach,
that'll only make it worse.

304
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:13,752
You have to deny everything.

305
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:17,992
That conversation out there,
never happened.

306
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:21,580
Joey, I don't think that's gonna work.
It was a pretty long conversation.

307
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:24,225
There was no conversation.

308
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,091
Okay. Joey, I'm just gonna talk to Tag.

309
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:30,377
Who's "Tag"? There's no "Tag".

310
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:33,862
Okay. This conversation is over.

311
00:19:34,076 --> 00:19:36,436
See? It works.

312
00:19:37,764 --> 00:19:38,938
Hey, is Chandler here?

313
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,551
No, he went for a walk.

314
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,232
Okay, you cannot tell him,
but look who's back.

315
00:19:46,949 --> 00:19:48,265
Well, no, no, no.

316
00:19:48,724 --> 00:19:51,155
He went over to Ross' to bring
the dog back here.

317
00:19:51,437 --> 00:19:54,142
Oh, no, the dog's not going
to be there!

318
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:57,140
You think?

319
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:02,638
Hi, honey.

320
00:20:03,128 --> 00:20:05,903
Please, please, please,
don't be mad at me.

321
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:08,063
- What? Why would...?
- Wait and see.

322
00:20:08,311 --> 00:20:10,564
Maybe we will, maybe we won't.

323
00:20:11,755 --> 00:20:15,159
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment
to bring back Klunkers for you...

324
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:20,105
...and I left the door open,
and she must've gotten out.

325
00:20:20,697 --> 00:20:24,861
And I looked everywhere, all over
the apartment, including the roof.

326
00:20:25,185 --> 00:20:29,040
Which, FYI, Ross,
one of your neighbors, growing weed.

327
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:32,311
I couldn't find him...

328
00:20:32,596 --> 00:20:36,450
...and I am so, so, so sorry.

329
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:41,255
But I do know where we can all go
ease the pain.

330
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:46,017
We have good news. Look who's back!

331
00:20:48,043 --> 00:20:50,961
Klunkers. Oh, my God!

332
00:20:51,244 --> 00:20:55,871
- She came back all by herself.
- It's a Thanksgiving miracle.

333
00:20:57,785 --> 00:21:00,181
It is so good to see you.

334
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:02,481
She came all the way back
from Ross' building.

335
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:05,464
The things she must've seen.

336
00:21:06,274 --> 00:21:07,828
She climbed up the fire escape...

337
00:21:08,118 --> 00:21:12,744
...and she tapped on the window with her
teeny, little paw, and we ran to let her in.

338
00:21:14,868 --> 00:21:16,493
I went too far, didn't I?

339
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,422
When should I have stopped?

340
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:29,437
Okay, maybe this is so hard
because there aren't 50 states.

341
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:34,729
Let me tell you something.
I have 49 states...

342
00:21:34,978 --> 00:21:37,030
...and there are no more!

343
00:21:38,352 --> 00:21:41,306
I think I should be able
to eat something.

344
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:43,501
It's up to you.

345
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:51,115
- Oh, hi. How are you doing?
- I'm okay.

346
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:54,353
I gotta go down to the police station
and look at mug shots.

347
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,738
Thanks for having me over.

348
00:21:56,061 --> 00:21:58,208
Tag, you're going?

349
00:21:58,949 --> 00:22:01,309
We didn't even get a chance to talk.

350
00:22:01,627 --> 00:22:03,988
So where did you say
you're from again?

351
00:22:04,203 --> 00:22:06,634
- Colorado.
- What good are you?

352
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,789
Look, I think we should talk
about what happened on the terrace.

353
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,286
Okay.

354
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:20,409
I never should've said what I said.

355
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:22,948
It just doesn't matter how I feel.

356
00:22:23,268 --> 00:22:26,743
We work together, so nothing could
really ever happen between us.

357
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:31,853
I would love to go to work on Monday
and never talk about this again.

358
00:22:32,174 --> 00:22:36,029
Okay. Big day, Monday.
Lots to do.

359
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:37,665
So we okay?

360
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:40,027
I'm not.

361
00:22:40,281 --> 00:22:41,491
I knew it.
I freaked you out.

362
00:22:41,812 --> 00:22:43,544
No, you didn't.

363
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:48,003
What freaked me out was you saying
nothing could happen between us.

364
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:51,337
- Really?
- Yeah.

365
00:22:52,006 --> 00:22:54,675
So please don't fire me
for doing this.

366
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:07,965
That's one less thing
we have to do on Monday.

367
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,177
Delaware.

368
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:36,398
Delaware.

369
00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:40,156
- All right.
- I want my turkey now.

370
00:23:40,715 --> 00:23:42,244
You got it.

371
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:49,540
You got Nevada twice.

372
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,039
- I know.
- Yeah.
