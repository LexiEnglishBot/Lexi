1
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:06,964
- Hey.
- Hey, check it out. This is unbelievable.

2
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,342
Joey has been holding his breath
for almost four minutes.

3
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,766
Are you trying to kill me?

4
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,395
- Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.
- Uh-huh, what?

5
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:26,233
Um, well, since I'm moving out
and you're so beautiful...

6
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,735
...how about I move in with you?

7
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:31,155
Well, that would be great,
but then what do we do about Denise?

8
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,408
- Who's Denise?
- My roommate.

9
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,786
- You have a roommate?
- Yes, Denise. Denise.

10
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,707
Hey, what is with the secrecy, Phoebe?
Huh?

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,126
And what about this Denise? She cute?

12
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,130
How can you have a roommate
that none of us know about?

13
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,591
Maybe because you never listen
to anything I say.

14
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,926
I talk about her all the time. Denise!

15
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:58,474
Rach, I was thinking, I'm gonna have
an extra room over at my place.

16
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,893
- Oh, that's true.
- Why don't you move in with me?

17
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,979
It'll be great.
We can stay up late talking, watch movies.

18
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,565
And you know
about naked Thursdays, right?

19
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,862
Yeah, yeah,
I think I'm gonna find my own place.

20
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,741
Hey, hey. I thought naked Thursdays
was just our thing, man.

21
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,701
- Hey.
- Hey.

22
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:03,038
What did Rachel say when you told her
you were still married to her?

23
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,291
Oh, that. Um, she took it really well.

24
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,586
- Oh. You didn't tell her, did you?
- No.

25
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:13,507
- Because you're in love with her.
- I am not in love with her.

26
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,843
She was very upset
about having to move out.

27
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,638
So I didn't tell her we were still married,
because she'd only get more upset.

28
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,015
I comforted her. As a friend.

29
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:25,435
- What do you mean, "comforted her"?
- It was nothing. I gave her a hug.

30
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,397
Aha. A classic sign of love, the hug.

31
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,191
It's also a sign of friendship.

32
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,277
Yeah, not in your case, Lovey Loverson.

33
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,113
It was a hug.

34
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,116
Just tell me this,
did you or did you not smell her hair?

35
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:43,620
Smell her hair? Well, what if I did?

36
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:47,541
Ninety percent of a woman's pheromones
come out the top of her head.

37
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,210
That's why women are shorter.

38
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:54,047
So that men will fall in love
when they hug them.

39
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,426
Come on, Ross, you're a scientist.

40
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,220
I was hugging her as a friend, okay?

41
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,639
It's not my fault her hair got in my face.

42
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:06,226
She's got a lot of it,
and it smells all, uh...

43
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,645
...you know, coconutty.

44
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,901
What? Oh. It doesn't mean
I have feelings for Rachel.

45
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,612
Maybe it means I have feelings
for coconuts.

46
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,783
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful.
Rachel's not in the same place you are.

47
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,786
Okay, if the place you're referring to
is being in love...

48
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:30,500
...then she is in the same place as me,
because I am not in that place.

49
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,836
Okay, I didn't understand that.

50
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:38,008
But maybe that's because you were
speaking the secret language of love.

51
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,639
- Hey.
- Hey.

52
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,141
- Dude, some guy just called for you.
- Who was it?

53
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,392
I don't know.

54
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,270
How about
"Thanks for taking the message"? Jeez.

55
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,148
Hey, listen.

56
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,567
When you move in,
Rachel's room's gonna be empty.

57
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,861
You wanna talk
about what we wanna do with it?

58
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,071
- Sure.
- Okay.

59
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,406
I think we should have
a beautiful guest room...

60
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:05,327
...with a mahogany sleigh bed
and bedside tables with flowers on them.

61
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,038
Then we could have a rolltop desk
with comment cards...

62
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,541
...so people can tell us
how much they love staying here.

63
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,420
Whatever, you know,
I really haven't thought about it that much.

64
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,882
Well, I like that idea, obviously. Ha, ha.

65
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,552
But I was thinking maybe
it could be a game room, you know?

66
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,554
I mean, you can buy old arcade games...

67
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,891
...like "Space Invaders"
and "Asteroids" for $200.

68
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,269
The real ones. The big, big, big ones.

69
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,730
No.

70
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,610
Okay, so you mean "no" as in,
"Gee, Chandler, what an interesting idea.

71
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,655
Let's discuss it
before we reject it completely."

72
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,991
Oh. I'm sorry. Of course.

73
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,745
Yes. Interesting idea,
um, talk about it, but no.

74
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,581
So that's it?

75
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:55,419
Well, I just don't think that arcade games
go in the beautiful guest room.

76
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,963
The guest room's gonna be filled
with antiques.

77
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,675
Which is why "Asteroids" is perfect.
It's the oldest game.

78
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,429
What do you have
against the guest room?

79
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,639
I don't have anything
against the guest room.

80
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,518
Especially since everybody that we know
lives about 30 seconds away.

81
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,062
Are you mocking me?

82
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,690
No, I'm not mocking you
or your beautiful guest room.

83
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,905
What's up?

84
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,199
Nothing. Monica and I had a stupid fight.

85
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,786
But you're still moving in together, right?
Because my ad came out today.

86
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,291
"Wanted: Female roommate,
nonsmoker, nonugly."

87
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,712
- Nice.
- Ah?

88
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,505
I figured after living with you...

89
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,508
...it'd be an interesting change
to have a female roommate.

90
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:47,304
You know? Someone I could learn from.
Someone who's different than me.

91
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:51,141
And what's more different than me,
a guy who's not 19...

92
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,810
...than, say, a girl who is 19?

93
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,520
Ah? Ha, ha.

94
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,814
Not just a hat rack, my friend.

95
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:04,071
- Pheebs, I have to ask you...
- Shh. I'm swamped right now.

96
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,199
You're just staring into space.

97
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,744
Um, I'm trying to move that pencil.

98
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,747
- This one?
- It worked!

99
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:18,835
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing
is a nightmare.

100
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:22,089
Every place that I can afford
comes with a roommate who is a freak.

101
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,882
Look at this.

102
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,428
"Wanted: Female roommate,
nonsmoker, nonugly."

103
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:35,018
- It's just there's nothing. This city is full.
- Wait, no, look at this.

104
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,521
"Two-bedroom, two-bath.
Must be nonsmoker.

105
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,399
Satan worshipers okay."

106
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,693
Oh. Yeah, but it's on the ground floor.

107
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,114
- Hey.
- Hey.

108
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,283
- Rach, are you still looking for a place?
- Yeah, why?

109
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,661
Okay, there's this guy Warren
from the museum...

110
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,205
...and he's going on a dig
for like two years.

111
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,041
And he's got this great place
he needs to sublet.

112
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,918
So you interested?

113
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,505
That sounds great.
I'd love to live at Warren's. I love Warren.

114
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,882
- Thank you.
- Oh, don't thank me.

115
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,093
You wanna thank someone,
thank the volcano...

116
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,178
...that erupted thousands of years ago...

117
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,890
...killing but perfectly preserving
an entire civilization.

118
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,060
Here's Warren's number.

119
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,689
Oh, this is great.
I am gonna call him right now.

120
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,066
- Oh, okay. Oh.
- Thank you. Ha, ha.

121
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,988
Okay, you go call him.

122
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,240
I saw it.

123
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,202
I don't know what you're talking about.

124
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,205
I'm talking about that which you already
know but won't admit.

125
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,958
You know, that you love her again.
You relove her.

126
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,961
Look, I do not relove her.

127
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,047
I can't believe you won't just admit it.

128
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,593
Okay, just promise me
that you won't do anything stupid.

129
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,638
Look, we're just friends now, okay?
Why would I do anything stupid?

130
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,017
Ugh. Well, the apartment
is already subletted.

131
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,103
I mean, this is just hopeless.
I'm never gonna find anything.

132
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:01,980
You can live with me.

133
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,273
- What?
- What?

134
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,610
What?

135
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,658
- Oh, my God, are you serious?
- Uh-huh.

136
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,413
I would love to live with you, Ross.
That's great. Thank you.

137
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,957
I'm just glad I could,
you know, help you out.

138
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:27,380
Wow, I'm so happy for you guys.
This is so, so not stupid.

139
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,594
Ross, Ross, you have no idea
what this means to me.

140
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:37,057
I mean, I was gonna be homeless.
You've just saved me. You're my hero.

141
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,019
Hero? I don't know. Well, all right.

142
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,732
Oh. I have to go tell Monica
what a wonderful brother she has.

143
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,152
- Aw. Mwah.
- Oh, please.

144
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,495
You're gonna say things now, aren't you?

145
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,498
No. No, I won't.

146
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,625
But I should tell you this.

147
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,586
This exact same thing happened
to my roommate, Denise.

148
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:07,963
She moved in with a guy...

149
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,758
...who was secretly married to her
and said he didn't love her but really did.

150
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:12,968
It just blew up.

151
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,971
And that's how she ended up
living with me.

152
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,684
Okay, that's a lie.

153
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,939
- Hi.
- Hi.

154
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,442
Hi. Listen, I'm sorry about before.
I don't need to have a game room.

155
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,988
When I was a kid, I only played
those games because I couldn't get girls.

156
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,115
Now I can get...

157
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:36,908
Now I have you.

158
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,704
No, not that I think that I have you...

159
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:44,165
...or think of you as property
in any sort of way.

160
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,251
- I see women...
- Stop it, Chandler.

161
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,629
I'm sorry too.

162
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,091
- Really?
- Yeah. Oh, yes.

163
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,801
Oh.

164
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,803
Listen, we don't have to make that
a guest room.

165
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,347
- We can think of something together.
- That's a great idea.

166
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,475
We can easily think of a way
for us both to enjoy the room.

167
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,561
Totally.

168
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,485
- We don't have to come up with this now.
- Oh, good.

169
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:16,197
Why don't we think about changes
that we can make in the living room?

170
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,907
Changes?

171
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:21,244
Yeah, I mean, we're gonna have to move
some furniture to make room for my chair.

172
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,333
You're gonna bring the Barcalounger
over here?

173
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,502
- Is that a problem?
- Well...

174
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,173
It's just that they're a set
and they should probably stay together.

175
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,259
Oh, that's cool.
Then I'll just bring them both over.

176
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,971
See, now you're taking them away
from their home.

177
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,975
Okay, I get it. So I get nothing.
Nothing here is mine. Everything is yours.

178
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,729
I'll get up in the morning,
put on your clothes, and head off to work.

179
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,065
Yeah. Yeah, you know what?
That's it. That's it.

180
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,609
Everything will be mine.
Nothing will be yours.

181
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,986
Oh, come on.
I'm talking about the Barcalounger.

182
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,405
It doesn't match. Where is it gonna go?

183
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,282
In the game room.

184
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,827
Look, it is not my fault
that your chairs are incredibly ugly.

185
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,956
That's fine. I won't bring over the chairs.
I won't bring anything over.

186
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,835
I wouldn't wanna ruin the ambiance
over here at Grandma's place!

187
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,173
Everything on your application
looks really good.

188
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,133
Oh, just one last question.

189
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,595
Are you and your friends
gonna be over here all the time partying?

190
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,722
Oh, don't worry.
I'm not really a party girl.

191
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,557
Whoa.

192
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,520
Now, don't just be blurting stuff out.

193
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,023
I want you to really think
about your answers.

194
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,861
You can call off the roommate search.
Hi. I'll be living here.

195
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,154
Oh, don't listen to him.

196
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,281
He's just some guy
who wants the apartment.

197
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,784
But I don't think he's gonna get it.

198
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,829
Why did you take
the shower curtain down?

199
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,455
That thing was a hazard.

200
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,250
I'm very safety-conscious.

201
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,760
- Hey.
- Hey.

202
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,304
Oh, I was just clearing some space
for your stuff.

203
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,556
Oh, thanks.

204
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,433
But listen, I was just at Monica's...

205
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,686
...and she and Chandler had a big fight
and they're not moving in.

206
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:14,315
What do you mean, not moving in?
They're still moving in, right?

207
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:18,653
No, no, they just had a big blowout
over what to do with my room.

208
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,489
What? Over a stupid room?

209
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,032
I feel kind of bad for them...

210
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,119
...but I'm also psyched
because I don't have to move in here.

211
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,913
Oh, no. Yeah. No, that part's great.

212
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,669
What's all this about you guys fighting?

213
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,130
Is this really over a room?

214
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,966
I mean, that is so silly.

215
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,637
- Ross, we can handle this.
- Well, apparently not.

216
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:49,726
And I can't just stand by and watch
two people I care about so much...

217
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,271
...be hurt by something that is so silly.

218
00:12:55,691 --> 00:13:00,361
- I mean, enough of the silliness.
- Why don't you tell her to stop being silly?

219
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,741
Okay, okay.

220
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,995
Two very good points.

221
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:13,249
Look, I've known you both a long time.

222
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,920
And I've never seen either of you
one-millionth as happy...

223
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,464
...as you've been since you got together.

224
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:24,385
Do you really wanna throw that all away
over a room?

225
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,846
That is so silly.

226
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,642
What's more important, love...

227
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,310
...or silliness?

228
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,815
Well, we are fond of the silliness.

229
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,400
But we also have a soft spot for the love.

230
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,821
- Love is the best medicine.
- That's laughter.

231
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,906
- Why do you do it?
- I don't know.

232
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:53,873
Now, Chandler,
you wanna live with Monica, right?

233
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,543
Yeah, I do.

234
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,045
And, Mon, you wanna live with Chandler,
don't you?

235
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,380
Yes.

236
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:04,217
Good. A verbal contract is binding
in the state of New York.

237
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,729
So I understand
you're looking for a place?

238
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,359
- No, no, I'm staying put.
- Oh.

239
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,489
I was going to offer you my apartment.

240
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,242
Why? Where are you going?

241
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,786
I don't know.

242
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,916
- Hey, Rach.
- Hi.

243
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,378
Uh, you're never gonna believe it.
Monica and Chandler are moving in again.

244
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:44,007
That's great news, right?
I mean, for them, right?

245
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,884
Oh, wow.

246
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,178
But on the bright side,
we get to be roommates again.

247
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,558
Yeah. You know, about that, um...

248
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:59,314
Ross, ahem, I really appreciate your offer
to let me move in and everything...

249
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,441
...but don't you think
it's gonna be weird?

250
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:07,322
Why? Why? Why would it...?
Why would it be weird?

251
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,408
Well, you know, because of us.

252
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,493
Because of our history.

253
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,871
- No.
- No?

254
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,081
No, no.

255
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,501
It would only be weird
if we were still in that place.

256
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:24,339
I mean, are you still in that place?

257
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,759
- No, not at all.
- Good. Me neither.

258
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,552
So it's not a problem.

259
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,097
We're just two friends
who happen to be roommates.

260
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,601
Okay, but, Ross,
eventually, you and I are gonna be dating.

261
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,689
Really? We are?

262
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,276
Well, yeah. I'm gonna have a boyfriend
and you're gonna have a girlfriend.

263
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,862
Oh. Heh.

264
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,698
That'd be great.

265
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:54,285
But if you think it's gonna be okay,
we'll just work out a system.

266
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,956
It'll be like in college. I'll hang a hanger
on the door and put a sign:

267
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,166
"Come back later. I'm getting lucky."

268
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,300
Yeah, I didn't think of that.

269
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:15,223
So are you sure
about this whole moving-in thing?

270
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:20,311
I mean, it's a really big step.
And what's the rush?

271
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,358
That's very funny.

272
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,319
He's being silly
because he knows we enjoy the silliness.

273
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,574
No, I'm serious, okay?
I mean, think about it.

274
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:38,162
You move in, you start fighting
over stupid game rooms...

275
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,081
...next thing you know, you break up.

276
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,459
Ross, you were right before.
It was just a stupid fight about a room.

277
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,211
Okay, there are no stupid fights.

278
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,798
This isn't about the room.

279
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:52,510
This is about what the room represents.

280
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,889
And unfortunately,
this room could destroy you.

281
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,727
- Yeah, I'm not so worried.
- Yeah, no, me neither.

282
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,396
Fine. It's your life.

283
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,940
I just don't wanna see you break up.

284
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:10,028
Which you will do
if you move in together.

285
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,491
But if that's what you want,
there's nothing I can do.

286
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,660
Don't do it!

287
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,043
- You still wanna move in together, right?
- Of course.

288
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,627
Ross didn't scare you?

289
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,380
Scared me out of ever wanting
to live with him.

290
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,593
- Come here, I gotta show you something.
- Okay.

291
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,181
Oh, my God,
someone's killed Square Man.

292
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,977
This is where the Barcalounger could go.

293
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,731
You see, you can see the TV, and still,
it's walking distance to the kitchen.

294
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,692
Oh, that's so sweet.

295
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,235
I wanna show you something.

296
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,822
You know those big road signs
that say "merge"?

297
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,407
Mm-hm.

298
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,993
You know? So I was thinking
we could get one of those signs...

299
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,287
...and hang it over our bed.

300
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,083
Because that's you and I together.

301
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,417
"Merge."

302
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,254
- Oh, my God, I love that.
- Really?

303
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,173
"No."

304
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,346
I found you in my bed

305
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,182
How'd you wind up there?

306
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,352
You are a mystery

307
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,982
Little black curly hair

308
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,152
Little black, little black
Little black, little black

309
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,241
Little black curly hair

310
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,285
Thank you.

311
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,663
Um...

312
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,541
If you wanna receive e-mails
about my upcoming shows...

313
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:50,253
...then please give me money
so I can buy a computer.

314
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,466
So, uh... Ahem.

315
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,552
Where are the other guys?

316
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,179
Well, let's see,
Monica and Chandler are occupied.

317
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,931
- Fighting?
- No, the other thing.

318
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,060
I really think it's great
they worked things out.

319
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,063
Yeah, there's no breaking them up,
is there?

320
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:13,067
Hey, can I borrow the key to your house
so I can make a copy?

321
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,736
- Here.
- Thank you.

322
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:16,946
Now, are you sure?

323
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,241
Because once I make a copy,
there's no turning back.

324
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,076
Yeah, I'm sure.

325
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,955
Now get out of here
before I change my mind.

326
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,086
Uh, listen, Ross.

327
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,173
You really think this moving in with Rachel
is a good idea?

328
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,800
I've been back and forth.

329
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,179
Yeah, well,
maybe you should go back, okay?

330
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,306
Rachel moves in,
and before you know it...

331
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,850
...you're where you don't wanna be,
back together.

332
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,518
Yeah, I don't think so.

333
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,354
She's already talking about,
you know, dating other guys.

334
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,856
That's not gonna work out.

335
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,401
Then she's gonna come home all weepy,
and you'll be telling her:

336
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,612
"Oh, that's okay. You'll find someone."

337
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,990
And then, bam, she finds you.

338
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,536
Huh. Oh, maybe you're right.

339
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,207
I am telling you, Ross, she is definitely
gonna fall in love with you again.

340
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,666
Now, is that what you want?

341
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,420
- Heh. Is that what I want?
- Yes.

342
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,884
Here she comes.
I'm gonna make your life much easier.

343
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,012
All right, well, the place was closed,
so I'll copy it later.

344
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,388
Or not.

345
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,141
Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in
with me?

346
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,684
- Ahh.
- Oh.

347
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:32,021
- Whoa, whoa, Joey.
- No, no, no. It's okay.

348
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:37,526
Look, Rach, I know I scared you off
with that whole naked-Thursdays thing...

349
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,947
...but we don't have to do that.

350
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:45,117
Well, it would be easier
to move just right across the hall.

351
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,830
Wait a minute, unless you're thinking
about naked Wednesdays.

352
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,584
Thursday's clearly not good for you.
Pick a day.

353
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,758
- Hi.
- Hi.

354
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,511
Come on in. Thanks for coming back.

355
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,305
Okay, there have been a lot of people
interested in the room.

356
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,308
But I have narrowed it down,
and you are one of the finalists.

357
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,978
- Great.
- Okay, now, before I make my decision...

358
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,356
...I just wanna make sure
that our personalities match, okay?

359
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,816
So I made up a little test.

360
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:21,070
Now, I'm gonna say a word, and then
you say the first thing that comes to mind.

361
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,948
- I can do that.
- Okay, here we go.

362
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,533
- Pillow.
- Fight.

363
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,535
Very good.

364
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,663
Okay. G.

365
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,999
- String?
- Excellent.

366
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,585
Okay. Um...

367
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,838
Doggy.

368
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,259
- Kitten?
- Ooh, sorry.

369
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,139
No, no, no. So close, though.
But, you know, okay, bye-bye.
