1
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:04,545
Okay, great. Bye.

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,464
So guess who's coming
to Thanksgiving dinner.

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,341
Sidney Poitier? Ha, ha.

4
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:12,052
I miss Rachel.

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,762
No, my parents.

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,390
Oh, great, they haven't seen the place
since I moved in.

7
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:19,977
Yeah, and if you could not mention
that we live together, that'd be great.

8
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,479
I was thinking we'd eat around 4.

9
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,982
Why can't I tell them
we live together?

10
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,110
They don't know we're dating.
Should we eat in the kitchen?

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,195
Why haven't you told them?

12
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,157
Um, well, I was going to. I really was.

13
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,577
But, um, then somewhere,
just out of nowhere, I didn't.

14
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,997
Why haven't you told them?
Wouldn't they be happy?

15
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:43,542
So, dinner in the kitchen around 4.
I'll see you then.

16
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,294
Why wouldn't they be happy?

17
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,087
Well, um, because...

18
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,173
...mainly, um...

19
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,301
...they don't like you.

20
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,970
- I'm sorry.
- What? Why? Why?

21
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,639
Maybe because you used to be aloof...

22
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,893
...or that you're really sarcastic
or that you joke around all the time...

23
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,896
...or that you take off your clothes
and throw them on the couch.

24
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,607
Is this why they don't like me
or why you don't like me?

25
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:11,320
I know I should have told them.
I know I shouldn't care what they think.

26
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,488
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:17,785
You know, it'll be okay, because
when they come over, I will be charming.

28
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,621
I will make them love me,
then we'll tell them.

29
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,914
You think that'll work?

30
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,542
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe.
I won you over, didn't I?

31
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,421
I don't think you'll ever get
my parents that drunk.

32
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,340
Hey. Oh, good, Ross.
Your parents like me, right?

33
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,509
Yes, of course they like you.

34
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,219
Monica told me they don't.

35
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,096
Yeah, they don't like you.

36
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,390
Do you know why?

37
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:25,644
Maybe it's because you're really sarcastic,
or maybe it's because you...

38
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,647
If people don't know,
they shouldn't just guess.

39
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,442
Great. Another Thanksgiving
with nothing to give thanks for.

40
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,529
Maybe I give thanks
for you shutting up, huh?

41
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,950
Maybe I give thanks by taking
my PlayStation to my new apartment.

42
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,994
Maybe I love you.

43
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,705
- Hi.
- Hi.

44
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,373
Hey, guys.

45
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,127
No, I don't want
to play video games, Joey.

46
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,174
Are you guys going
to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?

47
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,425
Yeah, why, what's up?

48
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,136
Well, me and my dancer friends
are doing Thanksgiving uptown.

49
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,138
I thought you might like to come.

50
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,056
For real?

51
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,852
You should go to Chandler's.
None of us can cook.

52
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,520
We'll probably just drink all day.

53
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,564
- We go to yours.
- Yeah.

54
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:16,111
Yeah, see, we have to stop across the hall
because it's my sister.

55
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,573
But, you know, actually, uh,
growing up with a sister was nice...

56
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:22,075
...because it really helped me
understand women.

57
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,953
Yeah, you should tell your friends that.

58
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,247
Okay.

59
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,380
How you got three women to marry you,
I'll never know.

60
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,678
- Hey.
- Hey.

61
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,056
Pheebs, check it out.
For my dessert...

62
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,850
...I have chosen to make
a traditional English trifle.

63
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,812
Wow, that sounds great.
And what are you making, Monica?

64
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:54,274
In case Rachel's dessert
is so good that I eat all of it...

65
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,737
...and there's none left
for anybody else.

66
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,989
Nothing.

67
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,532
Nothing?

68
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,118
No, sweetie. I trust you.

69
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,705
So if I mess this up,
there's nothing else for dessert?

70
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,166
You're not gonna mess it up.

71
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:15,212
Wow, Monica, I love that.
You really have faith in me. Thank you.

72
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,382
Technical question: How do you know
when the butter is done?

73
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,885
Well, it's done about two minutes
before it looks like that.

74
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,764
- Hey.
- Hey.

75
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:30,435
- Oh. The food smells great, Mon.
- And the place looks so nice.

76
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,022
- Hey, happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

77
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,108
Happy Thanksgiving.

78
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:39,027
- Well, this has been great.
- See you.

79
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,279
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

80
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,365
- Where you going?
- Oh, oh.

81
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:47,661
We did say we'd stop by this little
thing Joey's roommate is having.

82
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,289
Oh, Janine,
the really hot dancer girl?

83
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:54,209
Some would say she's attractive, yes.

84
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,503
Who else is going to be there?

85
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,047
- Uh, some of her friends.
- Her dancer friends?

86
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,882
Yes. All right?

87
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,344
All of her hot dancer friends
are gonna be there...

88
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,973
...and they'll be drinking and dancing
and we really want to go.

89
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,394
Dude, we were good.

90
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,523
You're not going. You said
you'd eat here and you'll eat here.

91
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,693
Yeah, and leaving us
to go see hot dancer girls...

92
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,862
...is not very Thanksgiving-y.

93
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,155
Oh, but it is.

94
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:28,243
Uh, it's like the first Thanksgiving
when the Indians and Pilgrims sat down.

95
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,912
Yeah, and then the Indians
taught the Pilgrims...

96
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,498
...what it meant to be hot
in the New World.

97
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,044
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi.

98
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,173
Hi, Dad. Mom.

99
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,468
Look. Look who it is.
It's Chandler.

100
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,513
Oh, yes, of course.
Hello, Chandler.

101
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,183
Mr. And Mrs. Geller,
you look wonderful.

102
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,353
It is great to have you here.
Let us take your coats.

103
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,189
Whoa, it snowing out there?

104
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,274
No.

105
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,658
Monica, all this food looks wonderful.

106
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,744
You should think about doing this
for a living.

107
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:18,251
Okay, I have dandruff.
There's no need to laugh and point.

108
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,005
Dad, Chandler was laughing at your joke.

109
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,840
My joke wasn't funny.

110
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,470
Rach, I just remembered.

111
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,806
I had a dream
about Mr. Geller last night.

112
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,099
Really?

113
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,976
Yeah. I dreamt that he saved me
from a burning building...

114
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,229
...and he was so brave and so strong.

115
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,565
And it's making me look at him
totally differently.

116
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,987
You know, I mean, he used to be just
"Jack Geller, Monica and Ross' dad."

117
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,533
Now he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."

118
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,831
I don't know.
To me, he'll always be "Jack Geller...

119
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,291
...walks in while you're changing."

120
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,173
You know, Dad, Chandler is one
of Ross' very best friends.

121
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,175
Ross sure is a great guy.

122
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,761
You know, I've always felt that
how a young man turns out...

123
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,431
...is a reflection on his father.

124
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,309
I always thought that too.
Tell me, what does your father do?

125
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,022
He's a headliner of a...

126
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,108
...gay burlesque show.

127
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,447
Rach, you're killing us.
Will you serve the dessert already?

128
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,241
There's drunken dancers a-waiting.

129
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,577
Look at it. Isn't it beautiful?

130
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,120
Yeah. What is it?

131
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,622
It's a trifle.
It's got all these layers.

132
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,042
First there's a layer of ladyfingers,
then a layer of jam...

133
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:45,172
...then custard,
which I made from scratch...

134
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,215
...then raspberries,
more ladyfingers...

135
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,634
...then beef sautéed
with peas and onions...

136
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,512
...then a little bit more custard...

137
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,183
...then bananas and then
I put whipped cream on top.

138
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,273
What was the one right before bananas?

139
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,778
The beef.
Yeah, that was weird to me too.

140
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,240
But then I thought,
"Well, there's minced meat pie."

141
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,034
That's an English dessert.

142
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,537
These people just put
very strange things in their food.

143
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,623
By the way,
can I borrow rum from your place?

144
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:20,999
Yeah, sure.

145
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,376
And while I'm gone,
don't you boys sneak a taste.

146
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,462
- Okay.
- Okay.

147
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,467
Beef in a dessert?

148
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,969
No, no, no. There is no way.

149
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,306
I know. And only one layer of jam?

150
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,895
What is up with that?

151
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,856
Oh, my God.

152
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,109
- The pages are stuck together.
- Chandler.

153
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:59,663
Oh, my God. She made
half an English trifle and...

154
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,708
...half a shepherd's pie.

155
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,212
Man, now she's gonna start all over.

156
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:11,132
We're never gonna get to introduce
the hot girls to the New World.

157
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,678
No, no, we will.
We just won't tell her she messed up.

158
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,888
Just let her serve
the beef-custard thing?

159
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,017
Yeah. It'll be like
a funny Thanksgiving story.

160
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,062
Vomiting stories are funny, I guess.

161
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,316
Joey. God, your apartment
is like a hundred degrees.

162
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,152
Did it make you want
to walk around in your underwear?

163
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,029
No.

164
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,949
Still not hot enough.

165
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,246
Rachel. Okay, look at him.

166
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,790
Look at those strong hands.

167
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,836
Oh, what I wouldn't give
to be that can of condensed milk.

168
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,385
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying
how beautiful your sweater is.

169
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,304
Oh, thank you, Chandler. I just bought it.

170
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:02,100
Oh. Yes, well, it's very beautiful
and it's cream-colored and tight and...

171
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:08,273
I don't mean tight. It's not too tight.
Not that I was looking at...

172
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,234
What's the matter with him?

173
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,820
I think he's stoned again.

174
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,281
- What?
- What?

175
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,991
Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.

176
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,334
Okay, I think I might know
why my parents don't like you.

177
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:31,212
- You do? Why?
- Okay, remember we were young. Heh.

178
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,300
Spring break, sophomore year,
I got high in my bedroom...

179
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,719
...and my parents walked in
and smelled it...

180
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,098
...so I told them that you had gotten stoned
and jumped out the window.

181
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,934
What? Why did you do that?

182
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,980
I don't know. Uh, yours was the first
name that popped into my head.

183
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,232
I'm sorry. I didn't think it'd matter.

184
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,484
How could it not matter?

185
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,236
How was I to know
we'd be friends after college...

186
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,489
...let alone
you'd be living with my sister?

187
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,532
What about all that
"friends forever" stuff?

188
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,452
I don't know. I was all high.

189
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:13,505
Mom and Dad just sent me to find out
if you were trying to get Ross stoned.

190
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:19,761
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot
in college, and he blamed it on me.

191
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,388
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that.

192
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:26,142
We haven't told them we're together
because they hate me, okay? So fix this.

193
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:30,355
Okay, okay, I'll tell them
it wasn't Chandler who got high.

194
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,066
Now, who should I say it was?

195
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:38,530
You. It's not like it's a big deal.
You don't still do it or anything.

196
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:43,076
All right. Now, who should I say
tricked me into doing it?

197
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,374
Dad.

198
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,210
Dad, please don't pick
your teeth out here.

199
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,089
- And if you're gonna put your feet up...
- Monica, leave him alone.

200
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,759
Will you hurry up?

201
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,763
Did you not hear me when I told you
that all of Janine's friends are dancers?

202
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:07,058
Huh? And that they're gonna
be drinking a lot?

203
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:11,688
No, I did. But tell me again
because it's so romantic.

204
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,482
You're whipping so slow.
Can't you do it any faster?

205
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,860
Joey, come on,
I don't want to make any mistakes.

206
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,988
This is the only dessert. If I screw it up,
everybody's gonna be like:

207
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:24,367
"Oh, remember that Thanksgiving
when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"

208
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,206
So just let me worry about making it,
and you just worry about eating it.

209
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,875
Oh, I am.

210
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:37,505
- Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will.
- Okay. Fine.

211
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,134
- Ross, can I talk to you for a second?
- Oh, uh...

212
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,887
Can it wait a second, Joey?
I have to tell my parents something.

213
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,638
No, it can't? Okay.

214
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,897
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel
she messed up her dessert.

215
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,316
What? What is with everybody?

216
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,193
It's Thanksgiving, not...

217
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,445
...Truth Day.

218
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:04,783
Look, when everyone eats
that banana-meat thing...

219
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,577
...they'll all make fun of her.
Do you want that?

220
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,206
Okay. We'll just get everyone
to act like they like it.

221
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,416
That way, no one makes fun of her...

222
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,920
...and we still get to go
to sweet potato pie.

223
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,964
Dude, they're not objects.

224
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,883
Oh.

225
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,636
Just kidding. I'll talk to them.
You distract her.

226
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,641
Hey, Rach, can I talk to you
outside for a sec?

227
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,769
Okay.

228
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,902
What's up, Ross?

229
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,821
So, um...

230
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,698
Thanksgiving.

231
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:51,037
The holiday season is upon us, hmm?

232
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,581
Yeah.

233
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,708
And, um...

234
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,087
...you look nice today.

235
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,674
- Oh, no. No, Ross, don't do this.
- What?

236
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:07,220
I just don't think us getting back together
is a good idea.

237
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,764
Huh?

238
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,684
I thought this might happen today.

239
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,103
Ross, I know the holidays can be rough...

240
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,481
...and it's probably really hard
for you to be alone right now.

241
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,816
You're alone.

242
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,027
No, I live with Phoebe.

243
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,197
I mean, you're alone-alone.

244
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:31,160
And it's just not the time for us.
I'm sorry.

245
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,706
Oh, well.
Can't blame a guy for trying.

246
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,921
And, uh, if anyone needs help
pretending to like it...

247
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:46,175
...I learned some things in acting class.
Try, uh, rubbing your stomach.

248
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,346
Or, uh, saying "Mm."

249
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,849
And, uh, oh, smiling.

250
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,225
Okay?

251
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,854
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay
for those acting classes anymore.

252
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,067
Rachel, there you are.
Let's serve that dessert already.

253
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:07,447
Joey, you have to stop rushing me.
You know what? You don't get any dessert.

254
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,740
Really?

255
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,286
No, just kidding.
I would never do that to you.

256
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,331
Okay, everybody, it's trifle time.

257
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,209
So, now, Rach, this is a traditional
English trifle, isn't it?

258
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,711
- It sure is.
- Wow.

259
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,047
So did you make it
with beef or eggplant?

260
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,926
- Beef.
- I can't have any. I don't eat meat. Oh.

261
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,969
Aw.

262
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,641
Monica, I want you
to have the first taste.

263
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,476
Really?

264
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,648
Wait, you only got whipped cream.

265
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,067
You gotta take a bite
with all the layers.

266
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,904
Okay.

267
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,697
You dropped a pea.

268
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,625
Well?

269
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,294
Mm.

270
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,761
It's good.

271
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,888
Really? How good?

272
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,099
It's so good that I feel really selfish...

273
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,559
...about being the only one
who's eating it.

274
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,313
I think we should have everyone
taste how good it is.

275
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,607
Especially Ross.

276
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:28,987
Mm-hm.

277
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,197
Mm.

278
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:35,076
Yeah. This is so good that I'm gonna
go enjoy it on the balcony.

279
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:41,207
So that I can enjoy the view
whilst I enjoy my dessert.

280
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,460
I've gotta call my friend...

281
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,338
...and tell her how good
this is from Monica's room.

282
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,840
I'll help you dial.

283
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,428
I'm gonna go into the bathroom...

284
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,639
...so I can look at it
in the mirror as I eat it.

285
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,561
Okay, what was that all about?
Does it not taste good?

286
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,022
- Let me try it.
- No, no.

287
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,695
All gone.

288
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,449
So good.

289
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,785
Maybe Chandler has some left.

290
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,582
It tastes like feet.

291
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,335
I like it.

292
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:30,965
Are you kidding?

293
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,760
What's not to like? Custard, good.

294
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,180
Jam, good. Meat, good.

295
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,019
So a bird just grabbed it...

296
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,441
...and then tried
to fly away with it...

297
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,277
...and then just dropped it
on the street?

298
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,990
Yes, but, if it's any consolation,
before the bird dropped it...

299
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,284
...he seemed to enjoy it.

300
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,037
Rachel, come here.

301
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:02,914
Okay.

302
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,667
I was just taking my Thanksgiving nap
and I had another dream about Jack.

303
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,921
- Phoebe, do I want to hear this?
- I don't know, let's see.

304
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,299
Okay, I dreamt we were getting married...

305
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,551
...and he left because
he had to go fight a fire.

306
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:20,139
And, um, so, okay, I went to a nightclub
and I saw him making out with a girl.

307
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,226
Oh, my God, he dream-cheated on you.

308
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,561
Yeah. But then Jacques Cousteau came...

309
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,106
...and he kicked his ass
for betraying me.

310
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,982
It was so cool.

311
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,528
Then he took me diving
and introduced me to his pet sea horse...

312
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:38,157
...who was coming on to me.
And, please, that is not gonna happen.

313
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,080
Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.

314
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,544
Five minutes ago, a line like that
would have floored me.

315
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,756
But now, nothing. Well, not nothing.
I am still a woman.

316
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,095
Ross? Let's go.

317
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,848
Oh, yeah.
About telling Mom and Dad...

318
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,892
...I was thinking about
maybe writing a letter.

319
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,311
You know what?
That's it. You've had your chance.

320
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,775
Mom, Dad. Ross smoked pot in college.

321
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,610
- What?
- What?

322
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,280
You are such a tattletale.

323
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,493
Mom, Dad, heh...

324
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,621
...you remember that time
you walked in my room...

325
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,707
...and smelled marijuana?

326
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,458
- Yes.
- Yes.

327
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,214
I told you it was Chandler...

328
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,801
...who was smoking the pot but...

329
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,139
...it was me. I'm sorry.

330
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,682
It was you?

331
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,560
And, Dad, you know that mailman
that you got fired?

332
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:51,480
He didn't steal your Playboys.
Ross did.

333
00:19:56,361 --> 00:20:00,239
Well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break
the porch swing. Monica did.

334
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,536
Ross hasn't worked
at the museum for a year.

335
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,874
Monica and Chandler
are living together!

336
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:16,881
Ross married Rachel in Vegas.
And got divorced. Again!

337
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,718
I love Jacques Cousteau.

338
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:27,558
I wasn't supposed
to put beef in the trifle.

339
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,478
I want to go!

340
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:37,610
That's a lot of information
to get in 30 seconds.

341
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:42,031
All right. Joey, if you want
to leave, just leave.

342
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:48,037
Rachel, no, you weren't supposed
to put beef in the trifle.

343
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,248
It did not taste good.

344
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,919
Phoebe, I'm sorry...

345
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,422
...but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead.

346
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,843
Monica, why you felt
you had to hide the fact...

347
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,930
...that you're in an important
relationship is beyond me.

348
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,058
And we kind of figured
about the porch swing.

349
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,144
Ross.

350
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,479
Drugs?

351
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,690
Divorced again?

352
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,693
What happened, son?

353
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:23,864
I... I, uh...
I got tricked into all those things.

354
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:30,121
Chandler, you've been
Ross' best friend all these years...

355
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,165
...stuck by him
during the drug problems...

356
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,296
...and now you've taken on
Monica as well.

357
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,757
Well, I don't know what to say.

358
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,884
You're a wonderful human being.

359
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,472
- Thank you.
- No.

360
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,516
Thank you.

361
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:56,814
Monica and Ross, I don't know
what I'm gonna do about the two of you.

362
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,734
I'll talk to them.

363
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,325
You guys, it was bananas...

364
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,910
...cream and beef.

365
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:14,623
I just cannot believe that you ate that
so that I wouldn't feel bad.

366
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,085
Well, actually, I didn't eat mine.
It's still in the bathroom.

367
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,295
No it isn't, I ate that.

368
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,133
And we left ours in Monica's bedroom.

369
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,635
Nope, got it and got yours too.
