1
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:04,545
- Hi, you guys.
- Hey.

2
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:06,255
What's the matter?

3
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:09,466
Well, it's just... It's one
of these situations that I just hate.

4
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:12,386
You know,
a massage client gave me three tickets...

5
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,347
...to the Helmut Peltz Exhibit
at the Morgan Chase Museum.

6
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,850
Now you're thinking
you gotta sleep with him.

7
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:22,688
No. No, it's just that he gave me
three tickets and there are six of us.

8
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:25,315
- I'll give up my ticket.
- Me too.

9
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,484
Okay. That's so generous.

10
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,571
And I think Ross is generous too.

11
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,990
Great. Okay. Then it's just us girls.

12
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,159
- Great.
- Yeah.

13
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,619
So, what is the exhibit?

14
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,497
It's mostly just photographs...

15
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:45,544
...of, um, lesbian love scenes interspersed
with video games and free sandwiches.

16
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,883
Oh, man.

17
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,346
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi there.

18
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,973
Hey, Ross, listen.

19
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,935
Chandler got you out of going to the
lesbian sandwich museum this weekend.

20
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:08,609
Thanks? But I have plans.
Uh, Elizabeth and I are going out of town.

21
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,027
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

22
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,488
Think about all the money
that you're gonna make.

23
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,697
Why? What?

24
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,783
Well, her father pays you
for babysitting, right?

25
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,034
- Uh-oh.
- Ha, ha.

26
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,996
No, no. That's funny.
But maybe it's time to move on.

27
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,831
You know, let it go. Stop it.

28
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,418
Besides, Rachel's going out
with Elizabeth's father.

29
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,546
So, uh, he's much older than she is.

30
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:34,635
Looks like I'm not the only one
interested in fossils. Huh?

31
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:39,431
Ross, all that does is remind us
that you are interested in fossils.

32
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,267
Okay, okay.

33
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:47,940
Uh, well, Rachel's gonna need to yell
sweet nothings in his ear. Huh?

34
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,363
- Ross?
- Oh, come on, that's funny, you know?

35
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,533
Because he's got, like, a hearing aid,
you know?

36
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,410
Because he's all old.

37
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,003
One second.

38
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,715
Okay, look, Ross.

39
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,969
Just so you know,
since Lizzie likes you so much...

40
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,388
...I accept the fact
that you're going out with her.

41
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,473
Really? Okay, that's great.

42
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,393
Yeah. But then I changed my mind.

43
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,270
I'm funny like that.

44
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,106
So I've told Lizzie
and now I'm telling you.

45
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,692
I don't want you seeing
my daughter anymore.

46
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,236
All right, look. I realize it upsets you.

47
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,654
Yes, it does.

48
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,868
But Elizabeth and I are both adults...

49
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:44,872
...and so I don't think there's really
anything you can do about it.

50
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,875
I'll tell the university about
your relationship and have you fired.

51
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,586
Oh, a man with a plan.

52
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:36,131
This is so exciting. You get your picture
back up on the wall of fame.

53
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,800
I know. It was so cool
when it was up there before.

54
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,596
Me and Jim Belushi would just be
cracking up about something.

55
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:46,058
Then I get fired off Days of Our Lives
and he takes me down.

56
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,310
Now he's just laughing at me.

57
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,648
Look at him. That smug Belushi bastard.

58
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,194
Oh. Okay. Maybe when they put
your picture back up...

59
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,529
...they could put you next to Matt Lauer.

60
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,950
Look at him just smiling at me. Hee-hee.

61
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,703
Yeah, I know. We'd be great together.

62
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,668
- Hey. So I'm back.
- Who are you?

63
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,339
Joey Tribbiani.

64
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,174
From the wall?

65
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,010
Okay, maybe this
will jog your memory, huh?

66
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,763
Huh?

67
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,516
Okay, anyway.

68
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:31,603
I'm ready to go back up on the wall.
I'm the star of a new TV show.

69
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:35,774
- Show me in the TV book.
- Oh, well, it's not on TV yet.

70
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,110
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.

71
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,865
Okay, fine. I will bring you a tape. Huh?

72
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,411
So, um, now, do you have any
of Matt Lauer's clothes here?

73
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,372
Maybe just ones
that haven't been cleaned yet?

74
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,084
God.

75
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,631
I love museums.

76
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,967
- Soaking up all the culture.
- Yeah.

77
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,094
- Where do you want to start?
- Ooh, the gift shop.

78
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,721
Yeah.

79
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:09,057
- Hey, and then lunch.
- Oh, wait, yes, but I can't eat too much.

80
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:12,602
Paul's taking me out to dinner tonight.
He said he has a big surprise planned.

81
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,024
Ow, wow. What do you think?
Maybe he's gonna tell you he's gay?

82
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,651
What? No, why?

83
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,238
No reason. That would just be
a really big surprise, right?

84
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:27,701
You could put the aisle over here
and then have the wedding ceremony here.

85
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,120
I didn't know
you could get married here.

86
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,456
This would be a beautiful place
to get married.

87
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:36,084
Yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there.
And I'd never have the ceremony there.

88
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,712
You'd have the ceremony
under this big, beautiful arch.

89
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,464
May I help you?

90
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,051
Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.
It's a beautiful space.

91
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,553
- Do you do a lot of weddings here?
- Yes, we're very popular.

92
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,348
There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry.

93
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,018
Monica, you should totally put
your name down for this place.

94
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,437
What? Are you crazy?

95
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,357
I'm not getting married.
I'm not even engaged.

96
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:02,027
Yeah, but there's a two-year wait.
What if you get engaged in two years?

97
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,404
Then you've gotta wait
another two years for this place?

98
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,074
That's four years.
Chandler's not gonna wait that long.

99
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,076
He's gonna find somebody else,
you know?

100
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,912
- Someone who put their name on the list.
- Mm-hm.

101
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,248
Yeah. Honey, it can't hurt
to put your name down.

102
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,919
If in two years you're not engaged,
you just don't use it.

103
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,214
Well, I guess there is no harm
in putting my name down.

104
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,675
- I'm gonna do it too.
- Me too.

105
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,344
Really? Who would you marry?

106
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,888
I don't know.
I don't have anyone right now, you know?

107
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,348
Oh, Pheebs.

108
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,851
Don't feel too sorry for me.
At least my boyfriend isn't gay.

109
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,690
- Phoebe, that's not...
- Don't even get me started on yours.

110
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,944
Hey.

111
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,072
- So, did you watch the tape of my show?
- I did.

112
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,784
- All right. Let's get me back up there.
- No. You don't go up on the wall.

113
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:56,373
- What? But you saw the show.
- Yes. It was very offensive to my people.

114
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,210
Dry cleaners?

115
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,841
Russians. It showed them
as terrorists and villains.

116
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:09,386
Okay, okay.
Look, you got Harrison Ford up there.

117
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,930
That's right.
Mr. Ford is a very good customer.

118
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,391
He brings us a lot of clothes.
You bring us nothing.

119
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,934
Okay, well, that may be true.

120
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:20,564
But in Air Force One, okay,
the Russians were terrorists and evil.

121
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:24,151
And plus, he kills a bunch of them.
That's offensive to Russians.

122
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,320
- I've never seen it.
- Oh, you should. It's great.

123
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,787
This place is really beautiful.

124
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,833
Yeah. I've been coming here since I was
a kid. This used to be my grandma's.

125
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,545
Wow. The only thing I got
from my grandmother was her eyes. Heh.

126
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,423
I mean, not her actual eyeballs.

127
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,718
But people say that my eyes look...

128
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,095
- Do you want to make out?
- Sure. Ha, ha.

129
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,560
Are you okay?

130
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,978
- What's wrong?
- Uh...

131
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,606
Yeah, I was just thinking
about your father.

132
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,401
- Well, whatever works for you.
- No.

133
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:12,699
No, no. Uh, he just really
freaked me out before.

134
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:13,909
Oh.

135
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:17,120
Well, so we have to hide our relationship
from one more person.

136
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,832
Big deal.
Besides, we've had fun hiding it.

137
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,709
Yeah.

138
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,172
- Hey.
- Yeah.

139
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,965
Um, you brought protection, right?

140
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,927
Why? Are there, like, bears
or something?

141
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,181
- No.
- Oh, uh...

142
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,435
Oh, protection, yeah.
No. That I forgot.

143
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,854
Ha, ha. I'll just run to the store
and get some.

144
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,482
No. Hey, hey. I'm the guy. I'll get it.

145
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,735
- Do you know where the store is?
- No.

146
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,738
Do you want to ride around town
on my little pink bicycle?

147
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,032
A little bit.

148
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,202
- I'll be back in 10 minutes.
- Okay.

149
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,996
Why don't you get in the hot tub
and I'll meet you there.

150
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,998
Oh, okay.

151
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:19,724
Oh, my God. What a great
surprise. This is such a beautiful house.

152
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:23,812
Thank you. It used to be
my mother's. So this is the kitchen.

153
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,196
You've reached Monica and Chandler's.

154
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,824
If you're listening to this message,
we're probably screening.

155
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,909
Yeah, we are.

156
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,621
Hi, this is Hildy
from the Morgan Chase Museum.

157
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,498
I'm calling for Monica Geller.

158
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,750
I want to let her know
there was a cancellation.

159
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,838
If she's still interested in having
the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility...

160
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,173
...it is available.

161
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,968
This is Chandler Bing.
This is Chandler Bing.

162
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,513
Yes, the groom. No, not the groom!

163
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,645
It's so secluded up here.

164
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,649
- I know. That's why I like it here.
- Mm-hm.

165
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,485
I feel like we're the only two people
in the world.

166
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,489
Whoops. Sorry.

167
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,288
What's the matter, honey?

168
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,708
- Did you see a little mouse?
- No. Big bear. Big bear outside.

169
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:27,876
I think I...

170
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,587
Actually, would you go check on that?

171
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,631
Honey, we don't have any bears here.

172
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,257
Well, okay.

173
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,468
Would you get me a Diet Coke?

174
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,555
- Okay. Be right back.
- Okay.

175
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,604
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

176
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:51,232
- I came with Paul.
- Yeah. I recognized the ankles.

177
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,942
Hurry up. Get out.

178
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,487
Here you go, honey.

179
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,074
- Ah. Thank you.
- Diet Coke.

180
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,868
Oh. Ice.

181
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,453
I need ice.

182
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,873
Okay.

183
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,333
- Thank you.
- Be right back.

184
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,210
Okay.

185
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,546
- You and your ice.
- Oh.

186
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,549
Get out. Get out. Go. Come on.

187
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,343
Quick.

188
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,263
No, not in there! Not in there!
He's in there!

189
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,809
- Did you really hear a bear?
- Go!

190
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,480
Here you go, honey.

191
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,484
One Diet Coke with ice.

192
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,112
Oh, thank you.

193
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,074
I am so happy that you're here.

194
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,785
- Here I am.
- Elizabeth.

195
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,662
Oh, look. Elizabeth's here.

196
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,417
Who were you talking to?

197
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,460
You guys?

198
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,630
How did you know we were here?

199
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,092
- Um...
- Well, she obviously saw the tire tracks...

200
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,011
...that were leading up
to the closed garage.

201
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,514
Obviously. Heh.

202
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:09,644
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?

203
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,903
Did you come up here to work on
that term paper or something?

204
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,530
Yeah. Yeah.

205
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:24,159
Well, why don't you, you know,
go in that room and do your homework?

206
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,829
Oh, I wouldn't do it in there.
Um, that's my dad's bedroom.

207
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,042
That's your dad's bedroom.

208
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,713
Ha, ha. That's your dad's bedroom.

209
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,048
Ho-ho.

210
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,800
- Why are you yelling?
- Oh!

211
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:44,596
That Diet Coke, I think,
went straight to my head. Whoo!

212
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,727
Hi, honey.

213
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,562
See you later.

214
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,857
Wait. I bought groceries.
I was gonna make you dinner.

215
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,067
Well, next time, ask.

216
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,072
Or at least wait for me to ask.

217
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,586
Hi, this is Hildy
from the Morgan Chase Museum.

218
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,421
I'm calling for Monica Geller.

219
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,798
Oh, no.

220
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,133
I wanna let her know
there's been a cancellation.

221
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:26,346
If she's still interested in having
the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility...

222
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,972
...it is available.

223
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,682
Please. He didn't hear it.

224
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,602
This is Chandler Bing.
This is Chandler Bing.

225
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,647
No!

226
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,109
Can I help you?

227
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:44,280
Uh, yeah. Where's the guy who decides
whose pictures go up on the wall?

228
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,450
- He's not here right now.
- Oh, you're kidding me.

229
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:51,746
All right, well, make sure you tell him that
Joey Tribbiani dropped off these clothes.

230
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,041
Okay? I'm an actor. I'm trying to get
my picture up there on the wall.

231
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:59,337
You know, there are two people
who could get your picture up there.

232
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,589
Oh, really?

233
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,593
Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks.

234
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,929
You're the other one, right?

235
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,935
So, Lizzie, are you planning
on staying the night?

236
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,313
Oh, no, no. Believe me,
I'm leaving as soon as possible.

237
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:22,777
Good, good. Not that we don't want you
to stay. Obviously, you're welcome.

238
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,196
How much more homework
do you have?

239
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:29,826
Uh, I just have one problem left
that I do not know how to solve.

240
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,288
Uh, Rachel, maybe you want to
come upstairs and help me figure it out?

241
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,956
Really?

242
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,166
Okay.

243
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,502
Okay, I'll go upstairs...

244
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,047
...if you get me something from the car.

245
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,049
What do you need from the car?

246
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,427
Surprise me.

247
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,097
- Okay.
- Okay.

248
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,726
So you're gonna be in the car.
I will be upstairs.

249
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,853
And that's where everybody's gonna be.

250
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,088
Just relax. Just relax, Paul.
You're doing great.

251
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,090
She likes you. She...

252
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,052
I think she likes you. She likes you.

253
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:33,139
You know why?
Because you're a neat guy.

254
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:40,438
You are the man.

255
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,735
Still got it.

256
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,321
Still sexy.

257
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,324
You're just a love machine.

258
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,369
I'm just a love machine

259
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,665
So proud of what you have, baby

260
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,176
Showtime.

261
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:16,057
I'm just a love machine
Hey, baby

262
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,351
- Phoebe?
- Yeah?

263
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,144
- Have you seen Chandler?
- No, why?

264
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,231
The woman from the museum called
and said that there was a cancellation...

265
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,566
...and we could move up our wedding.
Chandler heard.

266
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,778
I know. How bad is this?

267
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:33,074
Well, with a regular guy, it's bad.
With Chandler, oh, dear God.

268
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,662
I know. I know. He totally freaked out
and I can't find him anywhere.

269
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,207
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- I'm never listening to you again, for sure.

270
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,669
"What harm can it do
to put your name down?"

271
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,714
- Rachel said that.
- Well, Rachel's not here!

272
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,015
Ooh, here it is.

273
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,101
Ooh, Joey, why did you sign it,
"son of a bitch"?

274
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,691
- I didn't do that. Who would've done that?
- Son of a bitch.

275
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,527
Okay. Maybe ask this guy.

276
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,654
You. Get out of my shop.

277
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,906
- What did he do?
- He went out with my wife.

278
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,701
- Joey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

279
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,204
Hey, I did not go out with your wife.
Okay?

280
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,707
- I went out with her.
- That's my wife.

281
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,001
Get out!

282
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,548
- Well, we should go.
- Yeah.

283
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:37,597
Ross?

284
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,682
Elizabeth.

285
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,731
Okay. Okay.
I'm gonna go out this window.

286
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,274
I'll meet you at the front door.

287
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,235
- Just tell them you're going home, okay?
- Okay.

288
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,446
Wait, wait. No, don't go in there.

289
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,157
Don't go in there. I need another soda.

290
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,701
Ross.

291
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,790
Oh, my God. Ross, what in heaven's name
are you doing here?

292
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:10,713
And that is why we cannot
see each other anymore.

293
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,886
Ross, you and I are gonna have
to have a little talk.

294
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,179
- Daddy, I...
- You're next.

295
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,015
Okay. I didn't know he was here.

296
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,728
Let me just see if I got this straight.

297
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:29,190
I tell you to stay away from my daughter
or I'll have you fired.

298
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,901
What you heard was:
"Take my daughter...

299
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,862
...come up to my country house
and ruin my weekend with Rachel."

300
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:40,201
- Okay. Please, Paul. Just let me explain.
- No. Let me explain. Fired.

301
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:44,664
Okay, fine. Fine. Have me fired.

302
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,543
But, uh, I want you to know...

303
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,964
...that you and I are not all that different.
I mean...

304
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,717
...l, too, am a neat guy.

305
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,395
What?

306
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,440
And I, too...

307
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,609
...am just a love machine.

308
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,506
Ross.

309
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,719
Let me show you
where the guest room is.

310
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,233
I'm so sorry. Please stop freaking out.

311
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,028
I'm not freaking out.

312
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,573
Why would I freak out?

313
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,075
A woman named Hildy called
and said we were getting married.

314
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,411
But that happens every day. Ah-ah-ah!

315
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,167
Honey, we were at this beautiful place.

316
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,711
And I just put our names down for fun.

317
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,713
- I mean, what's the harm in that?
- Right here.

318
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,636
Please don't think I was trying
to pressure you.

319
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,055
- Phoebe and Rachel just thought...
- Phoebe and Rachel?

320
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,683
So the people that knew
about our wedding before me were you...

321
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,560
...Phoebe and Rachel, Hildy...

322
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,313
...and apparently some band called
Star Light Magic Seven...

323
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,024
...who are available, by the way.

324
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,361
It was a mistake.

325
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:42,156
Please don't take this to mean anything,
because it doesn't.

326
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,327
Okay.

327
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,412
Really?

328
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:52,500
Yes. If it really doesn't mean anything,
because you know I'm just not ready.

329
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,753
I know.

330
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,546
Okay.

331
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,340
All right.

332
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,176
Now, I'm gonna go tell Joey
that you're back.

333
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,679
We were really worried about you.

334
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:13,187
- Hey, did she buy it?
- Totally.

335
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:17,525
- So did Hildy show you the place?
- Yeah. It's beautiful.

336
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,861
I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica
to marry you.

337
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,321
I know.

338
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,168
- Hey, Gunther.
- Take these cappuccinos to Table 11.

339
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,671
And that guy over there wants
some biscotti.

340
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,216
Oh. Well, I just actually came in
for a cup of coffee to go.

341
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,012
Do you still work here?

342
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,308
No, no. I quit a long time ago.

343
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,060
Did I forget to tell you that? I'm sorry.

344
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,147
- Oh, it's cool. I was gonna fire you anyway.
- Great.
