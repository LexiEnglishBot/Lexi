1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:03,794
- Ready? Okay.
- Yeah.

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:07,006
- Hi. Rachel. Phoebe's.
- It's. And.

3
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,507
- Please.
- Leave.

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,092
Leave.

5
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,344
But I just said "leave."

6
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,639
Yeah, I know,
because you have all the good words.

7
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:20,477
What do I get? I get "it's, and."
Oh, I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.

8
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,689
- Come on, that's silly.
- All right. So let's switch.

9
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,567
No, I have all the good words.

10
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,736
Okay, fine, fine. We can switch.

11
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,821
- Okay.
- Okay.

12
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:32,948
- Hi.
- Everybody.

13
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,241
- It's.
- Rachel.

14
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,492
- And.
- Phoebe's.

15
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,619
Pleas... Wait. How did you do that?

16
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,204
What?

17
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,958
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate,
are you?

18
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,713
Phoebe, come on, can we finish this later?
I wanna go running before it gets dark.

19
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,923
- Why don't you come with me?
- Really?

20
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,258
Yeah, oh, it'll be fun.

21
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:55,387
We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first,
you know, roommate-bonding thing.

22
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,056
Okay, let's go running!

23
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,725
- Yeah, and there's cute guys there.
- Let's run towards them!

24
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,351
Okay.

25
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,520
Wait just one more second.

26
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,398
Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's.
Please leave a message. Thanks!

27
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,443
Now, wait a minute.
You just took all the words.

28
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,279
Uh-huh. You've met your match,
Rachel Green.

29
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,989
- So I just finished this fascinating book.
- Hmm.

30
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:59,493
By the year 2030,
there'll be computers...

31
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:04,706
...that can carry out the same amount
of functions as an actual human brain.

32
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,042
So, theoretically,
you could download...

33
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,754
...your thoughts and memories
into this computer...

34
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:15,843
...and live forever as a machine.

35
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:23,183
And I just realized I can sleep
with my eyes open.

36
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,687
- Hey.
- Hey.

37
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:31,024
Honey, it was a great idea,
nailing the boxes to the floor.

38
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,530
- I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
- Oh, so you can move them.

39
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,031
Yes.

40
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,952
Yes, and while I'm doing that,
Ross has a great computer story for you.

41
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,832
Hey, everybody.
Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,626
She's gonna be my new roommate.

43
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,338
- Hi.
- Hi.

44
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,382
And she's gonna live with me!

45
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,303
It's nice to meet you. Janine?

46
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,804
Lecroix. Janine Lecroix.

47
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,765
I didn't know that.
What a pretty last name.

48
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,643
So, uh, where are you from?

49
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,979
Australia. I just moved here
a couple of weeks ago.

50
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,689
- From the land down under?
- Yeah.

51
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,858
I didn't know that either.

52
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,694
So, what do you do?

53
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,780
- I'm a dancer.
- You're a dancer?

54
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,491
She's a dancer.

55
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,330
- Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
- Here, let me...

56
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,089
- Joey?
- Yeah?

57
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,551
Did you even interview this woman
before you asked her to move in?

58
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,470
- Of course I did.
- Uh-huh.

59
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,013
What exactly did you ask her?

60
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,973
When can you move in?

61
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,479
Thank you for bringing her
into our lives.

62
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,148
Unbelievable.

63
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,609
Oh. Oh, so you like her too, Chandler?

64
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,819
Hey, look at all the boxes.

65
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,740
I cannot wait to ask her out.

66
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,076
Wait a minute, Joey.
Joey, you can't ask her out.

67
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,954
She's your roommate.
It'll be way too complicated.

68
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,580
Yeah, man, don't do it.

69
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,542
I mean, if you date her,
then I can't date her.

70
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,838
Think about it. Remember when you were
going out with Donna and you broke up...

71
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:20,217
...remember how horrible it was when
you bumped into her at the supermarket?

72
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,843
Oh, God, yeah.

73
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,680
Now imagine you live
at the supermarket.

74
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,348
Okay.

75
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,268
- No, no.
- Oh. Oh.

76
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,646
You're right. I don't want that.
I can't date her.

77
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,774
And you'd better watch the flirting too,
because in close quarters...

78
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,652
...it could be trouble.
- Well, that's gonna be tough, Mon.

79
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,572
I mean, it's hard for me to be around
an attractive woman and not flirt.

80
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,743
Heh. Well, you're around me all the time,
and you don't flirt.

81
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,080
A little sad about that, sweetie?

82
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,754
I have to tie my shoes,
so you go ahead. I'll catch up.

83
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,756
- Okay.
- Okay.

84
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,763
Come on, that's not running.
Let's go!

85
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,771
You guys, I'm telling you,
when she runs...

86
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,274
...she looks like a cross
between Kermit the Frog...

87
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,401
...and the Six Million Dollar Man.

88
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,281
Monica had such a crush on him. Ha, ha.

89
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,910
She used to kiss his poster
every night before she went to bed.

90
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,287
I used to do that too.

91
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,915
Oh, my God. Did you also have his album,
It's Not Easy Being Green?

92
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,086
Oh, Mon.

93
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,965
So Phoebe runs weird, huh?

94
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,052
Yeah. And you know what?
And I know she's gonna want to run again.

95
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,013
I don't know how to get out of it.
I mean, I live with her.

96
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,516
Why don't you just be straight with her?
Tell her the truth.

97
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:55,062
You're right. You're right.
I should just tell her the truth.

98
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,396
- Hey.
- Hey.

99
00:05:56,564 --> 00:06:00,525
Hey, Pheebs, Monica tripped me.
I don't think I can ever run again, ever.

100
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,196
Why? Why would you do that?

101
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,323
I don't know.

102
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,493
Rachel, I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.

103
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,245
- Ankle.
- We'll see.

104
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,336
Okay. I am officially unpacked.

105
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,463
Thanks for helping me, man.

106
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,173
Joe?

107
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,015
Well, I guess Joey went home.

108
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,478
Oh, and look, there is still one box
that I have to unpack.

109
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:40,941
I got you.

110
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:46,279
Oh, my God,
you almost gave me a heart attack.

111
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,200
It was so hard not to laugh, I'll tell you.

112
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,494
Hey, the place looks great.

113
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,829
Yeah, not bad, right?

114
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:57,833
You know what? Monica's working late,
so I'm gonna make this place spotless.

115
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,043
You know what else I'm gonna do?

116
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,088
I'm gonna go downstairs,
I'm gonna get her some flowers.

117
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,965
Now, who would not want
to live with me?

118
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,925
I don't.

119
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,971
No, I want to live with
the super-hot Australian dancer.

120
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,182
How's that going, though?
Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?

121
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,476
Yeah, so far. Yeah.
But it's tough, you know?

122
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:20,522
I've got all this built-up flirting energy,
and I don't know how to get rid of it.

123
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,318
How you doing?

124
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,867
Oh, man.

125
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,953
Sorry. There's just more room out here.

126
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:41,460
Oh, no, no, you just, uh, reminded me
that I have to do my stretches too.

127
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,509
- Why don't you try to be?
- Aah!

128
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,678
- What's wrong?
- Uh, nothing.

129
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,930
I just... I didn't want you to touch me...

130
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,267
...because I'm all sweaty
from the workout. Ha, ha.

131
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,768
I'm gonna hit the shower.

132
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,523
Oh, my God.

133
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,692
Oh, sorry about that stuff
hanging in there.

134
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,737
It's just my thongs are too delicate
for the dryer.

135
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,833
- Aah!
- Hi.

136
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,418
Oh, yeah, uh-huh, it's me.

137
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,880
I saw you grab your running shoes
this morning and sneak out.

138
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,257
You lied so you could run by yourself.

139
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,134
No, Phoebe, no. I was... No.

140
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,470
I was actually just checking...

141
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,804
...to see...

142
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,723
...if I could run. And I can.

143
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,642
Please, Rachel, I'm not an idiot.

144
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,935
No, wait. Phoebe?

145
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,575
Wow. Couples who live together
do start to look alike.

146
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,287
So, Mondler...

147
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,039
Uh...

148
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,876
What, uh...? What are you doing?

149
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,295
What does it look like? I am cleaning.

150
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,799
Did you get Monica's authorization
to move all of her stuff?

151
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,635
Authorizat... I don't need that.
I'm gonna put everything back.

152
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,096
Put it back exactly where you found it?

153
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,474
Yes. I'm gonna put it back
exactly where I found it.

154
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,978
Okay, first of all,
that attitude is not helping.

155
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,064
She won't care if I put her stuff
back in the same stupid place.

156
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,651
Hello? Did you just meet Monica?

157
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,154
She's gonna recognize
that I did a nice thing...

158
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,615
...and appreciate it.

159
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,368
Huh. No, actually, this will work out well.

160
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,662
Because when you have to move back
with Joey...

161
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,623
...Joey's hot new roommate
can come live with me.

162
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,876
Oh, I see, I see.
You're trying to freak me out.

163
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:51,673
Look, Chandler, Monica is really weird
about this kind of stuff, all right?

164
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:56,636
Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years.
She's going to freak out.

165
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,598
Oh, my God. She's going to sit on you.

166
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,559
No, she is not, okay?
I'll prove it to you.

167
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,728
I'm gonna call her right now.

168
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,439
Phone's done.

169
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,568
- Hi.
- Hey, Mon. How's it going?

170
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,904
Terrible. If I want something done right,
I have to do it myself.

171
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,823
Other people just wreck stuff.

172
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,952
I really think
I might kill someone tonight.

173
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,582
Oh, come on, come on,
it can't be that bad.

174
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,751
It's worse.
The only thing getting me through...

175
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,628
...is knowing I'm gonna see you soon.

176
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,964
- I might get out of here early.
- No. No, no, no.

177
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,175
No, no, it sounds like
they need you there.

178
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,928
- You're just hanging out with Ross?
- It's all good. Okay, bye, Mon.

179
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,223
She's gonna kill me.

180
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,435
The phone was facing the other way.

181
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,188
And that goes back up there.

182
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,444
Know what we should do?
We should start with the big stuff.

183
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:58,114
That'll be the easiest.
So, uh, let's start with the couch.

184
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,950
I got it.

185
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,373
Yeah, that doesn't look right.

186
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,751
What are you talking about? The couch
is perfectly in line with the carpet.

187
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,464
Then I can just walk over here
and casually just put my feet right up on...

188
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,800
Okay, here's what we do.

189
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,886
We just move the couch closer
to the coffee table.

190
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,139
But then the back of the couch
won't line up with the back of the carpet.

191
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,476
Okay, well, here,
we'll just, uh, move the coffee table...

192
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,686
...closer to the couch.

193
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:33,775
No, whoa, whoa! But then the coffee table
won't be centered in the seating area.

194
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:37,362
But the coffee table doesn't
match the table... Ross.

195
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,617
Hi. Look, what am I gonna do?

196
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:47,038
I'm not flirting, but still I'm drawing
her to me like a moth to a flame.

197
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,879
What the hell's going on over here?

198
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,841
Monica's gonna kill you.

199
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,802
Look, I need your help, okay?

200
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,681
I have to do something
to repel this woman.

201
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,683
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

202
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,685
You guys repel women all the time.

203
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,106
Hey, I've been married three times.

204
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,196
No, no, no, I've seen it happen.

205
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:24,075
You get a rapport going with a woman,
but somehow you manage to kill it.

206
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,703
What's your secret?

207
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,498
Look, we do not repel women, okay?

208
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,584
That is completely untrue.

209
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,712
Oh, yes, we do, my man.

210
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,298
Remember back in college
when we went to that dance...

211
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,718
...and you walked right up to that girl
you liked and couldn't stop talking...

212
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,137
...about the Irish potato famine?

213
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,308
Yeah, well, what about you?
You weren't so hot in college either.

214
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,893
After everything he said, he'd go:

215
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,649
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either.
Maybe I should stop doing that.

216
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,737
You know what? Girls don't like it
when I start talking about science.

217
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,198
That's not specific to girls.

218
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,868
This is great. This is great. What else?

219
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,037
They don't like you correcting
their grammar.

220
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,582
And they don't like it when you
explain why your jokes are funny.

221
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:17,962
You know, they don't like it when you
keep asking them if they like you.

222
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:22,592
- Man, I am so lucky I have Monica.
- I'm never gonna find love again.

223
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,972
Hey.

224
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,600
- Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

225
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:34,187
Okay. Um, I...

226
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,484
Phoebe, look, I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry, okay?

227
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,111
I handled the situation horribly.

228
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,447
And I should not have lied to you.

229
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,367
So what should you have done?

230
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,828
Well, I should have told you the truth.

231
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,372
Uh-huh. Which is?

232
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:58,211
Well, you know, the reason that
I didn't want to go running with you is...

233
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,921
...because, um...

234
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,132
...well, you know, the way that you run
is just a little...

235
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,345
- So?
- Well, it's embarrassing.

236
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,556
People were looking at us
like we were crazy.

237
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,809
- Why do you care?
- Because they're people.

238
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,854
But people that you don't know
and will never see again.

239
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,314
Yes, but still they are people...

240
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,316
...with eyes.

241
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,778
Well, I didn't get embarrassed
running next to Miss:

242
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,197
Choo, choo, choo, choo.

243
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,867
But, oh, okay.

244
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:33,204
No, no, I can see why running with me
would be embarrassing to you.

245
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,206
Yeah, okay. You're uptight.

246
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:39,836
What? I am not uptight. Whoa.

247
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:44,591
Listen, I am not uptight, man.

248
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,262
That's okay, Rachel. I'm not judging you.
That's just who you are.

249
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,099
Me, I'm more free, you know?
I run like I did when I was a kid...

250
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,019
...because that's the only way it's fun,
you know?

251
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:59,522
I mean, didn't you ever run so fast
you thought your legs would fall off...

252
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,191
...you know, like, when you were
running towards the swings...

253
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,986
...or running away from Satan?

254
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,116
The neighbor's dog.

255
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,914
Okay, is this lamp in the right place?

256
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,708
Who cares? I repel women.

257
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,379
No, no, no! You can't come in here.

258
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,131
Ross is naked!

259
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,886
- What?
- What?

260
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:34,015
I couldn't say that I was naked,
because she's allowed to see me naked.

261
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,559
Why does anyone have to be naked?

262
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,230
Why is Ross naked?

263
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:47,403
I had to show Chandler something.

264
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,699
Naked?

265
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,910
Yeah, I uh...

266
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,079
I guess I have, a, uh...

267
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,373
A guy problem.

268
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,086
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?

269
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,674
Look, just come back later.

270
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,301
We'll get everything squared away,
and you can come back later.

271
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,678
Okay. Hey, listen.

272
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:15,431
There's still some of Chandler's medicine
left under the sink in the bathroom.

273
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,101
- Bye.
- Bye.

274
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,233
Thank God.

275
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,571
Dude, what'd you have?

276
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,784
Look, we have no time, okay?
We must focus.

277
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,745
We've got to get everything
back into its original place.

278
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,038
The photo album.

279
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:43,126
There were millions of pictures
of the apartment in the photo album.

280
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,920
We just go through it
and match everything to the pictures.

281
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,798
- That's perfect. That's brilliant.
- Yeah.

282
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,386
So really, what did you have?

283
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,932
Hey, Joey. I've got some beer for you.

284
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,687
Uh, don't you mean "for whom"?

285
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,857
Sure.

286
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,318
Listen, I was gonna order some pizza.
You wanna share one?

287
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,738
Pizza? It's not like I never
had that before.

288
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,368
Is there something wrong?

289
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,663
All right, all right.

290
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,833
Let's just get this out in the open, okay?

291
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,501
You're hot.

292
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,212
I'm lovable.

293
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,382
Clearly, there's a vibe
going on between us.

294
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,843
But we're roommates...

295
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,597
...and it's a huge mistake for us
to continue down this road.

296
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,515
- Joey...
- No, no, no. I'm telling you.

297
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:43,061
Imagine yourself living in a supermarket
and you'll understand.

298
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,941
Okay? So the question is,
what do we do?

299
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,235
Well, I don't think
there is anything to do.

300
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,654
I mean, I think you're really sweet.

301
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,324
But I'm just not interested
in you like that.

302
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,580
Oh.

303
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,665
No, I mean...

304
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:10,505
You're a really nice guy, and I'm happy
to be your roommate and your friend.

305
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,632
I'm just, you know, I just...

306
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,010
...don't feel that way about you.

307
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,221
Oh.

308
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,307
I see what happened. Ha, ha.

309
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,935
It's because I was trying to repel you.

310
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:29,190
Right? Believe me, you'd feel
a lot different if I turned it on.

311
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,568
- I don't think so.
- Oh, I do.

312
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,657
How you doing?

313
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,202
I'm okay.

314
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,706
What?

315
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,126
Oh, dear God.

316
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,092
Choo, choo, choo.

317
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,396
- Hey!
- Hi!

318
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,400
I'm so sorry. You're right.
This feels great.

319
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,610
See? And you don't care
if people are staring.

320
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,446
It's just for a second,
because then you're gone.

321
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:21,117
It's amazing, Pheebs.
I feel so free and so graceful.

322
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,577
Oh!

323
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,957
Ha! Hey, look out for the horse.

324
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,208
Sorry.

325
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,966
Is it okay for me to come in now?

326
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,676
Uh-huh.

327
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,727
- Why is everything different?
- Bye.

328
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,106
I don't see anything different...

329
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,693
...other than the fact that the room got
so much brighter when you came into it.

330
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,489
Well, the end table is wrong,
the couch looks bizarre...

331
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,117
...and don't even get me started
on the refrigerator magnets.

332
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,163
Okay, look, don't be mad, okay?

333
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:11,834
But after I unpacked the boxes,
I wanted to do something nice for you...

334
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,921
...so I cleaned the apartment.

335
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,840
So I moved everything around,
and then I forgot...

336
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:22,595
...where it went back. And I'm sorry,
I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

337
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,598
That's okay.

338
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,351
Chandler, are you afraid of me
or something?

339
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,187
Do you want me to be afraid of you?

340
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,482
Of course not.

341
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:38,027
My gosh, Chandler,
what you did is a wonderful thing...

342
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,946
...and I really appreciate it.

343
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,699
I know I have this thing where I want
everything in the perfect place.

344
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,285
But I'd never expect you
to worry about that.

345
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,162
Really?

346
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,706
Of course.

347
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,875
Oh, you're the best.

348
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,669
You come here to me.

349
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,964
Hold on, okay? First things first.

350
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,757
Okay. Now...

351
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,677
Did Ross sit anywhere
while he was naked?

352
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,850
So it said that by the year 2030...

353
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:13,271
...there will be computers carrying
out the same number of functions...

354
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,564
...as an actual human brain.

355
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:19,235
So theoretically, you could
download your thoughts...

356
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,612
...and your memories
into this computer...

357
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,198
And live forever as a machine.

358
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:32,164
Uh, so, Janine, do you know
what we're doing right now?

359
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,085
You and I, we're interfacing.

360
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,297
Yeah. I gotta go.
