1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,128
Ross kissed me.

2
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,768
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

3
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:10,406
It was unbelievable!

4
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:13,703
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

5
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:15,278
Let's hear everything.

6
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,082
Monica, get the wine
and unplug the phone.

7
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:21,782
Rachel, does this end well
or do we need to get tissues?

8
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,290
It ended very well.

9
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:28,292
Do not start without me!
Do not start without me!

10
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:31,121
Okay. All right.
Let's hear about the kiss.

11
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,730
Was it a soft brush
against your lips...

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,663
...or was it a "I gotta have you now"
kind of thing?

13
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:42,234
Well, at first it was really intense,
you know? And then...

14
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:45,808
Oh, God. And then we just
sort of sunk into it.

15
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,607
So was he holding you?
Or were his hands on your back?

16
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:53,285
No, actually, first
they started out on my waist...

17
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:56,111
...and then they slid up
and were in my hair.

18
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:00,424
And...

19
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,957
...then I kissed her.

20
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:02,991
Tongue?

21
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,991
- Yeah.
- Cool.

22
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,660
The One With the List

23
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,070
All right, check out this bad boy!

24
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,611
Twelve megabytes of RAM,
500-megabyte hard drive...

25
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,646
...built-in spreadsheet capabilities...

26
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:03,685
...and a modem that transmits
at over 28,000 BPS.

27
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,785
What will you use it for?

28
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,388
Games and stuff.

29
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,890
There are no jobs.
There are no jobs for me.

30
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,894
Oh, wait, here's one.

31
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:19,898
- Would you be willing to cook naked?
- There's an ad for a naked chef?

32
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,839
No, but if you'll cook naked, then
you might be willing to dance naked.

33
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,510
And then...

34
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,343
So how'd you make out last night?

35
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,724
That is funny.
That is painfully funny.

36
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,323
No, wait, wait.

37
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,857
Yeah, that's just painful.

38
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,189
Wait a minute.
I thought last night was great.

39
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,297
Yeah, it was.
But I get home...

40
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:51,695
...and I see Julie's saline solution
on my night table...

41
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,403
...and I think,
"My God! What am I doing?"

42
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,508
Here I am with Julie,
this incredible, great woman...

43
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,406
...who I care about
and who cares about me...

44
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,739
...and I'm just
throwing all that away?

45
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,340
You got all that
from saline solution?

46
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:10,947
I'm the same way. Show me a bottle
of wine. And I'm like, Wow, who am I?

47
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:16,491
Wait. We're talking about Rachel.
You and Rachel.

48
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,664
I've been dreaming about
me and Rachel for 10 years.

49
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,628
But now I'm with Julie.

50
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,734
So it's like, me and Julie,
me and Rachel.

51
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,063
Me and Julie, me and Rach

52
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,866
Rachel! Rachel.

53
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,202
- Hey, you.
- How are you?

54
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,910
Good. How are you?

55
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,146
Good.

56
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,015
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie?

57
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:39,781
Julie!

58
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:42,651
How are you?

59
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,049
Good.

60
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,888
So everybody's here.

61
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,685
Everybody's good.

62
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,163
Good, Great, and here!

63
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,595
Were you gonna play something?

64
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,871
- Well, actually
- Play it!

65
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,268
All right.

66
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,605
- Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
- What?

67
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,414
Okay. Hi.

68
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,183
Hello. Hi. Okay.

69
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,745
This is a song about a love triangle...

70
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,990
...between three people I made up.

71
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,557
It's called
"Two of Them Kissed Last Night."

72
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,831
There was a girl
We'll call her Betty

73
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,337
And a guy
Let's call him Neil

74
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,910
Now I can't stress
This point too strongly

75
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:43,342
This story isn't real

76
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:51,218
Now our Neil must decide
Who will be the girl that he casts aside

77
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,651
Will Betty be the one
Who he loves truly

78
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:57,225
Or will it be the one
Who we'll call Loolie

79
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,197
He must decide
He must decide

80
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,802
Even though I made him up
He must decide

81
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,976
Well, this is a nice resume.

82
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,547
Nice, nice, nice.

83
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,709
Muy impressivo.

84
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,184
Shame! It not all true.

85
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:23,188
Forget it.

86
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,192
No, it's all true.
I'm just a little nervous, that's all!

87
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,490
I am fine now.

88
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:33,430
Mr. Rastatter, what does this
job entail? The ad wasn't clear.

89
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,132
Macholate.

90
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,231
- I'm sorry?
- Macholate.

91
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,699
It's a synthetic chocolate substitute.

92
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,534
Go ahead, try a piece.

93
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,770
We think Macholate is
even better than chocolate.

94
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:49,982
All right.

95
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,123
I love how it crumbles.

96
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,695
- You see, chocolate doesn't do that.
- No, ma'am.

97
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,767
We should be getting
our FDA approval any day now.

98
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,904
Hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving.

99
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,573
The way we see it,
chocolate dominates...

100
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:20,609
...your major food-preparation holidays.
Easter, Christmas, what have you.

101
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,905
But given the right marketing...

102
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,616
...we can make Thanksgiving
the Macholate holiday.

103
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,084
Wow.

104
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,953
Aren't you gonna swallow that?

105
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,091
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.

106
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,726
Isn't that great?

107
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,559
Well, anyhow...

108
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:43,290
...we're looking for chefs
who can create Thanksgiving recipes.

109
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,763
You interested?

110
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:45,834
Abso...

111
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:48,364
...- lutely!

112
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,767
I love creating recipes,
I love Thanksgiving, and now...

113
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,172
...I love Macholate.

114
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,470
Really?

115
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,343
Especially that aftertaste.
I tell you...

116
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,610
...that'll last you till Christmas.

117
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,658
How about Macholate mousse?

118
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,320
It's not...

119
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,153
...very Thanksgiving-y.

120
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,155
How about Pilgrim Macholate mousse?

121
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,360
What makes it Pilgrim?

122
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,532
We'll put buckles on it.

123
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,302
Did Ross call?

124
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,203
No, I'm sorry.

125
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,543
Why didn't he call?

126
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,572
He's gonna stay with Julie.

127
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,874
He's gonna stay with her
and she'll be:

128
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,380
"Hi, I'm Julie. Ross picked me.

129
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:38,714
We'll get married and have lots
of kids and dig up stuff together!"

130
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:43,054
No offense, but that
sounds nothing like her.

131
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:50,025
What am I gonna do?
This is like a complete nightmare!

132
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,399
I know. This must be so hard.
"Oh, no! Two women love me!

133
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:59,006
They're both gorgeous,
my wallet's too small for my 50s...

134
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,713
...and my diamond shoes are too tight!"

135
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,676
- Here's a thought
- Don't ever touch the computer.

136
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,884
Ross, listen.
I got two words for you:

137
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,316
Threesome.

138
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,559
You still have another
word if you wanna use it.

139
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:25,359
Hey, I think I know what is it, HELP!

140
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,368
Let's get logical about this.
We'll make a list.

141
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,008
"Rachel and Julie: Pros and Cons."

142
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,910
We'll put their names
in different fonts...

143
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,584
...and I can use different
colors for each column.

144
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,213
Can't we use a pen?

145
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,352
No, Amish boy.

146
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,988
Let's start with the cons
because they're more fun.

147
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,092
Rachel first.

148
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,257
I don't know.

149
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,027
I mean...

150
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:59,762
All right, I guess you can say
she's a little spoiled sometimes.

151
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,900
You could say that.

152
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:07,745
I guess, sometimes
she's a little ditzy, you know?

153
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:11,014
And I've seen her be a little
too into her looks.

154
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,742
And Julie and I have
a lot in common...

155
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,886
...because we're both
paleontologists, right?

156
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,953
But Rachel's just a waitress.

157
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,590
Waitress.

158
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,128
Got it.
You guys want to play Doom?

159
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,957
Or we could keep doing this.

160
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:30,929
What else?

161
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,901
I don't know.

162
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,442
Oh! Her ankles are a little chubby.

163
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,609
Okay, let's do Julie.

164
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,141
What's wrong with her?

165
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,751
She's not Rachel.

166
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,823
This is pumpkin pie
with a Macholate crust.

167
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:56,722
This is Macholate cranberry cake,
and these are Macholate-chip cookies.

168
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,054
Just like the Indians served.

169
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:03,565
Oh, my God!

170
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:04,800
"Oh, my God" good?

171
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,631
Oh, my God! I can't believe
you let me put this in my mouth.

172
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:13,370
Sweet Lord!
This is what evil must taste like!

173
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,214
I tell you, it won't print.

174
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,116
I pressed that button, like, 100 times.

175
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,291
For a hotline, you're not so hot.

176
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,457
What is that in the background?

177
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,129
Are you watching Star Trek?

178
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,904
So how was going with Julie.
Did you break her heart?

179
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:48,903
It was horrible. She cried, I cried.
She threw things, they hit me.

180
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:52,944
I did the right thing.

181
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,777
So Spock actually hugs his father?

182
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,552
Hey, do you guys have

183
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:04,727
Where you going?

184
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,330
I just got back...

185
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,795
...from Julie's.

186
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,494
No, no.

187
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,602
It's not what you think.

188
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,467
It's the other thing.

189
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,578
Well, what's the other thing?
What do I think?

190
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,015
Well...

191
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,449
He broke up with Julie!

192
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,254
Well, go hug her, for God's sakes!

193
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,630
Really?

194
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,797
Really.

195
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,799
It's always been you, Rach.

196
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,697
Oh, God.

197
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,941
Oh, this is good.

198
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,210
- This is really good.
- I know. I know.

199
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,010
It's almost...

200
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,722
What do you say we take a walk?
Just us. Not them.

201
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,558
- Let me get my coat.
- Okay. No, hey!

202
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,868
I'll get your coat.

203
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:28,610
He's going to get my coat.
He's going to get my coat, Joey!

204
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:32,975
Joey, I can't believe this!
This is unbelievable!

205
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,652
- What's that?
- What? Nothing!

206
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:41,190
- I saw my name. What is it?
- No, no, see? See?

207
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,223
It's printing!

208
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:44,525
It's printing!

209
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,861
Let me see!

210
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,692
Hey, someone order a coat?

211
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,234
Chandler wrote something about me
and won't let me see.

212
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,303
He won't? He won't!

213
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,867
Because isn't that...

214
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,204
...the short story you were writing?

215
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,441
Yes, it is a short story...

216
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,944
...that I was writing.

217
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,049
And I'm in it?
Let me read it.

218
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,252
No!

219
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:15,354
- Come on!
- Hey, why don't you read it to her?

220
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:26,730
All right.

221
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,946
"It was summer.

222
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,817
And it was hot.

223
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,480
Rachel was there.

224
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,985
A lonely gray couch.

225
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,162
'Oh, look! ' cried Ned.

226
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,934
And the kingdom was his forever.
The end!"

227
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,871
That's all you wrote?
You're the worst writer in the world!

228
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,770
This isn't funny anymore.

229
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,983
There's something about me
on that paper, and I want to see it.

230
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,308
No, you don't.

231
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,757
All right, fine. If you guys want
to be children, that's fine.

232
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,584
I do not need to see it!

233
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,164
What is this?

234
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:30,830
That is...

235
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:33,334
What is this?

236
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,199
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

237
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,978
Okay. Just remember how crazy
I am about you, okay?

238
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,337
"Kind of ditzy"?

239
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,680
"Too into her looks"?

240
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,053
"Spoiled"?

241
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:51,846
A little spoiled. He was supposed
to type "little," the idiot!

242
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,189
"Just a waitress"?

243
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,223
Now that was...

244
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,790
I mean, as opposed to...

245
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,666
Okay, is this over yet? Rach?

246
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,838
I do not have chubby ankles!

247
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,200
No! I

248
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,570
Okay, look at the other side.
Look at Julie's column.

249
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,913
"She's not Rachem"?

250
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,747
What the hell's a Rachem?

251
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,075
Is that a stupid paleontology word...

252
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,651
...I wouldn't know,
because I'm just a waitress?

253
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,723
Rach, come on!

254
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,757
It's "She's not Rachel"!

255
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,859
She's not...

256
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,236
My diary! Brilliant!

257
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:45,273
If I'd said it was my diary,
she wouldn't have made me read it.

258
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:50,039
That's true. You'd be a great person
to have around after an emergency.

259
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,881
I cannot believe Ross
even made this list.

260
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,553
- I know.
- What a dinkus!

261
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,951
Hey, cut him some slack.
It was Chandler's idea.

262
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,589
What?

263
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,296
Oh, good. I was hoping
that would come up.

264
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:07,930
This was your idea?

265
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,603
Let's get some perspective here.
These things happen for a reason.

266
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,465
Yeah. You!

267
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:20,105
Pheebs, back me up. You believe
in that karma crap, don't you?

268
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,144
By the way, good luck
in your next life as a dung beetle.

269
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,034
Rach!

270
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,337
Hey! Open up! Please?

271
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:52,609
When somebody does not buzz you in,
Ross, that means, "Go away."

272
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,006
It doesn't mean,
"Climb up the fire escape."

273
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,839
I just want to read you
your "Pro List."

274
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:59,477
Not interested.

275
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:04,684
"Number one:
The way you cry at game shows.

276
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,682
Number two:
How much you love your friends.

277
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,920
Number three: The way you play
with your hair when you're nervous.

278
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:17,032
Number four: How brave you are
for starting your life over.

279
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:20,362
Number five:
How great you are with Ben.

280
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,300
Number six: The way you smell."

281
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:26,635
What are you doing?

282
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,703
You want to open the window?

283
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:29,844
Oh, yeah.

284
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,881
- What are you doing out there?
- I'm...

285
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,620
You must be freezing.
You know what you need?

286
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,949
How about a nice, steaming
cup of hot Macholate?

287
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,288
Come on, open up.

288
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:49,600
Rach, come on.
You gotta give me another chance.

289
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:50,831
No.

290
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,996
- No?
- That's what I said.

291
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,263
Maybe we should go.

292
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,599
You don't have to go.
We're done.

293
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,366
I know how you must

294
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,272
No! You don't, Ross.

295
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:05,747
Imagine the worst things
you think about yourself.

296
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:10,215
How would you feel if the person
you trusted most in the world...

297
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,083
...not only thinks them too...

298
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:16,259
...but actually uses them
as reasons not to be with you.

299
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:20,931
No, but see, I want to be with you
in spite of all those things.

300
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,460
Well, that's mighty big of you.

301
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:25,599
I said, don't go!

302
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,703
You know what?

303
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:35,710
If it were the other way around, there
is nothing you could put on a list...

304
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,575
...that would make me
not want to be with you.

305
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,512
Well, then I guess that's
the difference between us.

306
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,188
See, I'd never make a list.

307
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:05,467
I never know how long to wait
in this situation before you can talk.

308
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,977
Maybe a little longer.

309
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:17,612
In these recipes,
the quantities may seem unusual.

310
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,892
Like these coconut Macholate
holiday nut bars?

311
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:24,186
I've indicated four cups of coconut
and four cups of nuts...

312
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,489
...and only one tablespoon
of Macholate.

313
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,459
Doesn't matter.

314
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,837
Our FDA approval didn't come through.

315
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:36,972
Something about laboratory rats.

316
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,166
Gosh, I'm sorry.

317
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,207
Yeah.

318
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,810
Anyhow, here's your check.

319
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,447
Thank you for all the trouble
you went through.

320
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:50,945
Listen, you didn't eat a lot of it
while you were cooking, did you?

321
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,623
Well, I ate some.

322
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,587
Oh, some is fine.
Some is not a lot.

323
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,930
So it doesn't burn
when you pee, does it?

324
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,145
Is that him again?

325
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:23,113
Tell him I'd come to the phone,
but my ankles are weighing me down.

326
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,883
I don't think this is the best time.

327
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:31,026
Look, can you do something for me?

328
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,627
Sure. What?

329
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:37,669
All right.

330
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,331
Music?

331
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:43,939
Sure.

332
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:54,083
The next one's dedicated
to Rachel from Ross.

333
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,184
Rachel, he wants you to know
he's sorry for what he did...

334
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,186
...and he hopes you can forgive him.

335
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:04,995
See the stones set in your eyes

336
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:09,291
See the thorn twist in your side

337
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:13,464
I'll wait for you

338
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,910
Sleight of hand and twist of fate

339
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:27,177
On a bed of nails she makes me wait

340
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:31,786
And I'll wait without you

341
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:36,925
We've just gotten a call from Rachel
and she told us what Ross did.

342
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:40,130
It's pretty appalling.
And, Ross, if you're listening...

343
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:43,094
...I don't want to play
your song anymore.

344
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,672
Why don't we devote our time
to a couple that stands a chance?

345
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,377
Avery, Michelle's sorry
she hit you with her car...

346
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,808
...and she hopes you two
will work it out.

347
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,151
There's a room where

348
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,785
I can go

349
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:08,549
And tell my secrets to

350
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,296
In my room

351
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,928
In my room

352
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:32,847
Thanks for coming in again.

353
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,847
Not at all. I have no morals,
and I need the cash.

354
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,252
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.

355
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:42,585
Anyway, they're called Fish-tachios.

356
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,289
They taste exactly
like pistachios...

357
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,523
...but they're made
of reconstituted fish bits.

358
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,626
Here, try one.

359
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,865
- All right.
- You're not allergic to anything?

360
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:56,537
Cat hair.

361
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,174
Oh, sorry.
