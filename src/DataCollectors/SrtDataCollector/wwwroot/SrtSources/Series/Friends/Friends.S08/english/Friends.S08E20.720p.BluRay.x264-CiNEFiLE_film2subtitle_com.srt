So, what's the final head count
on my baby shower?

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,835
About 20. A couple people from work
who had something else to do.

4
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:16,004
Also, your sisters called,
neither can make it.

5

What? You mean they're not coming
to a social event...

6

...where there's no men and no booze?
That's shocking.

Well, I don't care.
As long as my mom's here.

- Oh, my God. Your mother.
- What, my mom's not gonna be here?

9
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:31,728
Well, given that we forgot to invite her...

10
00:00:31,895 --> 00:00:34,439
...it would be an awfully big coincidence
if she was.

Oh, give it a rest.

to my baby shower?

invitations a month ago.

[LAUGHS]

317
00:19:06,341 --> 00:19:11,597
You're just so funny. You're so funny.
What do I do?

318
00:19:11,972 --> 00:19:15,809
Nothing. You have apologized
to her like a million times.

319
00:19:15,976 --> 00:19:18,312
And she's been nothing
but terrible to you.

320
00:19:18,478 --> 00:19:20,439
And don't forget,
you just threw her daughter...

321
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:24,568
...a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower.

322
00:19:24,735 --> 00:19:29,823
- And she hasn't even thanked you for it.
- You know what? You're right.

323
00:19:30,073 --> 00:19:33,118
Yeah, I mean, if you wanna
say anything to her, I'd tell her off.

324
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:34,828
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

325
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:38,582
Okay, I will.

326
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,126
Mrs. Green?

327
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:42,836
Mrs. Green?

328
00:19:43,003 --> 00:19:45,922
It is rude to leave a party
without saying goodbye to the host.

329
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:48,508
And also, when someone
apologizes to you...

330
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:50,761
...the decent thing to do is to accept it.

331
00:19:50,927 --> 00:19:53,388
Because what I did to you,
it wasn't on purpose.

332
00:19:53,555 --> 00:19:57,225
But what you're doing to me now
is plain spiteful.

333
00:19:57,434 --> 00:19:58,769
- Spiteful?
MONICA: That's right.

334
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:02,898
Maybe it's time you took a good,
hard look in the mirror, young lady.

335
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:04,816
Old lady.

336
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:06,818
Lady.

337
00:20:07,027 --> 00:20:09,863
Wrap it up. Wrap it up. Wrap it up.

338
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:15,661
So whenever you're ready to apologize
to me, I will forgive you. Good day.

339
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,167
I can't feel my legs.

340
00:20:22,918 --> 00:20:25,837
You were fantastic.
I'm so proud of you.

341
00:20:26,463 --> 00:20:30,050
- Yeah? I'm proud of me too.
- You should be.

342
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,844
- Could you get me something to drink?
- You got it.

343
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:38,266
Mrs. Green? Okay, I'm really sorry.
I apologize. If you just-- Aah!

344
00:20:38,433 --> 00:20:39,851

345
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:43,939
MONICA [LISPING]:
Okay. I bit my tongue.

346
00:20:44,606 --> 00:20:47,943
But I'm still really sorry.

347
00:20:54,491 --> 00:20:56,576
- Okay, I'm ready.
- You sure?

348
00:20:56,743 --> 00:20:59,705
Yes. I've done my studying,
and I really know my stuff.

349
00:20:59,913 --> 00:21:02,082
All right, then.

350
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,378
Rachel Green, let's play Bamboozled.

351
00:21:07,003 --> 00:21:09,756
How do you test the temperature
of the baby's bathwater?

352
00:21:09,923 --> 00:21:12,050
- Uh, put your elbow in it.
- Excellent.

353
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:16,596
- How do you put a baby down for a nap?
- Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.

354
00:21:16,763 --> 00:21:17,848
That's correct.

355
00:21:18,056 --> 00:21:22,102
This is an audio question. What do you do
when a baby makes this sound:

356
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:25,021
[MIMICS BABY CRYING]

357
00:21:27,065 --> 00:21:29,651
Uh, check if it's wet,
check if it's hungry, burp it.

358
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:34,781
Excellent. Now, do you want another
question or a Wicked Wango Card?

359
00:21:35,031 --> 00:21:38,452
- A card. A card. I pick a card.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

360
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:42,372
You've been Bamboozled.
You're gonna be a terrible mother.

361
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:48,462
I've lost sight of why
we're doing this.
