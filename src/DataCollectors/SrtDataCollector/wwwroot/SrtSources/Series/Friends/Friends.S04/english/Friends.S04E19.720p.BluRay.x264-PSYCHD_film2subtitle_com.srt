1
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:11,677
Morning's here

2
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,096
The morning's here

3
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,682
Sunshine is here

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,308
The sky is clear

5
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:22,271
The morning's here

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,772
Hey!

7
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:28,527
Do you have to do that?
It's Saturday!

8
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,529
Oh, come on!

9
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,448
Morning's here!

10
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:36,160
Morning's here

11
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,537
The morning's here

12
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,582
Sunshine is here

13
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,420
I hate this apartment!

14
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:52,092
I hate the color of these walls!
I hate that this place still smells like bird!

15
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,013
I hate that singing guy!

16
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,600
Are you kidding? I love that guy!

17
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:03,187
Morning's here, morning is...

18
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,147
Stop it!

19
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,566
I will kill you.

20
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,738
I hate that my room is so small.

21
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,616
I have all the space I need.
Just do what I did.

22
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:19,661
Monica, you don't even have a bed.
You sleep in a ball on the floor!

23
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,749
You know what?
I am tired of your bellyaching.

24
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,252
I've worked really hard at making this
a nice place for us to live.

25
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,713
I know. I'm so sorry.

26
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,757
I'm sorry, okay?

27
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,258
This is a great apartment.

28
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,344
Shut up. This place is a hole.

29
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:34,153
Oh, blimey, I still can't believe
you've got an earring!

30
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,406
I know, I know.
Who am I? David Bowie?

31
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,826
He does that?

32
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,078
- I don't know. Whatever.
- Ha, ha.

33
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,290
Well, I think it makes you look
really dangerous.

34
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,750
- Oh, I know.
- Ha-ha-ha.

35
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,544
You know what?

36
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,547
I never would've gotten this
if it weren't for you.

37
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,259
No, really. When I'm with you, I'm like...

38
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,179
...this whole other guy.
I love that guy!

39
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,514
I mean, I love you too. A lot.

40
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,933
But that guy!

41
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,518
I love that guy!

42
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,520
- I love both of you.
- Ah, heh.

43
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,692
I wish I didn't have to go.

44
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,777
Then don't.

45
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,655
Stay here. Don't go so soon to London.

46
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,199
- Just one more day.
- Oh, Ross.

47
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,618
- One more day.
- Please don't do this to me again.

48
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:27,497
You know I'd stay, but I've already missed
so much work. They'll fire me.

49
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,876
So? Then you could stay
as long as you want.

50
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,295
I wish I could.

51
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:37,466
Oh, no, don't... Don't...
Don't start packing.

52
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,426
Come on.

53
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,972
I don't think you understand packing.

54
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,101
I don't want to leave it
till the last minute.

55
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,896
Last time I packed in a rush,
I left my knickers here.

56
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,982
Yeah, I know. I, uh, tried them on.

57
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,026
You didn't!

58
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,737
No, I didn't.
I didn't want to be "that guy."

59
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,456
Hello.

60
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,292
Ho, ho, ho.

61
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,421
- Excuse me?
- Your pants.

62
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,840
Oh, yeah! You like them?

63
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:22,469
I went to a used-clothes store
and got maternity stuff.

64
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,514
These are so comfortable.

65
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,603
Uh, Pheebs, those are,
uh, Santa pants.

66
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,898
- What?
- Santa pants.

67
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,609
Santa Claus' pants.

68
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,446
Nuh-uh. They're maternity pants.

69
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,992
They even came with
a list of baby names. See?

70
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:48,245
These names are good,
and these are bad.

71
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,748
Oh.

72
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,584
- Hey!
- Hey.

73
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,044
Hey, Pheebs.

74
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,880
So, how are the elves?

75
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:04,386
I don't know.
How are the, uh, you know?

76
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,015
Your clothes aren't funny.

77
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,144
Hey, guys,
what should I wear to a Knicks game?

78
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,147
Uh, a T-shirt that says,
"I Don't Belong Here"?

79
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,483
You have tickets?

80
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:23,030
Mom got Dad's season tickets in
the divorce, so she gave them to me.

81
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,407
Apparently, they're good seats.

82
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,951
Oh, my God!
Those are almost on the floor!

83
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,828
Do you guys want these?

84
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,372
- Yeah!
- Yeah, we do!

85
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,291
Well, you got them!

86
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,668
- All right!
- Just give us our apartment back.

87
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,716
Whoa, I didn't see that coming.

88
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,635
Are you serious?

89
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:49,598
Come on. We know what these are worth.

90
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,850
Do you think we're stupid?

91
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,395
Not stupid. You're meaner
than I thought.

92
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,939
- What do you say?
- Forget it.

93
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:02,027
Okay? I'm not giving up my
bachelor pad for basketball seats.

94
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,613
Your "bachelor pad"?

95
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,782
Have you even had a girl here?

96
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,952
No.

97
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:15,207
But Joey has, and I usually
talk to them in the morning time.

98
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,169
Yeah, you do.

99
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,885
Come on!

100
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,222
Gunther, can I get
two cups of chino, please?

101
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,807
Good one.

102
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,684
Come on. Season tickets.

103
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,062
Season tickets!
You know what that means?

104
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,272
Forget it.
I'm not giving up the apartment.

105
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,193
When I was a kid, my dad's company
gave season tickets...

106
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:48,281
...to the Number 1 salesman every year.
All right? My dad never won.

107
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,619
Of course, he wasn't in sales.
But still, I never forgot that!

108
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,789
- Hey guys!
- Hey.

109
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,126
Oh, my God.

110
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,212
We don't make enough
fun of you already?

111
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,757
Oh, yeah. Emily convinced me to do it.

112
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,094
You do know that Wham broke up?

113
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,721
Ah! Ha, ha.

114
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,517
I like it. And Emily likes it.
And that's what counts.

115
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,729
So, uh, how are you guys doing?

116
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:23,316
Don't try and talk all normal
with that thing in your ear.

117
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,861
Where's Emily?

118
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,196
Ugh, she's saying goodbye
to her uncle.

119
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:32,075
- Didn't she, like, just get here?
- Yeah! Yeah.

120
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,410
Easy, tiger.

121
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,037
I just hate this so much.

122
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:40,125
Every time I go pick her up at
the airport, it's so great.

123
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:45,130
But I'm thinking, "I'll be right back
in a couple of days, dropping her off."

124
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,883
- So, what'll you do?
- There's nothing to do.

125
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,759
She lives there. I live here.

126
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,596
She'd have to move here.

127
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,473
She should move here.

128
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,475
What?

129
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,144
- I can ask her to live with me.
- Are you serious?

130
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,564
- Why not? I mean, why not?
- You've only known her six weeks!

131
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,776
I've got a carton of milk in my fridge
I've had a longer relationship with.

132
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:11,031
Look, guys, when I'm with her,
it's like...

133
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,035
Uh, she brings out this great side of me.

134
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,621
I mean, I love her, you know?

135
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,748
And I love the milk!

136
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,877
But I won't ask some British girl
to move in with me.

137
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,800
Joey, you say things now.

138
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,804
Look, Ross. He's right.
Emily's great.

139
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,264
She's great!

140
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,184
But this is too soon.
You're only gonna scare her.

141
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,520
- I don't wanna do that.
- No.

142
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,814
You don't want to wreck it.
Don't go too fast.

143
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,651
No. You're right.
I know, you're right.

144
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,653
I'm not going to do it.

145
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,365
- Thanks guys.
- No problem.

146
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,825
Just remember to wake us up
before you go-go.

147
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,923
It's too hard. Too hard!

148
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,677
All right, boys.
Last chance for the tickets.

149
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:17,430
Otherwise, I give them to my
new boyfriend, Joshua.

150
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,642
No, thank you.

151
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:24,229
Wait, wait. Come on, come on!
Let's trade.

152
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,856
The timing's perfect!
I just clogged the toilet!

153
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,030
I want those seats as much as you.
But we can't live in the small apartment...

154
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,117
...after we've lived here!
Ever read Flowers for Algernon?

155
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,994
Yes.

156
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,079
Ever read Sports Illustrated?

157
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,166
No, I didn't read yours!

158
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,918
We can go to the game tonight!

159
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,671
The only way I'll consider this...

160
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,132
...is if they offer more
than just season seats.

161
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,758
- It's the Knicks!
- Screw the Knicks.

162
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,552
Whoa!

163
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,601
I didn't mean that. I just meant...

164
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,770
...that the apartment is worth
so much more.

165
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,148
Huh.

166
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,984
And the Knicks rule all.

167
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,611
Yeah, the Knicks rule all!

168
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,947
Hey, so? Are you going to do it?

169
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,410
No, we're not going to
because it's not an even trade.

170
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,703
All right, look.

171
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,914
What if you could keep the apartment
and the tickets?

172
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,124
Done!

173
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:30,295
Let me finish. I'm talking about a bet.
Winner takes all.

174
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,713
Ooh, we could get nothing.

175
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,799
- Or you can end up with everything.
- Oh, I like that.

176
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,510
What do you say?

177
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,512
- No!
- Just do it!

178
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,306
Oh! Oh, I'm convinced!

179
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,645
Come on, man!
You know I'd do it for you.

180
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,147
Because you're my best friend.

181
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,568
All right. But you can't
use that again for a whole year.

182
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,445
I'm in.

183
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,574
This is so exciting!
What are you going to bet?

184
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,785
Okay. Well, we should
let Phoebe decide...

185
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:06,039
...because she's the only one
who's impartial, and she's so pretty.

186
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,167
Okay. Ha, ha. Um...

187
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,378
Ooh, ooh. Oh, I have a game!

188
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,172
- This is great!
- Okay. What's the game?

189
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,759
Um, well, it doesn't have a name.
No, okay. Phoebe Ball!

190
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,222
No, it doesn't have a name. Um...

191
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,474
Okay, Monica.

192
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:28,395
What is your favorite thing
about trees?

193
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,857
- They're green?
- Good! Good, five points!

194
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,239
All right, Joey...

195
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,324
Same question.

196
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,785
Uh...

197
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,871
- Oh! Heh. They're tall.
- Ooh, three points.

198
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,962
Both fine answers, but we were
looking for leafy. Leafy.

199
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,716
That's not even a game.

200
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,968
Shut up. We're winning!

201
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,347
You want to finish this?
We get a deck of cards.

202
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,224
High card wins.
What do you say?

203
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,309
- Let's do it!
- Oh, I have cards!

204
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,478
- Oh, good.
- Yeah. Here.

205
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,147
No, these are the trick deck.

206
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,649
Okay. Here, yes.

207
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,817
- Ahem.
- Okay.

208
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,402
Okay, you guys, uh, you pick first.

209
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,028
- Okay.
- Okay?

210
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,784
- Four.
- That's a low one!

211
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,327
Okay.

212
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,290
Phoebe, you look. I can't do it.

213
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,334
- What makes you think I can?
- That's okay.

214
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,502
Ace!

215
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,009
Why are you hugging?

216
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,927
Because we won our apartment back!

217
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,264
What? Ace is high!
Jack, queen, king, ace!

218
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,184
No! Ace is low!
Ace, two, three, four!

219
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,276
I don't know.

220
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,696
Ooh! Oh.

221
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,073
Look it! Aah!

222
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,245
- All right, come on, pick again!
- Okay, give me.

223
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,164
- Okay.
- Okay.

224
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,958
Come on, apartment!
Come on, apartment!

225
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,589
Aah! I know queen is high!

226
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,174
Not as high as...

227
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,802
It worked! King!

228
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,932
We pick again!
We pick again!

229
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,600
- Why?
- I don't know.

230
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,271
- Tickets, please.
- Ugh!

231
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,317
- That's courtside, baby!
- Yeah, ha, ha.

232
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,237
Seriously, good game, though.
Good game.

233
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:47,450
What are they so mad about?
They got the apartment back.

234
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,619
No, they didn't.

235
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,379
Hey.

236
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,006
Packed while you were gone.

237
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,634
I left some knickers under your pillow.

238
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,179
Move in with me.

239
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:09,889
What?

240
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:14,769
Don't be scared. It sounds crazy,
and people will say it's too soon...

241
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:19,816
...but just think.
Think how great it would be.

242
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,193
Oh...

243
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,987
I don't know.

244
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,699
Uh, oh, leaving London.

245
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,784
- My whole family lives there...
- I know.

246
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,912
- My job.
- You'll get a job here.

247
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,125
I always hear about them foreigners
stealing American jobs.

248
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,335
That could be you.

249
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,130
Yeah, but it's my whole life.

250
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,882
You come to England.

251
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,093
I can't. I would. I really would.
But my son is here.

252
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:51,264
I can't leave him.
You don't think there's any way?

253
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,267
Oh, I don't think so.

254
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,272
It would be different if it was
way into the future...

255
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,941
...and we were getting married
or something.

256
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,192
What?

257
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:07,155
Uh, no, right.
I shouldn't have said "married."

258
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,032
Uh, please don't go freaky on me.

259
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,619
I didn't mean it.
I didn't say it. I take it back.

260
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,120
No. Don't.

261
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,291
Why don't we?

262
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,501
Why don't we what?

263
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,005
Get married.

264
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,549
You are mad!

265
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:31,638
No, I'm not! It's perfect.
It's better than you moving here.

266
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,933
It's us together forever,
and that's what I want.

267
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,685
- We've known each other six weeks!
- Yeah, I know.

268
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,648
So what? Who's to say?
Does that mean we can't do it?

269
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:46,027
Look. I was with Carol for
four years before we got married...

270
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,447
...and I wound up divorced
from a pregnant lesbian.

271
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,409
I mean, this...

272
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,537
This makes sense for us.

273
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:02,335
Come on. Our first date, we ended up
spending the whole weekend in Vermont.

274
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,713
I mean, last night
I got my ear pierced. Me!

275
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,967
This feels right.

276
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:10,885
Doesn't it?

277
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,014
My parents are gonna be really mad.

278
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,976
Is that...? Are you saying "Yes"?
Is that "Yes"?

279
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,395
Yes.

280
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,607
- Yes!
- Yes?

281
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,943
- We're getting married!
- Oh, my God!

282
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,405
- Yes! Ha, ha.
- We're getting married!

283
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,240
Come here, come here.

284
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,747
Ow!

285
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,168
Emily, will you marry me?

286
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,255
Yes.

287
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,719
Oh, it's a bit small.

288
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,931
Damn! I thought that'd be
romantic as hell.

289
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,436
It was.

290
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,202
- Those were, like, the best seats ever.
- Oh, yeah.

291
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,956
Hey, should we give these to the girls?
Like a peace offering?

292
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,418
That's very nice.
Plus, they were free and too small.

293
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,467
Oh, God.

294
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,516
Hey, you want a beer?

295
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,563
- Whoa!
- I know!

296
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,152
Open up! Open up! Open up!

297
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,572
We'll discuss it in the morning.

298
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,248
What the hell is going on?

299
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,919
We took our apartment back!

300
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,216
I had nothing to do with it.

301
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:20,306
Okay, it was my idea.
But I don't feel good about it.

302
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,517
Oh, oh!

303
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,105
We are switching back right now.

304
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,190
No, we're not. We're not leaving!

305
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,317
You'll have to. You both have jobs.

306
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:35,154
As soon as you do, we're switching back!
There's nothing you can do to stop us.

307
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,739
Right, Joe?

308
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:37,949
I don't know.

309
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,037
What?

310
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,957
I don't want to move again, with...

311
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,837
I don't care! This is our apartment
and they stole...

312
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,256
You stole!

313
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,551
Our apartment!
We won it fair and square. Twice!

314
00:18:56,718 --> 00:19:00,555
And I am getting it back right now!
I'm getting it back right now!

315
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,599
All right.

316
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:08,855
We figured you might respond
this way, so we have a backup offer.

317
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,066
Oh, no more offers.
You can't offer anything to us!

318
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:16,612
- Let us keep the apartment and...
- As a thank you...

319
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,410
...Rachel and I will kiss
for one minute.

320
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,625
- Totally worth it.
- That was one good minute.

321
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,711
- Good night.
- Good night.

322
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,427
- Men are such idiots.
- I know.

323
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:44,265
Can you believe something that stupid
actually got us our apartment back?

324
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,727
It's funny. If you had just done that
after the last contest...

325
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,104
...no one would have
had to move at all. Ha, ha.

326
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,985
- Let's pretend that's not true.
- Yeah.

327
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,448
Okay. Scarf's done.

328
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,495
- Come on. Come on, come on!
- Okay.

329
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,873
- Hey!
- Hey.

330
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,082
What's going on?

331
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,293
Ross has some big thing
to tell everyone.

332
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,878
Uh...

333
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,839
Well, okay. It's, uh... Ahem.

334
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,592
Emily and I, we decided to, uh...

335
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,594
...to get married.

336
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,806
- What?
- Oh, my God.

337
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,392
Oh, are you pregnant too?

338
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,938
No.

339
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:35,107
When did...? How did you...?

340
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:38,152
We just decided to go for it.

341
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,489
We know it's a bit hasty, but, uh...

342
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,824
...it just feels so right.

343
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,748
Um, I was just telling the guys...

344
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,000
Yeah, I heard.

345
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,634
I think it's great! Aah!
