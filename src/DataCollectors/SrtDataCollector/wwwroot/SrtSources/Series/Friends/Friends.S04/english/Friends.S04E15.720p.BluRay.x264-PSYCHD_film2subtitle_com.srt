1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,712
I'm can't believe
I'm getting my nails done.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,423
And you said it was gonna be fun.

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,800
Which it kind of is.

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:14,179
You said there were gonna be other guys.
There are no other guys.

5
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:18,851
- Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
- That's a mailman.

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,186
That's our mailman.

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,772
Hi, how are you?

8
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:32,031
Chandler, don't worry.
This doesn't make you any less of a guy.

9
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,033
That does.

10
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,703
What am I sitting on?

11
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:43,375
Heh. I'd hate to think what this woman
was scratching when this broke off.

12
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,961
- Know who used to have nails like that?
- No.

13
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:50,049
Oh, my God.

14
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:45,813
Joey, let me ask you a question.
This has been driving me crazy.

15
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,315
- What does this light switch do?
- Oh, nothing.

16
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,443
Didn't it drive you crazy
to not know what it did?

17
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,654
I know what it did. Nothing.

18
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,033
They wouldn't have put it there
if it didn't do something.

19
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,994
- How can you not care?
- Like this:

20
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,833
Well, here's another question for you.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,752
Do you know what that little silver knob
on the toilet does?

22
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,088
- Sure. It flushes it.
- Okay, good.

23
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:15,759
Now, since you know, when you come over,
would you mind actually using it?

24
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,763
- Hello.
- Hey. Aah!

25
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,852
- Oh, my God. Wow.
- Guess who we ran into today?

26
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,690
- Janice.
- Is this amazing?

27
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,026
- How have you been?
- Well, um, I'm divorced.

28
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,028
- Wow.
- Really?

29
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,489
Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony.

30
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,994
And there it is.

31
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,914
I just came up to say hi. Hi.

32
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,418
- You, sweetie, I'll see you later.
- Okay.

33
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,128
Mwah. I'll see you tonight.

34
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,754
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

35
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,340
- Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye.
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Oh.

36
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,134
I can't stand the woman.

37
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,972
What?
I thought you were crazy about her.

38
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,517
You know all those little annoying things
she did before we fell in love?

39
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,979
You know, like her voice and her laugh
and her personality?

40
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,690
Well, they're all back, you know.

41
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,610
And she's picked up like nine new ones.

42
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,821
So, what are you doing bringing her here?
There's people here.

43
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,284
Don't worry about it.
I'm taking care of it tonight.

44
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,579
You are not. You have never been able
to break up with her.

45
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,623
Well, I don't have to break up with her.

46
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,459
We're not involved.
I'm gonna do a preemptive strike.

47
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,587
I'm gonna end it with her before it starts.

48
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,256
My ass is, like, frozen.

49
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,469
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer
for 20 minutes.

50
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,390
I'm telling you.

51
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,525
I can't believe
you really walk alone here at night.

52
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,153
I mean,
you hear such stories about New York.

53
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,113
No, it's really not that bad.

54
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,366
I mean, I, for one, feel perfectly safe.

55
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:08,288
Help! Help! Help!

56
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,833
No, no, no, Ross.
Ross, these are friends of mine from home.

57
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,003
- Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
- Oh. Heh.

58
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,213
- Hi, mate.
- Hey.

59
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,631
- How are you, man?
- Ha, ha.

60
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,343
That was a good one, huh?
I was like, "Help! Help!"

61
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,011
So how are you?

62
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,639
I've been meaning to ring you
ever since I arrived...

63
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,350
...but, um, well, I've been rather busy.

64
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,979
You realize we have not seen each other
since the night of that U2 concert?

65
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,356
- Ah.
- Oh, my God, I think you're right.

66
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,943
Well, actually, the last time you and I
saw each other was the next morning.

67
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,320
Ha, ha. Oh, Liam.

68
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,490
Heh. Oh, Liam.

69
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,160
So, what, were you guys playing soccer
or something?

70
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,578
Or should I call it...

71
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,664
..."football"? Uh...

72
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,250
We were playing rugby.

73
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,795
In fact, we're playing a game tomorrow.
You're welcome to play too.

74
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,173
Ha, ha. Ross play rugby? I don't think so.

75
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,384
Heh. What?

76
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,011
What's so funny about that?

77
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,055
Well, I mean, you're American,
to start with.

78
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,057
You don't really have rugby here.

79
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:14,646
Heh. Well, we didn't have freedom here
until 1776 either, so...

80
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,566
So good, then.
We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2.

81
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,110
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

82
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,247
Oh, boy. I just love to sing.

83
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,790
Yes, I know that you do.

84
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,043
One of the reasons
people were complaining...

85
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,297
...was because most of the people had paid
to hear the actor sing "Old Man River."

86
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,132
Oh, look at us.

87
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,053
Who would've thought that Cupid
had a station at 14th Street Nails?

88
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,349
Okay, we have to talk.

89
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:55,562
I'm just getting out
of a very serious relationship.

90
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,607
I know.
And I'm just getting out of a marriage.

91
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,818
I mean, talk about meant to be.

92
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:06,323
Right. But I just think
this is happening too soon.

93
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,659
Oh, too soon, too schmoon.

94
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,288
Face it, honey,
I am not letting you get away this time.

95
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,249
- I hear you.
- Ha, ha.

96
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:23,298
But unfortunately, my company...

97
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,967
...is transferring me overseas.

98
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,888
Oh, no.

99
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,140
Where to?

100
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,685
- To Paris?
- No. No, not Paris.

101
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:39,773
To London? Oh. No, Rome?
Vienna? Ooh, ooh. Barcelona?

102
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,818
Okay, could you just stop talking
for a second?

103
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,321
Yemen.

104
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,536
That's right. Yes.
I'm being transferred to Yemen.

105
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,789
- When?
- I don't know exactly.

106
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:02,754
Well, I will just have to soak up
every ounce of Chandler Bing...

107
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,174
...until that moment comes.

108
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,137
But I do know it's sometime tomorrow.

109
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,143
- Done?
- Yep.

110
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,936
- Hey.
- Hey.

111
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,354
What's up?

112
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,523
This switch thing
has been driving me crazy.

113
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,025
So I turned it off
and checked every outlet.

114
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:28,280
Now, four don't work, which means one
of them has to be controlled by the switch.

115
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,033
So I plugged in things in all four outlets
that make noise.

116
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,744
That way, when I turn it on,
I just follow the noise...

117
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,746
...and find out which one it is.

118
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,292
I bet I stopped listening before you did.

119
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,212
You know,
you also could have used lamps...

120
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,881
...and then followed the light.

121
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:50,844
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay?

122
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,471
All right, so everybody ready?

123
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,223
Here we go.

124
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:01,396
There's something.
I hear something. Where is it?

125
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,742
It's coming from Joey.

126
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,663
Oh, my God. That's so freaky.
Turn him off.

127
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,545
With the set scrum in center field.

128
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,547
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

129
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:31,134
Could we put on the news?
I think it might be raining.

130
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,430
No, just hold on a sec.
I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN.

131
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,850
I don't know what the big deal is.
I'm man enough to play this sport.

132
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:43,021
Dude, you're not even man enough
to order the channel that carries the sport.

133
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,608
Hey there, Ross.

134
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,944
Hey.

135
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,612
Janice.

136
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:56,243
You know, uh,
you really didn't have to help me pack.

137
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,411
Oh. When you said
all you were gonna be doing...

138
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,914
...between now and the time you leave
is packing...

139
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,291
...you really didn't leave me much choice.

140
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,127
Well, I thought I did,
but I guess I did not.

141
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,966
- Hey. What's going on?
- Oh, I'm packing.

142
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,427
You know, I'm packing
because I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.

143
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,930
Thanks for telling me.

144
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,478
I'm only pretend-moving to Yemen, okay?
It's the only way I can get rid of her.

145
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,855
Oh. Good one.

146
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,735
And Yemen.
That actually sounds like a real country.

147
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,988
Hey, Chandler, come on.

148
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:36,491
I'm gonna show you how to roll
your underwear and stuff it in your shoes.

149
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:40,704
- It's a real space-saver.
- I do that because it makes me look taller.

150
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,041
Hey, Chandler. Come on.

151
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,293
Okay.

152
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,087
- Joey, trade lives with me.
- Nope.

153
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,842
Man, look at this.
Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play.

154
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,803
- Look how brutal this is.
- Hey, I can handle it, all right?

155
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,096
Oh, please, Ross.

156
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:02,309
You got hurt playing badminton
with my dad.

157
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:06,062
That's because your mom's dog
kept looking at me.

158
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,192
Okay, Ross, look, look, look.
Right here, it's called a "scrum," okay?

159
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,322
- It's kind of like a huddle.
- And is a hum kind of like a scruddle?

160
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,159
Ross, they're gonna kill you.

161
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,912
Why are you doing this, anyway?

162
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,625
Well, you should've seen the guy
that she used to go out with.

163
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,960
I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.

164
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,339
You're kidding. And he plays rugby?
That's so funny.

165
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,509
Oh, I see. You did that. All right.

166
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:42,557
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me
playing rugby with him was, like, hilarious.

167
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,268
So I'm gonna show her
how tough I really am.

168
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,191
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You're right.
You are a tough guy.

169
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,568
You're the toughest paleontologist
I know.

170
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,236
All right, come on.

171
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:58,740
Look, Ross can take care of himself.
It's not like he's Chandler.

172
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,575
Thanks.

173
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,702
Look, don't worry about me.

174
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,414
I'll just look real energetic
and stay away from the ball.

175
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,750
I'll be that guy, right outside the circle.

176
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:11,711
- Ooh.
- Oh!

177
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,214
Oh, jeez.

178
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,093
Oh. Well, maybe there was a dog
looking at him.

179
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,103
Okay, Ross, Ross, Ross.

180
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,606
You're gonna wanna stay away
from that guy and that guy and that one.

181
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,234
Dude, they're all huge.

182
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,778
They don't look any bigger than me.

183
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,780
That's because you're closer to you.

184
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,990
So you look bigger to you
from where you are.

185
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,036
I'm just gonna go and say hello
to the lads.

186
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,955
- All right.
- Okay.

187
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,376
Hi.

188
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,669
Oh.

189
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,005
I kind of liked it.

190
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,094
Okay, I know what I've gotta do.
I've gotta go Red Ross.

191
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,473
You know, Red Ross?

192
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,684
Totally don't know
what you're talking about.

193
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,979
That time that we were all waiting in line
for Dances With Wolves...

194
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,315
...and that one guy cut in front of us,
and I just lost it?

195
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,777
Huh? Screamed at him, turned all red.

196
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,404
Red Ross!

197
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,073
No.

198
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,492
You'll see.

199
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,328
Liam, do me a favor.

200
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,665
Tell the lads to go easy on Ross.
It's his first time.

201
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,584
You don't say?

202
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:41,092
- Thanks.
- Okay.

203
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,845
Good luck, babe.

204
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,389
Ross. Ross, come on, get in here.

205
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,351
Ross, come on.

206
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,525
Ross.

207
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,778
Ross, come on, get in the bloody scrum.

208
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,197
Ross, get in.

209
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,460
Joey!

210
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,925
Oh. You are not gonna believe it.
Joshua came in today, and guess what.

211
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,551
- He asked you out?
- No.

212
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:27,639
But I was showing him some cuff links,
and I felt his pulse.

213
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,518
Saucy.

214
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:36,231
- What are these?
- Oh. Electrical plans for the building.

215
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,109
Okay, okay, okay, should I be scared?

216
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:44,239
I know that switch has gotta do something.
So I went to City Hall and I got these.

217
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:47,200
All I had to do was pay $25
and wait in line for three hours.

218
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,829
Wow. If only more people knew.

219
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,678
You know, you really didn't have to take me
to the airport.

220
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,931
Oh, please. Every moment is precious.

221
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,226
Besides, somebody had to ride
in that other taxi with your luggage.

222
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,563
And your friends don't seem to care
very much that you're leaving.

223
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,065
Well, we're not really that close.

224
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,279
Okay. So I guess this is, uh,
you know, goodbye, then.

225
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,822
Oh, no, no.

226
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,992
It's not goodbye.
I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.

227
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,705
Okay, well,
I guess it's just "wait here," then.

228
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,085
Hi. I need a fake ticket to Yemen.

229
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,755
- One ticket to Yemen?
- Oh, no, no, no.

230
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,466
I just need a pretend ticket.

231
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,677
I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand.

232
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,847
What would you give to a kid
if he wanted a ticket to play with?

233
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,516
Are you traveling with a child?

234
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,436
No.

235
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,773
Oh. She's gonna think
that I'm handing you a credit card.

236
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:04,736
But what I'm really gonna do
is hand you a library card.

237
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:10,867
Uh, sir, a ticket to Yemen is $2100,
and we don't take library cards.

238
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,870
What's the matter? Is something wrong?

239
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,039
Do you have to stay?

240
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,709
American Express?

241
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,882
Ross!

242
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,178
- Oh.
- Ah.

243
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,723
I can't believe they're doing that to him.
I told them to go easy on him.

244
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,351
No offense, but sometimes it's hard
to understand you...

245
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,436
...you know, with the accent, so...

246
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,440
- That's just halftime. There's more of this.
- Oh.

247
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,650
- Hey.
- Hey.

248
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,193
Hey.

249
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:49,989
Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh?
That is one fun game.

250
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,951
- Right.
- Do me a favor? Grab me a bottle of water?

251
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,869
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

252
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,832
- I think I'm dying. I really do.
- Oh, poor baby.

253
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,793
Tell my son that I love him.

254
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:06,589
Oh, excellent.
Okay, gotta have some more fun.

255
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,508
Ross, they are killing you out there.

256
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,262
- That's not true.
- She's right. You have to stop.

257
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,599
What? No. No, I'm not stopping.
I'm Red Ross.

258
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,978
Dude, you go back out there,
you're gonna be Dead Ross.

259
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,398
I don't care. I am not quitting.
I am gonna finish this game.

260
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,567
All right. If you insist on doing this,
at least let me help you.

261
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:30,780
God, no. That is no place for a woman.
Those guys will grab anything.

262
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,241
That's not what I was saying.

263
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,619
I just might know a few things
that could help you inflict some pain.

264
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:40,164
- I like that.
- Yeah? Listen closely.

265
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,417
- Devon has got a weak ankle.
- Huh?

266
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,669
One swift kick and he'll back off.

267
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,587
All right, bad ankle. Got it.

268
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,673
- And that big bloke with the beard?
- Uh-huh.

269
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,591
- He's got a trick hip.
- Ha, ha.

270
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,637
Yeah. And David over there,
I heard that he doesn't wear a cup.

271
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:58,057
Real...? I could use that.
Trick hip, no cup. Okay, okay.

272
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,810
And Liam. Liam's got bad knees.

273
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,187
You hit him right
and he'll go down like a lamp.

274
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,064
But Liam's on my team.

275
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,276
- I don't care. You just get him.
- Go get him.

276
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,487
Okay. I am going back in.

277
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:17,326
Red Ross. Yeah.

278
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,123
- Hi.
- Hi.

279
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,587
What are these?

280
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:31,132
Oh, just some pictures I made
and hung up.

281
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,510
I thought they'd brighten up the place.
They do, don't you think?

282
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,182
- Aah!
- No, no, don't, don't.

283
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,350
Oh!

284
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:46,647
I know that there's no hole there.
I just really like that picture.

285
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,694
Oh, my God. Look at this.

286
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:55,323
But there is a wire back there.
That switch is connected to something.

287
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:59,410
I don't care.
The wires have come loose in your head.

288
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,914
I thought if I could follow the wire,
I could find out what it did.

289
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,000
- And did you?
- No.

290
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,544
It disappears
back behind that baseboard.

291
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,672
For a minute there,
I thought it went downstairs.

292
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,179
But it didn't.

293
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,767
- Say hello to Mrs. Catrokis.
- Oh, my God.

294
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,813
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Mrs. Catrokis.

295
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,611
Are you sure
you don't wanna go see a doctor?

296
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,948
Oh, no, that'll just bring me down.

297
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:41,244
This was great. I mean, I was great.
This was a great day.

298
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,871
You know what?
I'm buying everyone coffee.

299
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,165
Someone just grab my wallet.
It's in my pocket.

300
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,500
- Yeah, sure.
- No, not you.

301
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,127
Okay.

302
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,880
Look, your eye's still popping out a little.
I'm gonna go get some ice.

303
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,633
- Okay.
- Ooh, ice, yeah. I'm so in the mood for ice.

304
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,596
- You were amazing out there.
- Oh.

305
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,474
- I kind of was, wasn't I?
- Oh, my God.

306
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:07,812
I made a man twice my size cry.

307
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,859
I mean, I haven't done that since I was 4
and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.

308
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,821
You really enjoyed yourself, didn't you?

309
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,740
Please, are you kidding?
I hurt three huge men.

310
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,742
I gave a guy a bloody nose.

311
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,495
I mean, I'm not proud of it...

312
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,497
...but I really am.

313
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,917
And it's all because of you.

314
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:34,839
- Yeah. Wonderful, amazing you.
- I think you've got a concussion.

315
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,592
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.

316
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,803
You're welcome.

317
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:46,142
- I'm sorry. Did that hurt you?
- It's worth the pain.

318
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,021
You know what?
You know what? It's not.

319
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,780
This is the final
boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.

320
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,452
Well, I guess I gotta go.

321
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,580
Oh. My Bing-a-ling.

322
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,833
I'll wait for you.

323
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,127
Do you even know
how long you're gonna be gone?

324
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:19,508
Well, just until we find an energy source
to replace fuel.

325
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,846
Oh. Well, I'll write you every day.

326
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,141
15 Yemen Road, Yemen.

327
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,062
Okay. Goodbye.

328
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,813
Goodbye.

329
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,328
- Chandler?
- No.

330
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,288
Chandler.

331
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,667
Janice. There you are. There you are.
I had to have one last kiss.

332
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,504
And also, also, you said you were
gonna leave right after I got on the plane.

333
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:00,883
No. No. I wanna see you take off.

334
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,053
Well, then I guess I'm going to Yemen.

335
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,182
I'm going to Yemen.

336
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,895
When we get to Yemen,
can I stay with you?

337
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,947
All right.
The super couldn't figure out what it did.

338
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:27,159
The $200-an-hour electrician
couldn't figure out what it did.

339
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,538
I've had seven pretty serious shocks.

340
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,417
- I officially give up.
- Thank God.

341
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,378
I guess Joey was right.

342
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,839
It does nothing.

343
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,304
See?

344
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:54,061
I'm doing it. I am totally doing it.

345
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,737
I lost it.
