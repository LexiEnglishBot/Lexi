1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:04,545
Hey.

2
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:06,171
Good morning, tiger.

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:10,467
I'm making you a big breakfast, so you
can keep up your strength for tonight.

4
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:13,345
You're gonna get me
good and pregnant.

5
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,391
I've got nowhere to go this morning.
I'm unemployed.

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,643
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with my life.

7
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,646
Well, I just lost my erection.

8
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,858
No, I mean, what am I supposed
to do with myself?

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,277
You're supposed to find
your passion in life.

10
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,405
You can be whatever you want
to be now. It's exciting.

11
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,658
Yeah, but it's all so overwhelming.
I don't know where to start.

12
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,703
Hey, wait a second.
I can help you with this.

13
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,915
You just need to be organized. We can
make a list of your qualifications...

14
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:48,005
...and categorize jobs by industry.
There could be folders and files...

15
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:52,885
Hey, this is where your hyper-organized
pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off.

16
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,762
I know!

17
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,723
My erection is back!

18
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,639
Thank you.

19
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:42,017
Ooh, Joey, could I have a sip
of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?

20
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,520
- Okay.
- Thank you.

21
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,237
Thank you.

22
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:58,450
Uh, Pheebs, have you ever been bitten
by a hungry Italian?

23
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,371
I'm sorry.
It's just, I'm a little short on cash.

24
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,706
Oh, if you want,
I could loan you some money.

25
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,751
Oh, no, no, no. I learned never to
borrow money from friends.

26
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,839
No. That's why Richard Dreyfuss
and I don't speak anymore.

27
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:16,385
Ooh, hey, how about this?
Wanna be an extra on my show?

28
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,011
- You could do that?
- Yeah, yeah.

29
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:21,431
The pay's pretty good, and you
could do it for as long as you need.

30
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,935
- Oh, my God. I'm gonna be on TV!
- Okay, now...

31
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:28,981
I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't
as glamorous and exciting as you think.

32
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,651
- Oh, really?
- No, it is awesome.

33
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,236
Hey, guys.

34
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,988
- Hey.
- Hi.

35
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,281
Oh, wow.

36
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,949
Hey, why are you all dressed up?

37
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:43,662
We're bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren
today to introduce her to everyone.

38
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,956
- Doesn't she look cute?
- She sure does.

39
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,709
Why does she have a pink bow
taped to her head?

40
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,378
If one more person says,
"What a cute little boy"...

41
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,214
...I'm gonna whip them
with a car antenna.

42
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,342
I think she's gonna be
the hit of the office, huh?

43
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,847
Yeah, she's gonna be hotter than,
uh, peasant blouses and A-line skirts.

44
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,517
Can I get a blue bow?

45
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,356
Okay. I have looked through
a bunch of career guides...

46
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,775
...photocopied and highlighted
key passages...

47
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,905
...and put them into alphabetical folders,
so you can make an informed decision.

48
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,617
How long was I in there?

49
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,537
Okay, let's start with the A's.
Advertising.

50
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:29,625
Wait. Advertising, that's a great idea.

51
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,295
Well, don't you wanna
look through the rest?

52
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,008
I don't think I have to hear the rest.
Advertising makes perfect sense.

53
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,344
I'm sorry you had to waste all this time.

54
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:43,138
You call eight hours alone
with my label maker wasted time?

55
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,934
Ooh, now I'll get to use my shredder!

56
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,438
I mean, I could write slogans.
I mean, how hard could it be, right?

57
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,190
"Cheese.

58
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,777
It's milk that you chew."

59
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:04,451
"Crackers. Because your cheese
needs a buddy."

60
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:09,331
"A grape. Because who can get
a watermelon in your mouth?"

61
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,708
Oh, I got one.

62
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:16,088
"Socks. Because your family's feet
deserve the best."

63
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,798
Honey, leave it to the pros.

64
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,301
I actually know someone
in advertising.

65
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,388
I grew up with a guy who is
a vice president at a big agency.

66
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,140
Maybe I can get him to meet you.
Give me the phone.

67
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:32,646
"The phone. Bringing you closer
to people who have phones."

68
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,441
"Marriage. It's not for everybody."

69
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:44,324
That went well. Almost everybody
knew that she was a girl.

70
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,995
Yeah, after you punched that one guy
who got it wrong, word spread.

71
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,040
I'm just gonna go in my office
and pick up some stuff.

72
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,088
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

73
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,300
I'm the hell person
whose office this is.

74
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,635
Good one, Rach.

75
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,639
I'm Gavin Mitchell,
the person who's taking over your job.

76
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,057
Excuse me?

77
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,935
Oh, your baby's so cute.

78
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:16,356
But why would you put
a pink bow on a boy?

79
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,613
Hey, Joey. Look at me.

80
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,157
I'm a nurse.

81
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,658
- Yes, you are.
- Ha, ha.

82
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,994
I think it might be time
for my sponge bath.

83
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:33,081
Sorry, I'm just so used
to hitting on the extras.

84
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,793
- So are you excited about your scene?
- Yeah, but I'm a little nervous.

85
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:40,714
Oh, relax. Don't be. They'll probably
just make you stand in the background.

86
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,508
- Good.
- You. Here, come here. Here.

87
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,804
Take this tray, stand on this yellow
mark. You're gonna move on "action."

88
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:51,725
Walk over to the operating table, stop on
the blue mark and put the tray down.

89
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,518
Don't walk too fast.

90
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,104
But don't dawdle.

91
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,024
Okay. Now, what?

92
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,362
And, action!

93
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,160
- Cut! Cut.
- I'm sorry.

94
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,580
- I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.
- Yeah, well, don't be.

95
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,291
Okay, that helps.

96
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,045
And, action!

97
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,217
Cut!

98
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,053
Don't worry about it.
It usually takes me three takes too.

99
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,639
Ha-ha-ha. All right, eight.

100
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,185
And...

101
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,937
...action!

102
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,374
So do you have any other
questions about advertising?

103
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:01,002
No. No. But let me show you
what I can do.

104
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,297
"Bagels and doughnuts.

105
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:08,343
Round food for every mood."

106
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,305
Monica warned me you might do that.

107
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,768
I think we might have something
for you at the agency.

108
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,896
- Really? That's great.
- It's an unpaid internship.

109
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,736
That's funny. When you said "unpaid,"
it sounded like you said "unpaid."

110
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,322
Come on, now. Monica has a good job.

111
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,491
It's not like you have
a family to support.

112
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:35,579
Actually, we're trying. I don't think
Monica is gonna want to postpone it.

113
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,414
We're supposed to have sex tonight.

114
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,877
Actually, she's probably at home,
naked right now.

115
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,382
I tend to keep talking
till somebody stops me.

116
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,219
- I can picture her on the bed.
- Stop!

117
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,888
Okay.

118
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,184
Wait. What do you mean,
you're taking over my job?

119
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,437
Well, while you were on your
baby vacation, I was doing your job.

120
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,773
A vacation? My idea
of a vacation does not involve...

121
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:08,028
...something sucking on my nipples
until they are raw.

122
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:12,073
Clearly, you've never been
to Sandals Paradise Island.

123
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:19,372
All right. Don't get too comfortable
there, because I'm back in two weeks.

124
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,374
I want everything back the way it was.

125
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:25,045
I can't say I care too much for the way
you've rearranged my office.

126
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,048
I can't say I care too much
for that smell you've brought in.

127
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,341
Excuse me?

128
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,595
Uh, Rach, uh,
we have a code brown situation.

129
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,224
Honey, could you please
take care of it for me?

130
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,061
All right, but you're gonna
have to do one sometime.

131
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,273
Let me just get this straight.

132
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,777
So I go have a baby, and they send
some guy in to do my job?

133
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:52,113
Well, there was talk of shutting down
Ralph Lauren altogether.

134
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,908
Okay. Right.
You're very cheeky for a temp.

135
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,453
I'm not a temp. I was transferred here
from another department.

136
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:02,249
Oh, and what department was that?
The, uh, jerk department?

137
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,292
They didn't tell me
about your quick wit.

138
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,128
Well, did they mention that
I'm rubber and you're glue?

139
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:12,133
- Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.
- Oh, hi, Mr. Zelner.

140
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,761
Ah, Rachel. I see you've met Gavin.

141
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,931
When you left us, we weren't sure
what we were gonna do.

142
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:22,018
But then, Gavin to the rescue.
Super Gavin. Ha-ha-ha.

143
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,604
Well, that's great.

144
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,649
So now, uh, Super Gavin,
when I come back...

145
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:31,319
...uh, where do you plan
on flying off to?

146
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,698
That's up to Mr. Zelner.
I'm sure he'll make the right decision.

147
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:38,201
Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.

148
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,580
Incidentally,
when, uh, are you coming back?

149
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,165
Uh, today.

150
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:48,420
- You said two weeks.
- No, I said today.

151
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,673
See, for a superhero,
not so much with the listening.

152
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,803
- Hey.
- Hey.

153
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,013
So, what'd he say?

154
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,347
Uh...

155
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,683
He can be a little rough
around the edges...

156
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:06,855
...so I'm gonna replace a word
he used a lot with the word "puppy."

157
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:13,403
Okay? So he said, "If your puppy friend
doesn't get her puppy act together...

158
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,698
...I am gonna fire
her mother-puppy ass."

159
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,577
I'm sorry. I can't do this.
I'm just not an actor.

160
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,163
That's right. You're not. You're a nurse.

161
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,832
- You're Nurse With Tray.
- Joey...

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,002
Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey.
She has no time for friends.

163
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,714
She gets in that operating room
and she carries that tray to the doctor...

164
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,050
...because if she doesn't, people die.

165
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,843
Who dies?

166
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,928
Man With Eye Patch!

167
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,556
Now, you get in there,
and you do your job.

168
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,849
- Yes, doctor.
- Okay.

169
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,646
Okay, let's try this one more time.

170
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:51,650
Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch.
Your tray is coming.

171
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,905
And, action.

172
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,204
Yes, I did it! I nailed it!

173
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,413
Whoo!

174
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,665
What's next?

175
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,250
The rest of the scene.

176
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,879
Okay, from the top, people.

177
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,139
Listen, sudden change of plans.
Um, my maternity leave just ended.

178
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,059
They said if I didn't
come back today, they'd fire me.

179
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,186
What? No, that's illegal.

180
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,980
I'll have the Labor Department
here so fast, they won't...

181
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:36,903
All right, calm down, Norma Rae.
They didn't actually say that.

182
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:41,157
I'm just afraid if I don't come back now,
this guy will try and squeeze me out.

183
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:44,703
But what about Emma?
I mean, we don't have a nanny.

184
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,914
I know. We're just gonna have
to figure out a plan tonight.

185
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,542
Can you please just take care
of her for today?

186
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,546
Absolutely. Just give me your breasts,
and we'll be on our way.

187
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,591
Come on.
I don't know what else to do.

188
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,178
- Fine. Fine.
- Okay.

189
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:06,599
We'll have fun, won't we?
Yes, we will. Yes, we...

190
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,523
- Ross.
- Huh?

191
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,568
You're pretty.

192
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,578
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be
starting a new career from scratch.

193
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,706
It's gonna be a while
before I make a living at it.

194
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:34,419
Maybe now's not the right time
to be starting a family.

195
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,673
So you have to tell Monica you don't
want to have a baby right now?

196
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,383
Yeah.

197
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,678
Goodbye.

198
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,227
Okay, it's baby time. Pants off, Bing.

199
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,064
Didn't see you there, Geller.

200
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,027
Yeah, Ross is here, so...

201
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,780
Uh, yeah, uh-huh. Yeah.

202
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:05,283
Uh, and I was really hoping
that maybe I could hang out.

203
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:09,537
- Mm.
- What do you, uh, feel like doing?

204
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,041
Well, uh, we're gonna have sex.

205
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,294
I don't feel like having sex.

206
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,381
Uh, maybe, uh... I don't know.

207
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,092
Maybe we can
watch a movie or something.

208
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,594
Uh, let me put it this way:

209
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,472
We're having sex
whether you're here or not.

210
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,016
Pants off, Bing.

211
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,942
Now that I'm back, why don't you just
fill me in on what you've been up to?

212
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:43,071
Well, I've changed your screen saver
from that picture of *NSYNC.

213
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,031
Hey, they were popular when I left.

214
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,785
I'm working on this
big presentation for tomorrow.

215
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,579
I should be involved in that,
so get me up to speed.

216
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,624
That'll take weeks.
Let me take care of the presentation.

217
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,960
Oh, no. I see what you're
doing here, all right?

218
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:01,673
This is my job, buddy. I've had it for
five years, and I know how it works.

219
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,051
- So why don't you just catch me up?
- Fine.

220
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,639
Oh, God. You've totally messed
with the back support on my chair.

221
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,141
- How do you fix this?
- You've been here five years.

222
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,311
- You figure it out.
- Fine, I will.

223
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,987
All right, fill me in.

224
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,952
- Hey.
- Hey.

225
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,789
Do you have a blue tie that would go
with this? Emma spit up on mine.

226
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,667
Oh, yeah, but you have to give it back
if I get a job.

227
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,253
Of course, by that time,
ties will be obsolete...

228
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,714
...and we'll all be wearing
silver jumpsuits.

229
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,010
- Hey, good morning, lover.
- Hey.

230
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,805
I gotta say, after last night,
I'm a little weak in the knees.

231
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:58,646
Here's an idea. You walk into a room,
take a quick scan.

232
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,317
Sorry.

233
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:06,154
But I kind of have this feeling that
we may have made a baby last night.

234
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:11,034
Oh, God, I have to tell you something.

235
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,453
You're not pregnant.

236
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,204
What are you talking about?

237
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,666
Well, that thing that I have to do
to make a baby?

238
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,251
I faked it.

239
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,379
What? You faked it?

240
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,341
You know what?

241
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,303
I don't need a tie.

242
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,308
I mean, it's...
It's better open collar, you know?

243
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:39,687
It's, uh, ahem, it's more casual.

244
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,613
Joey. Listen, I can't do this.
It doesn't make any sense.

245
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,700
Yesterday I was a nurse,
and today I'm a waitress at a café?

246
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:56,371
Oh, sometimes we use the same extras
for different parts. It's okay.

247
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:01,167
Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very
memorable performance as the nurse.

248
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:05,922
And now, suddenly, I'm the waitress?
That's gonna confuse my fans.

249
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,132
Um, um...

250
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,678
Well, maybe you are a nurse...

251
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:15,473
...but you moonlight as a waitress.

252
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,101
Oh.

253
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,811
Uh-huh.

254
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,398
Because I'm a single mother
supporting my two children.

255
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,733
- Nice. Yeah.
- Yeah.

256
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,319
Okay. Wait a minute.

257
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:33,074
Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the
same hospital. Wouldn't I come say hi?

258
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:37,328
No. No, see, uh,
you and Drake are having a fight.

259
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,955
About what?

260
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,291
He slept with you
and then never called you.

261
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,212
And I just wanted a new daddy
for Davey and Becky.

262
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,422
Okay.

263
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,342
Okay. Okay, from the top.

264
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,679
And, action.

265
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,141
So I'm surprised you agreed
to have lunch with me.

266
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,768
I'm surprised too. But yet, here I am.

267
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,022
Cut! Cut!

268
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,315
What...? What are you doing?

269
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:10,695
I'm very angry at him because he slept
with me and never called me back.

270
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,905
- Me too.
- Me too!

271
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,284
Oh, calm down.
She means on the show.

272
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,245
We need some new extras
around here.

273
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,168
Wow. You're here already.

274
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:29,130
Yes. Emma and I came in a little early
to do research on the presentation.

275
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,633
Actually, I made a few changes.
I think I'm caught up on everything.

276
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,844
So ask me anything.

277
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:38,139
- How do you fix the chair?
- Ugh, except that!

278
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:43,644
Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We are all ready
for our presentation this afternoon.

279
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:48,566
- Good, because it's in 10 minutes.
- What? I can't do that. I have the baby.

280
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,985
Ross is not gonna pick her up
for an hour.

281
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,988
Then Gavin can give the presentation.
We have to do it now.

282
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:58,826
Ralph needs to leave early today.
He's going helicopter shopping. Heh.

283
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,081
Well, there you go, you win. You win.

284
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,042
You get to do the presentation.
You'll knock them dead.

285
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:10,213
No one will remember that I worked here,
and then Ralph will buy his helicopter...

286
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,092
...and Super Gavin will just fly
right alongside of him.

287
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,183
- You can do the presentation.
- No, I can't. I have a baby.

288
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,477
I'll watch her.

289
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,814
Why would you do that?

290
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:32,151
Because you worked really hard, and
it's your job. And you're a little crazy.

291
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,780
That's really nice.

292
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:39,909
I should tell you that crying women
make me very uncomfortable.

293
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,620
Well, you're not gonna like
what's coming.

294
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,751
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

295
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,545
God.

296
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,131
Thank you. Thank you.

297
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,883
Um.

298
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,718
Okay.

299
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,515
I'm really fine. Don't worry.
I'm great with children.

300
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,852
Okay.

301
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,112
Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you.

302
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,658
Please don't fire my friend.
Just let me talk to her.

303
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,619
- Okay, but this is her last chance.
- Thank you.

304
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,413
How about I do something for you?

305
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,875
Tomorrow, uh, I'll bring you a hat,
cover up the bald.

306
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,883
Hey, uh, listen, Pheebs.
I was just talking to the director...

307
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,886
...and he was thinking maybe
this time you don't hit Drake.

308
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,679
You just wait on the tables.

309
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,891
I can't do that. I'm an actor.
I have a process.

310
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,768
You're a masseuse.
You have a table with a hole in it.

311
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,565
Wait, I see what's happening here.
You're threatened.

312
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,900
What?

313
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:57,361
I'm so good in the scene
that I'm stealing focus from you.

314
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,823
Well, rise to the challenge, Tribbiani,
because I just raised the bar.

315
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,535
- Come join me up here.
- Ha-ha-ha.

316
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,750
Yeah, you can fire her, but I would
call security. She won't go easy.

317
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:16,589
You faked it?
You couldn't have faked it.

318
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:20,801
Yes, you can. You just make
the faces and the noises.

319
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,013
Guys can fake it?

320
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,600
Ugh, unbelievable.
The one thing that's ours.

321
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,064
Why would you fake it
when we're trying to have a baby?

322
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,942
Well, that's actually why.

323
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,111
Look, I'm starting
a whole new career now.

324
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,947
I'm not saying I don't want a baby.

325
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,950
I'm just saying maybe
we could wait a little while.

326
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,494
Like...? Like a month?

327
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,665
- Or a year?
- Really? You wanna wait a year?

328
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,834
It could be less than a year.
I mean, you've heard my stuff.

329
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:58,965
"Pants. Like shorts but longer."

330
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,428
It'll probably be more than a year.

331
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,473
Wow. I...

332
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:11,811
- I really wanna have a baby.
- Well, yeah, me too.

333
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,942
Look, I'll just get my old job back.

334
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,653
No, I want you to have
a job that you love...

335
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:24,365
...not statistical analysis
and data reconfiguration.

336
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,285
I quit, and you learn what I do?

337
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:34,041
I think there's never gonna be
a right time to have a baby.

338
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,460
Now you're unemployed,
and in a little while...

339
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,755
...you'll find a new job
that'll keep you really busy.

340
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,550
There's always gonna be
a reason not to do this...

341
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,887
...but I think once the baby comes,
we'll forget about all those reasons.

342
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,099
I guess.

343
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:53,185
I mean, it's always gonna be scary
when we have a baby.

344
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,813
It's gonna be really scary.

345
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,691
I mean, God, when we have a baby...

346
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:02,653
...there's gonna be so much
that we're not able to control.

347
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:07,199
I mean, the apartment's
gonna be a mess.

348
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,660
I won't have time to clean it.

349
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,331
What if the baby gets
into the ribbon drawer...

350
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,167
...and messes up all the ribbons?

351
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,627
What if there's no room
for a ribbon drawer...

352
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,255
...because the baby's stuff
takes up all the space?

353
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,591
Where will all the ribbons go?

354
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,261
Should we go make a baby
before you change your mind?

355
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,221
- Yes, please!
- Okay.

356
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:32,350
Oh, and I promise I will not
fake it this time.

357
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,770
Well, I wish I could say the same.
I'm a little shook up.

358
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,694
I know you botched
that operation on purpose.

359
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:48,074
I can't prove it yet, but when I do,
you'll be going to jail for murder.

360
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,909
I don't care if you are my brother.

361
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,912
I'm not your brother.

362
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,164
What about my children, Drake? Huh?

363
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,292
No! No! No!

364
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,753
No! No!

365
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,756
God!
