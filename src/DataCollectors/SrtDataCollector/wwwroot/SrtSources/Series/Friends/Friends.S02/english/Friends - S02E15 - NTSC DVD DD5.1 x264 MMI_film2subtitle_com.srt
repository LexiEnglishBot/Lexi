1
00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:03,193
All right, no peeking.

2
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:04,300
No peeking.

3
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:06,402
No peeking. No peeking!

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,473
All right, but you better be
wearing clothes when I open my eyes.

5
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,944
All right. Open your eyes!

6
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:22,786
Sweet mother of all
that is good and pure!

7
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,918
Days of our Lives
picked up my option!

8
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,591
- Congratulations!
- I know!

9
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,958
Now we can watch Green Acres
the way it was meant to be seen.

10
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:36,997
So which one is mine?

11
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,934
Whichever one you want, man.
Whichever one you want!

12
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:43,832
Not that one.

13
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,481
Oh, yes!

14
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:53,179
Oh, yeah! That's the stuff.

15
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,788
Do we dare?

16
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,088
We dare.

17
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:10,868
The One Where Ross
and Rachel... You Know

18
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:55,543
I can't believe two cows
made the ultimate sacrifice...

19
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,079
...so you could watch TV
with your feet up.

20
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:00,979
No, they were chair-shaped cows.

21
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,083
They never would have survived
in the wild.

22
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:08,789
This screen is amazing.
Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.

23
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,662
Rose Marie belongs on
a smaller screen, doesn't she?

24
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:16,833
Hi, you guys.

25
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,704
Hey, you.

26
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,671
How was your day?

27
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:30,381
You know, pretty much the usual.

28
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,380
Sun shining, birds chirping.

29
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,710
Really? Mine too.

30
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,978
Hey, cool! Mine too!

31
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,193
I gotta get to the museum.

32
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,957
So I'll see you tonight?

33
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,030
Bye, guys!

34
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:55,835
Tonight?

35
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:01,079
- What's tonight?
- Our first official date.

36
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,144
Our first date.

37
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,840
Hello?

38
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,079
Hi.

39
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,723
You're supposed to waitress for me?
My catering thing?

40
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,486
- Any of that trigger anything?
- Oh, God, Monica. I forgot!

41
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,253
This is our first date.

42
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,557
- Yes, but my mom got me this job.
- I can be a waitress!

43
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,929
Thank you, thank you.
See? Phoebe! Phoebe!

44
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:28,197
Really, Pheebs?
You'd have to be an actual waitress.

45
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:31,272
This can't be like your
"I can be a bear cub" thing.

46
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,235
I can be a waitress.
Okay, watch this.

47
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,675
Give me two number ones,
86 the bacon...

48
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,577
...one Adam and Eve on a raft
and wreck them!

49
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:54,957
It's James Bond!

50
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,172
- Sorry we're late.
- That's okay. Come on in.

51
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,403
Is Monica Geller coming?
I was told she was.

52
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,541
Dr. Burke, it's me.

53
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:06,574
Monica?

54
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,381
My God! You used to be so...

55
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,949
I mean, you've
You must have lost like...

56
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,016
You look great.

57
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,119
Thank you.

58
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,485
This is Phoebe.
She'll be helping me.

59
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,193
Nice to meet you.

60
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,098
- So how you been?
- Great. How have you been?

61
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,728
Obviously you know
Barbara and I split up...

62
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,939
...or you wouldn't do the head tilt.

63
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,505
The head tilt?

64
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,007
Since the divorce,
everybody asks how I am...

65
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,737
...with a sympathetic head tilt.
"How you doing? You okay?"

66
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,183
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,748
It's fine.
Believe me, I do it too.

68
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,855
I always answer with the
"I'm okay" head bob. "I'm okay."

69
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,288
"You're sure?"

70
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,391
"Yeah, I'm fine."

71
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,153
I gotta set up the music.
I got a new CD changer.

72
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:02,093
Of course, the divorce only left
me with four CDs to change.

73
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,068
That's too bad.

74
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,264
I'll survive.

75
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,136
Two larges, extra cheese on both.

76
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,212
But listen...

77
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,939
...don't ring the buzzer for 19.

78
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,776
Ring 20. Geller/Greene.

79
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,745
They'll let you in, okay?

80
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,387
If you buzz our door,
there's no tip for you.

81
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,695
Okay, thanks.

82
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,132
Pizza's on the way.
I told you we wouldn't have to get up.

83
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,469
What if we have to pee?

84
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,905
I'll cancel the sodas.

85
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,216
Get back out there.
It's your party!

86
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,454
But they're so dull!
They're all ophthalmologists.

87
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,384
You're an ophthalmologist.

88
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,888
Because my parents wanted me to be.
I wanted to be a sheriff.

89
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:06,231
That's funny.
Cadillac, cataract. I get it.

90
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,490
But you stay out there!

91
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,397
- You see?
- I tell you what.

92
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:16,438
I'll come get you in five minutes
with some sort of kebob emergency.

93
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:18,944
Better.

94
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,203
Oh, God, here we go.

95
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,312
Hey, want to see them go nuts?

96
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,115
Watch this.

97
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,677
Who needs glasses?

98
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,856
You are so smitten.

99
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:37,926
I am not!

100
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,096
Oh, you are so much
the smitten kitten.

101
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,898
- You should ask him out.
- Dr. Burke?

102
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,997
I don't think so.
I mean, like, he's a grownup.

103
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,744
So? You two are
totally into each other.

104
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,438
He's a friend of my parents.
He's like 20 years older than me.

105
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,810
So you're never gonna see him again?

106
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,053
Not never.

107
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,950
I'm gonna see him tomorrow
at my eye appointment.

108
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:10,420
- Didn't you just get your eyes checked?
- Yeah, but you know...

109
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,459
...27 is...

110
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,956
...a dangerous eye age.

111
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:20,868
They are peeking teams to
play my discreption, help me.

112
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:30,312
I'm not saying it was a bad movie.
I'm just saying it was a little...

113
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,778
...hard to follow.

114
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,250
I told you there'd be subtitles.

115
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:35,486
I know.

116
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:40,659
I just didn't want to wear
my glasses on our first date.

117
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:49,957
Monica?

118
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:57,608
It would help when I'm kissing
if you didn't shout my sister's name.

119
00:07:58,544 --> 00:07:59,977
Honey, I'm just checking.

120
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,645
- Monica?
- Mon?

121
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:35,345
What?

122
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,573
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,944
It's just, when you moved
your hands down to my butt...

124
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,088
...it was, like, "Whoa!
Ross' hands are on my butt!"

125
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,656
And that's funny. Why?

126
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,586
Well, it's not.

127
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,128
I'm sorry.
I guess I'm just nervous.

128
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,335
I mean, it's you.

129
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,126
You know, it's us.

130
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:02,066
We're crossing that line.
It's sort of a big thing.

131
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:06,675
Well, I know it's big.
I just didn't know it was ha-ha big.

132
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,782
Okay, my hands were
nowhere near your butt.

133
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,692
I know, I know, I know!

134
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:26,023
I was thinking about when
they were there the last time.

135
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,857
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Okay, look! I promise.

136
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:32,070
I won't laugh anymore.
Put your hands back there.

137
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,566
No, see, now I can't.

138
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,203
- I feel self-conscious.
- Come on, touch my butt.

139
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,838
Just one cheek

140
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,046
The moment's gone.

141
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,480
- I'll back up into your hands.
- That's romantic.

142
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,550
- Touch it.
- No.

143
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,652
- Oh, come on, squeeze it.
- No!

144
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:51,822
Rub it?

145
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,720
Oh, come on!
Would you just grab my ass?

146
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,702
Wow! Look at that!
The car is on fire...

147
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,930
...yet somehow
its expensive paint job...

148
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,472
...is protected by the Miracle Wax.

149
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,711
You've got a Cheeto
on your face, man.

150
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,622
Aren't you supposed
to be out with Rachel?

151
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,194
That was 14 hours ago.

152
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:38,202
We gonna set a clock on this scene.

153
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,404
So how'd it go?

154
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:45,873
Have you ever been, you know,
fooling around with a girl...

155
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,140
...and she started laughing?

156
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:51,913
But it was 1982...

157
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,846
...and my Flock of Seagulls haircut
was tickling her chin.

158
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,752
She laughed at you?

159
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,763
It could be worse, could be naked.

160
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,005
I've been wanting this
since ninth grade typing.

161
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,241
And I just want it to be perfect...

162
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,439
...and right and...

163
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,507
Why isn't that laser beam
cutting through the paint?

164
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,342
- It's the Miracle Wax!
- It certainly is a miracle.

165
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:28,450
Hi, you guys.

166
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,322
Listen, I was thinking about...

167
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:34,957
Can you guys speak up?

168
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,288
It's harder for us to hear you
when you lower your voice.

169
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:52,334
I'm sorry about last night.
I really want to make it up to you.

170
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,336
There's no need to make it up

171
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:56,381
How?

172
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,985
Well, I was thinking
maybe a romantic dinner...

173
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:04,051
...with candles and wine.

174
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,728
And then maybe going
back to my place...

175
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,553
...for dessert.

176
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,498
That sounds...

177
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,028
...perfect?

178
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,106
What's this?

179
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,639
Would you get us a couple of beers?

180
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,553
I'm going to look into your eyes now.

181
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:36,845
Really?

182
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,888
That's my job.

183
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,556
All right.

184
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,056
Look up.

185
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,397
Look down.

186
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,156
Now, open your eyes and look down.

187
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,928
That's right.

188
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,000
Look into the light.

189
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,800
Now look at me.

190
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,152
Your eyes look good.
Those are good eyes.

191
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,616
Good. They feel good.

192
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,080
In my head.

193
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,258
- It was great to see you.
- You too.

194
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,164
You too.

195
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,198
Goodbye.

196
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,707
Drops!

197
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,503
Here, they're free.

198
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,474
Thanks.

199
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,748
I better be going.

200
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,683
Yeah, I'll see you later.

201
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,254
Thanks again.

202
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,201
We have to get you lazy boys
out of these chairs.

203
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:10,882
You should go outside and be with
the three-dimensional people.

204
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,849
No. Inside good.

205
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,519
Outside bad.

206
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,449
You guys are so pathetic.

207
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,193
Oh, Xanadu!

208
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,395
She's one of us now.

209
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,566
We just wanted to stop by
and say good night.

210
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,173
Good night.

211
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,075
They won't even turn their heads.

212
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:43,213
All right, you guys.
I'm taking off my shirt.

213
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,850
She's lying.

214
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:56,527
Stop sending food to our apartment!

215
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,394
Why are you dressed up?

216
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,463
You're not the only one
with a date.

217
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,167
- What? You have a date? Who with?
- No one.

218
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,768
Come on, what's his name?

219
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,103
Nothing.

220
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,237
Come on, tell me.

221
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,740
All right, but I'm very excited
about this, okay?

222
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,981
So promise you won't get
big-brothery and judgmental.

223
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,544
I promise. What?

224
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:20,216
- It's Richard Burke.
- Who's Richard Burke?

225
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,783
Dr. Burke?

226
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:26,183
You have a date with Dr. Burke?
Why? Why? Why...

227
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,892
...should that bother me?

228
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,924
I love that man.
He's like a...

229
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,427
...a brother to Dad.

230
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,164
- Here we go. - I know, I think
it's great that he looks like 50.

231
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:45,466
It's insperation to a man almost
retired all over the world.

232
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:51,214
He is the brightest, most sophisticated,
sexiest man I've ever been with.

233
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:52,609
Dr. Burke is sexy?

234
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,547
Oh, God! Absolutely!

235
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,320
Damn!

236
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,983
It's the museum again.
Can I?

237
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,928
- Dr. Burke kissed me once.
- When?

238
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:09,294
When I was 7, I crashed my bike
right out in front of his house...

239
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:13,198
...and to stop me from crying,
he kissed me right here.

240
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,507
- Oh, you are so lucky!
- I know.

241
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:20,508
Australopithecus isn't supposed
to be in that display.

242
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:26,817
No, Homo habilis was erect.
Australopithecus was never fully erect.

243
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,077
Well, maybe he was nervous.

244
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,661
Oh, look!
I can't believe this!

245
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:43,060
Homo habilis can't use tools yet,
and they've got him with clay pots?

246
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,860
Why don't they just
give him a microwave?

247
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,841
Clearly, they don't
have a place to plug in.

248
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,873
I'm sorry this is taking so long.

249
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,119
It's longer than I expected.
We will have dinner.

250
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,318
That's okay.

251
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:03,987
Karl!

252
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,849
Oh, God.

253
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,300
- Wow! Is that Michelle?
- Yep.

254
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,143
I've not seen her since
high-school graduation.

255
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,379
Oh, my God, that night
she got so dru

256
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,078
Emotional.

257
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,819
You know, she's having another baby.

258
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,991
- I thought she just had one.
- No, no. Henry's almost 2.

259
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:43,726
And he's talking
and everything. Here.

260
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,330
The other day he told me he liked me
better than his other grandpa.

261
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,899
In all fairness, his other
grandpa's a drunk, but still...

262
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,467
You're a grandpa.

263
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,679
Are we nuts here?

264
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,652
I don't know. Maybe.

265
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:14,986
I mean, I'm dating a man
whose pool I once peed in.

266
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,528
I didn't need to know that.

267
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,096
I guess 21 years is a lot.

268
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:26,297
I mean, hell, I'm a whole person
who can drink older than you.

269
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:39,214
So maybe we should just...

270
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,085
Maybe...

271
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,358
Wow.

272
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,390
This really sucks.

273
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,028
Yeah, it sure does.

274
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,914
We don't really have to decide
anything right now, do we?

275
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,815
No, there's no rush or anything.

276
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,394
- Pizza delivery!
- Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys!

277
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,498
I'm done.

278
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,304
Yeah, well, you know what?
So is Sorentino's.

279
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,969
I'm sorry.
Why don't we find someplace else?

280
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,643
It's late. Everything will be closed.
We'll do it another night.

281
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,244
No, no, we won't.

282
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,606
We won't?

283
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,710
Come on.

284
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,316
Okay, that's dead, right?

285
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,179
What are we doing?

286
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,927
- Do you want Cranapple or Cran-Grape?
- Grape.

287
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,764
Okay, now...

288
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,156
...sit.

289
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,131
Oh, my God!

290
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:12,642
Billions of years ago,
Earth was only

291
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,680
Sorry.

292
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,816
So what are we looking at?

293
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:27,554
Well, you see that little cluster
of stars next to the big one?

294
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,487
That is Ursa Major.

295
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,888
- Really?
- No idea. It could be.

296
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,636
Listen, I'm sorry
I had to work tonight.

297
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,835
Oh, that's okay.

298
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,936
You were worth the wait.

299
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,271
And I don't just mean tonight.

300
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,115
You're not laughing.

301
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,419
This time it's not so funny.

302
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,423
Oh, God!

303
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:38,287
Honey?

304
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,565
That's okay.

305
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,131
What?

306
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:46,136
Oh, no. You just rolled
over the juice box.

307
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,171
Thank God!

308
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,370
Hey, you.

309
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,550
I can't believe I'm waking up
next to you.

310
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,115
I know. It is pretty unbel

311
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,625
We're not alone.

312
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,558
Is that the fire alarm?

313
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,258
It's not warm yet.
We still have time.

314
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,101
- Cool.
- Yeah, yeah. Cool!
