1
00:00:02,965 --> 00:00:04,318
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:04,636 --> 00:00:06,854
I found a note on my door,
"Come to Monica's.

3
00:00:07,106 --> 00:00:10,131
Bring champagne
and a Three Musketeers bar."

4
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:11,870
Yeah, I'll take that.

5
00:00:12,673 --> 00:00:13,741
What's up?

6
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:17,400
- Monica and I are engaged.
- Oh, my God.

7
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:24,463
Congratulations. Where is she?

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,449
I'm engaged! I'm engaged!

9
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:31,624
She's been there for 20 minutes.
You didn't hear?

10
00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:34,617
I thought it was a kid yelling,
"I'm gay!"

11
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:38,378
No, that guy moved.

12
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,968
- Can I bring her in?
- Let her stay. It's sweet.

13
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,143
I'm getting married!
I'm gonna be a bride!

14
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:53,096
No, I will not shut up,
because I'm engaged!

15
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:57,342
Oh, big talk! Why don't you
come here and say that to me?

16
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,256
My fiancé will kick your ass.

17
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:04,924
Come on, apartment 20, apartment 20.

18
00:01:06,565 --> 00:01:09,827
You get her in, you bolt the door,
I'll be in the closet.

19
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:15,506
The One with Monica's Thunder

20
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,603
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

21
00:01:53,638 --> 00:01:58,122
I just want to say that I love
you guys so, so much...

22
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:01,666
...and thank you for being here
on my special night.

23
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,863
Our special night.

24
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:07,894
It just wouldn't be my night...
Our night...

25
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:12,001
...if you weren't here to celebrate
with me... Us. Damn it!

26
00:02:12,286 --> 00:02:15,655
It's okay,
I want this to be your night too.

27
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,537
To Monica.

28
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:19,656
Come on, wait, stop it.

29
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:21,185
Okay, to Monica.

30
00:02:23,907 --> 00:02:28,249
Have you decided on a band for the
wedding? Because I'm kind of musical.

31
00:02:29,126 --> 00:02:32,566
She got engaged a few hours ago,
I doubt she's had time to think...

32
00:02:32,814 --> 00:02:36,112
Speaking of chiming in, remember the
time you burned down my apartment?

33
00:02:37,893 --> 00:02:39,625
Yeah, you're on your own.

34
00:02:40,398 --> 00:02:44,039
We should get dressed up
and go have champagne at the Plaza.

35
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,692
I can't stay too long.

36
00:02:47,982 --> 00:02:51,351
I gotta get up early for an audition.
I gotta look good.

37
00:02:51,636 --> 00:02:54,233
I'm supposed to be playing
a 19-year-old.

38
00:02:56,472 --> 00:02:57,444
What?

39
00:02:57,724 --> 00:03:01,129
So when you said get up early,
did you mean 1986?

40
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:04,884
You guys don't think I look 19?

41
00:03:07,953 --> 00:03:10,349
Oh, 19! We thought you said 90.

42
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:16,094
Okay, everybody, let's go.

43
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:21,904
Is my candy bar around here?

44
00:03:22,148 --> 00:03:23,500
No, you ate it all.

45
00:03:23,748 --> 00:03:25,800
I was afraid of that.

46
00:03:33,873 --> 00:03:36,649
You know what shoes would look great
with this ring?

47
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:38,523
Diamond shoes.

48
00:03:40,935 --> 00:03:42,952
You're not getting dressed.

49
00:03:48,242 --> 00:03:49,629
Know what I mean?

50
00:03:51,825 --> 00:03:54,257
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.

51
00:03:54,504 --> 00:03:56,093
There's gonna be a wedding.

52
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:57,913
You're gonna be the bride.

53
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,321
200 people are gonna be looking at you
in a clean, white dress.

54
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:04,765
Let's do it.

55
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:14,014
So are you the fairest one of all?

56
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:17,976
- I can still play 19, right?
- Yeah, but you gotta dress younger.

57
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:20,806
If you wear the right clothes,
you can look any age.

58
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,960
- Really?
- Yeah. I work in fashion...

59
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,082
...and fashion is all about youth.

60
00:04:25,886 --> 00:04:27,962
Fashion is about me?

61
00:04:28,148 --> 00:04:30,853
About youth. Youth!
Listen up, grandpa.

62
00:04:39,942 --> 00:04:42,789
Chandler, it happens to lots of guys.

63
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:46,899
You're tired,
you had a lot of champagne.

64
00:04:47,144 --> 00:04:49,018
Don't worry about it.

65
00:04:51,111 --> 00:04:54,444
I'm not worried. I'm fascinated.

66
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,893
You know? It's like biology.

67
00:04:58,138 --> 00:05:01,614
Which is funny, because in high school
I failed biology...

68
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:04,671
...and tonight biology failed me.

69
00:05:06,732 --> 00:05:10,801
Check it out. I could play this
while the guests are coming in. Okay.

70
00:05:12,473 --> 00:05:16,779
Twelve years old and addicted to pork

71
00:05:16,996 --> 00:05:19,950
No one thought Monica would marry

72
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:25,168
She knew her way
Around a knife and a fork

73
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,969
Phoebe, that's great, but...

74
00:05:27,225 --> 00:05:30,938
So you're not convinced. That's all
right because I got another one.

75
00:05:32,686 --> 00:05:37,622
First time I met Chandler
I thought he was gay

76
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:44,060
But here I am singing
On his wedding day

77
00:05:46,255 --> 00:05:47,679
Phoebe, no.

78
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:52,368
If you'd let me finish, it goes on
to say that he's probably not gay.

79
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:58,880
You guys don't have this problem,
you're made of wood.

80
00:06:02,747 --> 00:06:04,443
Hey, you look great.

81
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,154
Thanks.

82
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:08,097
You okay over there?

83
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:12,592
I don't know. You know?
I feel a little...

84
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:17,809
You know what? Never mind.
I'll be fine.

85
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:22,846
Don't worry about it. You're probably
tired, you had a lot of champagne.

86
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,702
It happens to everybody.

87
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:34,021
- Happy Monica's Night.
- Well, thank you. You too.

88
00:06:34,372 --> 00:06:37,492
Can you believe
they are actually getting married?

89
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:40,737
Well, sure,
but I get married all the time.

90
00:06:44,114 --> 00:06:46,546
- You okay?
- Yeah, I guess.

91
00:06:48,463 --> 00:06:51,203
Do you think we'll ever have that?

92
00:06:52,394 --> 00:06:54,162
You mean "we," you and me?

93
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,774
Oh, no, no, no.

94
00:06:57,092 --> 00:06:59,274
"We," you with someone,
me with someone.

95
00:06:59,562 --> 00:07:01,186
Good, you scared me a minute.

96
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:03,243
I know. Shake it off.

97
00:07:04,294 --> 00:07:08,528
It's just because you and I,
we were like a nightmare.

98
00:07:10,695 --> 00:07:15,143
- No, but there were some good times.
- Absolutely. Like, there was...

99
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:21,198
- Surely you can think of something.
- Just give me a minute.

100
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,129
Oh, well, yes.

101
00:07:25,447 --> 00:07:28,258
I can think of one good thing.

102
00:07:32,057 --> 00:07:35,603
You were always good at the...

103
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,773
...stuff.

104
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:46,628
I was good at the stuff?

105
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:50,175
I really liked your hands.

106
00:07:50,462 --> 00:07:52,086
My hands?

107
00:07:55,402 --> 00:07:56,790
Way to go, guys.

108
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,236
You were really good at the stuff too.

109
00:08:01,526 --> 00:08:02,914
Oh, I know.

110
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,314
What are you thinking about?

111
00:08:09,563 --> 00:08:11,674
Just some stuff.

112
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:14,700
Hey, you know what we never did?

113
00:08:16,103 --> 00:08:17,134
Oh, no, not that.

114
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:20,515
We never had a bonus night.

115
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,260
- A what?
- You know, a bonus night.

116
00:08:22,471 --> 00:08:26,255
Two people break up, but they
get back together for one night.

117
00:08:26,854 --> 00:08:31,196
One night, just sex?
No strings attached?

118
00:08:31,446 --> 00:08:34,507
- Yeah, yeah, we never had that.
- No.

119
00:08:40,806 --> 00:08:43,866
Okay, this is getting a little crazy.

120
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,120
I'm sure it would be amazing...

121
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,625
...but I really don't think
it would be a good idea.

122
00:08:52,913 --> 00:08:54,573
I really...

123
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:57,077
...really...

124
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,304
...don't.

125
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,375
Well, at least I can
still do some things.

126
00:09:24,435 --> 00:09:25,573
'Sup?

127
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:30,661
'Sup, dude?

128
00:09:31,636 --> 00:09:34,209
Take whatever you want,
just don't hurt me.

129
00:09:36,472 --> 00:09:38,760
You playing
a little PlayStation, huh?

130
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,200
That's whack.

131
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:46,211
PlayStation is whack.

132
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:50,805
'Sup with the whack PlayStation,
'sup?

133
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:56,685
Come on, am I 19 or what?

134
00:09:57,034 --> 00:10:01,340
Yes, on a scale of one to ten, ten
being the dumbest a person can look...

135
00:10:01,661 --> 00:10:03,606
...you are definitely 19.

136
00:10:05,036 --> 00:10:06,625
Come on, really. How old?

137
00:10:06,846 --> 00:10:09,348
Young. You're a man-child, okay?

138
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:14,706
Now get changed, everybody's ready.
And please, please, keep my underwear.

139
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:17,098
Thanks.

140
00:10:27,547 --> 00:10:30,180
You've had a lot of sex, right?

141
00:10:33,357 --> 00:10:35,124
When, today?

142
00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:39,920
Some, not a lot.

143
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:45,069
The reason I'm asking
is because I had kind of a...

144
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,332
I was unable to...

145
00:10:47,795 --> 00:10:50,915
I really wanted to, but I couldn't...

146
00:10:52,457 --> 00:10:56,490
I cannot believe I'm asking advice
from somebody who's wearing that hat.

147
00:10:59,937 --> 00:11:01,882
I had an incident.

148
00:11:03,486 --> 00:11:06,511
Don't worry about that, man.
That happens.

149
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:10,297
- It's happened to you?
- Yeah, once.

150
00:11:10,862 --> 00:11:14,195
- Well, what'd you do?
- I did it anyway.

151
00:11:18,238 --> 00:11:20,871
Phoebe, come on, let's go.

152
00:11:21,404 --> 00:11:22,756
Come on.

153
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:26,307
Why aren't you dressed yet?

154
00:11:26,622 --> 00:11:29,089
I wrote the best song
for your wedding.

155
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:30,616
Check this out.

156
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,153
If you get ready now, you can play.

157
00:11:33,477 --> 00:11:34,449
- Really?!
- Yes.

158
00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:37,196
That's so exciting! Thanks, Mon.

159
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:42,102
But if you touch my guitar again,
I'll have to pound on you a little bit.

160
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:45,199
Fair enough. Get ready.
I'll get everybody.

161
00:11:45,514 --> 00:11:48,361
Finally we can start celebrating my...

162
00:11:52,195 --> 00:11:55,315
I'm sorry, apparently I opened
the door to the past.

163
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,222
Okay, Monica, Mon.
Okay, what you just saw...

164
00:12:03,536 --> 00:12:07,214
Can I ask you just a little question?
Why tonight?

165
00:12:08,582 --> 00:12:11,049
I waited my whole life
to be engaged...

166
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:14,589
...and unlike some,
I only plan on doing this once.

167
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:21,731
Maybe it's selfish, I'm sorry, but I
hoped tonight could just be about that.

168
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,709
But it is just about that.

169
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,356
Now it's about you
getting back together.

170
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:29,166
See, you kind of stole my thunder.

171
00:12:30,152 --> 00:12:34,007
We did not steal your thunder.
We are not getting back together.

172
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:37,518
Yeah, no, and you know what?
Nobody even saw.

173
00:12:39,094 --> 00:12:40,303
That's true.

174
00:12:41,251 --> 00:12:43,504
- We just kissed.
- It was just a kiss.

175
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,001
You guys kissed?!

176
00:12:47,095 --> 00:12:48,863
What does this mean?!

177
00:12:49,114 --> 00:12:52,068
Are you back together?
Can I sing at your wedding?

178
00:12:53,463 --> 00:12:55,337
Thunder being stolen.

179
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:59,097
- Phoebe, it's nothing.
- Let's not make a big deal of this.

180
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:02,223
It was a one-time thing.
It doesn't even matter.

181
00:13:02,543 --> 00:13:03,824
Oh, my God.

182
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,659
I cannot believe you guys
are talking about this.

183
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,757
Problems in the bedroom
are between a man and a woman.

184
00:13:13,677 --> 00:13:17,390
All right? Now, Chandler
is doing the best he can.

185
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,659
I don't think that's
what they were talking about.

186
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:27,174
No, but let's talk about it.

187
00:13:27,593 --> 00:13:30,713
What a great night.
Chandler can't do it, they kissed.

188
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:33,360
- What?
- You guys kissed? This is huge.

189
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:34,644
No, it's not huge.

190
00:13:34,969 --> 00:13:37,745
People thinking it's huge
has led Monica to believe...

191
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:40,213
...we're stealing her thunder,
which we aren't.

192
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,333
We're still talking about it.

193
00:13:42,624 --> 00:13:45,020
That and Chandler's problem.

194
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,249
Monica, listen, listen.

195
00:13:48,572 --> 00:13:52,155
Would you feel better if we stopped
talking about Ross and Rachel?

196
00:13:52,435 --> 00:13:54,308
- That would be lovely.
- You got it.

197
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:57,509
Now, I can pass for 19, right?

198
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,670
Yes, you can pass for 19.

199
00:13:59,915 --> 00:14:01,338
- Really?
- Yes.

200
00:14:01,863 --> 00:14:03,630
- Seriously?
- Seriously?

201
00:14:03,882 --> 00:14:08,817
Seriously, no. Okay? You can play
your own age, which is 31.

202
00:14:11,988 --> 00:14:13,577
I'm 30!

203
00:14:15,223 --> 00:14:17,240
Joey, you are not. You're 31.

204
00:14:18,737 --> 00:14:20,196
Oh, crap!

205
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:25,614
So the Plaza. We'll get some mai
tais? Maybe no more for you though.

206
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:31,914
You know, I think I don't feel like
going to the Plaza.

207
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:33,899
Monica, this is ridiculous.

208
00:14:34,393 --> 00:14:38,248
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't. Especially with you.

209
00:14:41,282 --> 00:14:42,812
That is whack.

210
00:14:56,382 --> 00:14:57,876
I'll play it at the wedding.

211
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:01,525
We'll see if they actually
let you play.

212
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:04,134
They tell you anything
you want to hear...

213
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:06,079
...like, "You look 19."

214
00:15:06,332 --> 00:15:09,938
Then they just take it away,
like, "No, you don't."

215
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:13,391
Monica won't take this away.

216
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:16,344
- Wouldn't she?
- Would she?

217
00:15:17,153 --> 00:15:18,540
Would she?

218
00:15:19,901 --> 00:15:21,561
Would she?

219
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,061
Would she?

220
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:26,122
It's starting
to sound like "wood cheese."

221
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:29,951
Man, I could go
for some wood cheese right now.

222
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:36,665
Guess who.

223
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:42,863
Hey, I just realized we kind of left
some stuff up in the air.

224
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:44,527
What did Monica mean:

225
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:46,888
"I don't want to talk,"
especially with me?

226
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:50,130
Why not especially you and me?
We were both kissing.

227
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:51,585
Still thinking about it?

228
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:55,279
I'm serious. What did she mean
by that? "Especially you."

229
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:57,438
- Who cares?
- I care.

230
00:15:57,719 --> 00:15:59,107
And so do I.

231
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:06,103
I have to talk to her.
Will you let me get changed?

232
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:11,737
Am I going to let you watch me?

233
00:16:11,985 --> 00:16:13,088
No.

234
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,476
I can't believe her.
It's just so typical.

235
00:16:17,794 --> 00:16:22,029
I know you're upset, but don't forget
there is going to be a wedding.

236
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:26,315
You are going to throw the bouquet,
and then a honeymoon.

237
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:30,000
- Maybe in Paris.
- Paris?

238
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:34,803
We will take a moonlit walk
on the Rue de la blah-blah-blah.

239
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:39,155
Keep talking.

240
00:16:39,435 --> 00:16:42,531
We will sprinkle rose petals
on the bed and make love...

241
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,974
...not just because it's romantic,
but because I can.

242
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:50,178
I love you.

243
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,779
Don't say anything,
you might scare it away.

244
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,762
It's Paris.
Who knows we're here?

245
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:14,079
Hi, Pheebs. What's up?

246
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:17,736
You said I could sing at your wedding,
so I need a small deposit.

247
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:22,531
You know, some good-faith money
to hold the date.

248
00:17:22,855 --> 00:17:25,002
We're not giving you a deposit
for our wedding.

249
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:27,965
Oh, I see.

250
00:17:29,987 --> 00:17:31,932
They break your heart, don't they?

251
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:36,069
You know, I don't really need
their permission.

252
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,345
You want to sing at their wedding,
sing at their wedding.

253
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:42,329
Yeah, and if you want to look 19,
then you...

254
00:17:42,582 --> 00:17:45,120
You got to do something
about your eyes.

255
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:47,167
What's wrong with my eyes?

256
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:50,715
They give you away.
There's too much wisdom in there.

257
00:17:54,655 --> 00:17:57,252
Put some tea bags on them
for 15 minutes.

258
00:17:57,508 --> 00:18:00,948
- That'll get rid of my wisdom?
- Maybe 10 minutes for you.

259
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,994
Give her the deposit, give her
the ring. I don't care.

260
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:13,790
What did you mean
when you said...

261
00:18:14,103 --> 00:18:16,844
...you didn't want to talk to anyone,
especially me?

262
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:21,651
What a great apology.
And you accept. Bye-bye.

263
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:26,449
No, seriously, what was
the "especially me" part about?

264
00:18:26,697 --> 00:18:30,303
Let's just say it's not the first time
you've stolen my thunder.

265
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:32,639
Hey, here's a thought...

266
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:36,292
Monica, what are you talking about?

267
00:18:36,544 --> 00:18:39,663
My sweet 16. You went to third base
with my cousin Charlie.

268
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,828
Third base.

269
00:18:43,224 --> 00:18:45,371
It was all everybody could talk about.

270
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:49,549
The only reason I did that
was because your party was so boring.

271
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:52,229
We had a caricaturist.

272
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:58,841
Whenever I get married
Guess who won't be asked to sing

273
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:03,501
Somebody named Geller
And somebody else named Bing

274
00:19:07,404 --> 00:19:10,914
Monica, your sweet 16
was like a million years ago.

275
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:12,893
Yet here you are doing it again.

276
00:19:13,145 --> 00:19:15,433
I don't want
to steal your stupid thunder.

277
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:18,530
Why else would you have
made out with Ross?

278
00:19:18,816 --> 00:19:20,405
Got me.

279
00:19:21,843 --> 00:19:25,876
Easy, mimey, the moment has passed.
It ain't gonna happen.

280
00:19:27,653 --> 00:19:29,670
It'd be nice if I could
have this night.

281
00:19:29,949 --> 00:19:32,096
I never wanted any part of your night.

282
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:33,879
No one was supposed to see us.

283
00:19:34,124 --> 00:19:37,765
Is that why you did it in the secret
hallway, where nobody ever goes?

284
00:19:39,482 --> 00:19:41,214
Rachel, I've been thinking.

285
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:45,806
I don't think us getting together
tonight is such a good idea.

286
00:19:46,128 --> 00:19:48,180
I'm calling it off.

287
00:19:49,642 --> 00:19:51,930
Way to save your dignity, my man.

288
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,981
Mon, why, why would I ever want
to take away from your night?

289
00:19:58,234 --> 00:20:00,772
I don't know, maybe you feel
a little resentful.

290
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:03,591
Maybe you thought
you'd get married first.

291
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,081
Maybe you can't stand...

292
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:08,486
...that your formerly fat friend
is getting married before you.

293
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:13,049
Oh, wow, that... You know what?
That is so unfair.

294
00:20:13,334 --> 00:20:15,315
Now I want to steal your thunder.

295
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,203
Come on, Ross. Let's go have sex!

296
00:20:28,086 --> 00:20:31,420
I can't believe you're gonna have sex
on my engagement night.

297
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,330
Well, somebody should.

298
00:20:36,505 --> 00:20:38,379
Look, if we're gonna do this...

299
00:20:38,628 --> 00:20:41,166
We're not.
She's just gonna think we are.

300
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:43,593
I see, so everybody wins.

301
00:20:46,282 --> 00:20:48,085
- Who is it?
- It's Monica, open up.

302
00:20:48,335 --> 00:20:51,845
Okay, Ross, stop it.
Please, wait a minute.

303
00:20:55,502 --> 00:20:57,447
Yeah, you like that, baby?

304
00:21:01,278 --> 00:21:02,381
May we help you?

305
00:21:03,121 --> 00:21:07,534
I wanted to say I hope you have sex,
and I hope you get back together.

306
00:21:07,853 --> 00:21:10,771
I warn you, the night
you announce your engagement...

307
00:21:11,054 --> 00:21:13,307
...I'm going to announce
that I'm pregnant.

308
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:16,818
How is that ever going to happen?

309
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:20,021
Do you want to know why
I was with Ross tonight?

310
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:21,589
- I know why.
- You don't.

311
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:24,935
- Okay, why?
- Because I was sad.

312
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:26,639
What do you mean?

313
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:30,008
Look, I am so...

314
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:33,557
...so happy for you guys.

315
00:21:33,843 --> 00:21:37,591
But you getting married reminds me
of the fact that I'm not.

316
00:21:37,878 --> 00:21:39,301
I'm not even close.

317
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,644
Maybe I just wanted
to make myself feel better.

318
00:21:42,854 --> 00:21:45,878
I know that that's dumb,
but you were so depressed...

319
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,626
...when Ross got married,
you slept with Chandler.

320
00:21:50,821 --> 00:21:52,932
I don't care, she slept with me.

321
00:21:54,474 --> 00:21:58,993
Anyway, sweetie,
I am so sorry I ruined your night.

322
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:03,786
I'm sorry I almost made you
sleep with Ross.

323
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,275
I'm gonna take off.

324
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:15,312
- Congratulations, man.
- Thanks.

325
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,704
And Rachel...

326
00:22:18,341 --> 00:22:19,349
...what can I say?

327
00:22:19,628 --> 00:22:21,324
You missed your chance.

328
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:26,758
From now on, the only person who's
going to enjoy these bad boys is me.

329
00:22:44,052 --> 00:22:46,792
We thought Phoebe would leave

330
00:22:47,044 --> 00:22:49,819
But she just stayed and stayed

331
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:52,358
That's right, I'm here all night

332
00:22:52,645 --> 00:22:54,068
And Chandler will never get...

333
00:22:54,316 --> 00:22:56,889
Hey, here's a dollar.

334
00:22:57,203 --> 00:22:59,908
Consider it a deposit.
Please sing at our wedding.

335
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:01,927
Thank you.

336
00:23:03,118 --> 00:23:06,273
Now who will perform the ceremony

337
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:09,553
Who will perform the cer...

338
00:23:12,372 --> 00:23:14,519
I'll pound on him in the morning.
