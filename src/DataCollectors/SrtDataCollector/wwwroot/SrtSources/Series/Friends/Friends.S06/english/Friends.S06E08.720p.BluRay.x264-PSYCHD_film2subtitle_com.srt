00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:08,549
Hi, my name's Chandler.
I just moved in next door.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,760
Would you like to battle me
in a post-apocalyptic world...

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,723
...for control of the galaxy's
last remaining energy source?

4
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,517
Sure, neighbor. Come on in.

5
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:20,978
Is Janine around?

6
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,646
She's at dance class.

7
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,148
Can I check my room?

8
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:27,234
Don't go through her stuff.
She gets really mad.

9
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,614
Oh, my God.

10
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,617
It's like a guy never lived in here.

11
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:40,122
You gotta be careful. This girl
thing is dangerous. It's spreading.

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,832
It is?

13
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,836
Is this your pretty pink pillow
on the couch?

14
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,004
No.

15
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,924
Is that your tiny little box that's
too small to put anything in?

16
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,176
- No.
- No.

17
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,637
Okay, this is not good.
You are a guy, okay?

18
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,514
This is a "guy's" place.

19
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,851
Soon, you'll be soaking
your fingers in stuff.

20
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,606
- You're right. I'll talk to her.
- Talk to her. Be a man.

21
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,649
- I'm a man.
- Defend yourself.

22
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,320
We have to hem the new dust ruffle.

23
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,072
Be right there, sweetums.

24
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,159
Totally different situation.

25
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,327
Hey, guys.

26
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,496
- How was breakfast with Hillary?
- Okay.

27
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:06,375
She's still depressed because
she broke up with her boyfriend.

28
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:10,003
Is this Hillary,
your hot assistant chef, Hillary?

29
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,549
- Yeah.
- The one that stares at me?

30
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:17,719
No. The one who looked at you once
because you got in her way.

31
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,140
Still, I could tell. She was into me.

32
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,643
Why don't you set us up?

33
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,562
Ooh, are you setting Ross up
with someone?

34
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,772
Does she have a wedding dress?

35
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,693
- Hey.
- Hey.

36
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:37,614
Rachel, I'm making up flyers
to try to get new massage clients.

37
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,450
So can I come to Bloomingdale's
and use the copy machine?

38
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,038
Well, sure, but they might think it's weird
considering I don't work there anymore.

39
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, my God. What happened?

40
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,127
I got a job at Ralph Lauren.

41
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,796
Well, that's great. Congratulations.

42
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,758
A year ago.

43
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,387
You've lasted all year. Good for you.

44
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,685
But, Pheebs, you could still use
the copy machine where I actually work.

45
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,646
But come by at lunch
so my boss doesn't see you.

46
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,107
Kim will freak out.
She already doesn't like me.

47
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,694
- I don't think my boss likes me.
- I don't think mine likes me either.

48
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,780
Maybe it's a universal thing.

49
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,701
Or maybe because you're all hanging
around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.

50
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,372
Yeah, let's head off to work.

51
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,671
- Thank you.
- Sure.

52
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,673
You will not believe this.

53
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,801
I was making copies,
and Ralph Lauren came in.

54
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,012
Oh, my God. Did you talk to him?

55
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,306
Yeah, a little. He seems really nice.

56
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,558
- Good kisser.
- What?

57
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,518
What?

58
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,479
- You kissed him?
- Totally.

59
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,148
Phoebe, are you serious?

60
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,859
Yeah, I was just in there,
he came in and introduced himself.

61
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,363
The next thing I know,
we're making out.

62
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,616
Phoebe, you do know he's married?

63
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,284
No.

64
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,911
Phoebe.

65
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,581
What am I supposed to do, ask every guy
I make out with if he's married?

66
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,459
No, yeah, I should.

67
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,807
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey.

68
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,686
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?
There's a kid in this picture.

69
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,689
Do you, uh, know this kid?
Is it a relative?

70
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,816
No. I just thought it was cute.

71
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,194
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.
Okay, uh...

72
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,281
Look, Janine, I really want you
to feel at home here, but...

73
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,409
...some of this new stuff,
it's too girlie.

74
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,577
Oh. Like what?

75
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,290
Uh, like this.
Pictures of cute babies we don't know.

76
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,250
We can't have that.

77
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,253
Joey, it's Anne Geddes.
She's a famous artist.

78
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:00,799
I don't know this baby.
I don't know if she's a famous artist or not.

79
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:07,472
I don't want to be a jerk, but
you're changing too much around here.

80
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,934
I'm sorry. I just thought
I'd try and make the place a little nicer.

81
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,728
Yeah, but it's too much stuff.

82
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:17,274
You know, you got the candles and
the "foofy schmoofer" thing here.

83
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:21,445
Over here, you got
a picture of a watering can.

84
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,824
- I just thought...
- I'm sure it's a famous watering can.

85
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,242
But come on.

86
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,579
And what is with the really hot stick
in the bathroom?

87
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,373
It's a curling iron.

88
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,673
Oh. Well, that's okay then.

89
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:45,344
Okay, my towels, for instance.
I come into the bathroom...

90
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,598
...and my towel is not on the floor,
where I keep it.

91
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:54,728
It's up here on some hook.
And it smells different.

92
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,773
- It's clean.
- Yeah, well, it feels different.

93
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,399
It's dry.

94
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,654
All right, I can make my peace
with the clean, dry towels.

95
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,282
Okay, also, what is with
these chips you bought?

96
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,078
No, no, no. It's potpourri.
You're supposed to smell it.

97
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,088
Well, that's like summer in a bowl.

98
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,766
Oh.

99
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,476
Kim, hi.

100
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,311
Uh-huh.

101
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:44,444
So I handed in that marketing report,
and I never got to hear what you thought.

102
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,155
- I didn't read it.
- Ah.

103
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,328
So, wow, the spring line's really
gonna be great this year, huh?

104
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,705
Yeah.

105
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,338
So I hear, uh, Ralph Lauren fooled around
with someone in the copy room.

106
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,092
Tell me everything.

107
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,556
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

108
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,057
What's up?

109
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,019
You know...

110
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,896
Oh, my God.

111
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,482
What happened to your teeth?

112
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,067
I whitened them.

113
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,821
Really?

114
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,657
Yeah, what do you think?

115
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,452
I think I shouldn't look
directly at them.

116
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,954
Come on, seriously.

117
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:42,210
- They're really, really, really white.
- What was wrong with your old...

118
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,129
...human teeth?

119
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,675
I did leave the gel on
a little longer than it said to.

120
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,887
- How much longer?
- A day.

121
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,515
Ross, tonight is your date with Hillary.

122
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:59,728
I know. That's why I did it.
Are they really that bad?

123
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,771
No. No, no, no.

124
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,108
You'll be fine.
Hillary's blind, right?

125
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,861
She will be after tonight.

126
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,407
Oh, Rach.
Uh, do you notice anything...?

127
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,118
Your teeth?
Yes, I saw them from outside.

128
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,706
You guys are never gonna
believe this...

129
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:24,127
...but Phoebe made out
with Ralph Lauren.

130
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,629
- What?
- Oh, my God.

131
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,341
She ran into him at my office,
and they just made out.

132
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,469
The craziest thing is,
now my boss likes me because...

133
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,138
...it's the best gossip
she's heard all year.

134
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,099
I am proud of all my friends today.

135
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,103
Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe
made out with Ralph Lauren.

136
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,523
Ugh. I'm so jealous.

137
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,026
Hi, I'm Chandler,
your live-in boyfriend.

138
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,238
Chandler, please. Come on.

139
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,906
Look at him.

140
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,868
Well, I am no woman,
but that is one tasty dish.

141
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,454
Hey.

142
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,747
Here. Ooh.

143
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,124
Who's the silver fox?

144
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,796
That is your make-out buddy.
Don't you recognize him?

145
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:12,717
Oh, wait. "Ooh, Phoebe, I love you.
Kiss me, please."

146
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,680
That's not Ralph Lauren.
It sounds like him, though.

147
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,390
What?

148
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,892
Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look
like that guy.

149
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:25,939
He's young, and he's got long hair
and a beard and a Hacky Sack...

150
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:30,318
Oh, my God. That's not Ralph Lauren.
That's Kenny the copy guy.

151
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,362
What?

152
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,199
Oh, God... I told my boss that someone
made out with Ralph Lauren.

153
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,704
If she finds out that I lied to her,
she is gonna hate me even more. Phoebe!

154
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,456
Why would the copy guy
say he's Ralph Lauren?

155
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,500
To get you to make out with him.

156
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,127
Oh.

157
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,843
Okay, maybe this will make them
look less white.

158
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,016
Nope. Heh.

159
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,060
Okay, so colors that don't work are...

160
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:08,356
...blue, yellow, green, red, black,
white, orange and purple.

161
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,403
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
The date starts in an hour.

162
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:18,992
Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter,
your teeth wouldn't look so bright.

163
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:23,246
Oh, great. So all I need to do
is get some new skin. Thank you.

164
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,583
If we put just a little bit
of makeup on you...

165
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,335
Whoa, whoa.

166
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,837
We're not 13 anymore.

167
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,842
Ross, this is the only thing left
that has a shot at working.

168
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,011
Won't she notice I have makeup on?

169
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,430
Half the guys out there
have makeup on.

170
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,973
What?

171
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,977
Half the people... I mean...
Just try it and see.

172
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,687
No, I am not putting on makeup.

173
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:53,193
Hello? Ross, could you put up
some of these flyers for me?

174
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,779
No! Demon! Demon!

175
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:06,373
Now our drawers will smell nice,
and we didn't waste these pantyhose.

176
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,501
God forbid we throw out old underwear.

177
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,421
You know what?
I'm gonna go over to Joey's.

178
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,715
We're supposed to organize
the wrapping paper.

179
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,762
Yes, but I've really gotten in touch
with my feminine side enough today.

180
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:24,349
In fact, we're two sachets away
from becoming a lesbian couple.

181
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,729
This has been kind of a girlie day.
You're right. I'm sorry.

182
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,482
It's okay. I just feel like I need
to be in a guy place...

183
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,693
...do kind of a man thing.

184
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,278
Go over to Joey's and...

185
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,448
...drink some beer and
hammer up some dry wall.

186
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:45,036
When guys hang out, they don't just
drink beer and hammer up dry wall.

187
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,915
When girls hang out, we don't have
pillow fights in our underwear.

188
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,086
I'm sorry. We do. We do.

189
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,963
I don't know why I said that.

190
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,802
Hey, Chandler.

191
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,347
Come on in.
We're knitting potholders.

192
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,101
No, thanks, Josephine.

193
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,606
Ross, I was wondering if...

194
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,072
Oh, my God. Where are all the men?

195
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,669
- Oh. Hi, Kim.
- Hi, Rachel.

196
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:39,299
Uh, remember that thing that happened
yesterday? Well, it didn't happen.

197
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,926
You didn't cancel the fabric order
from Taiwan?

198
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,305
Okay, two things didn't happen.

199
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,475
Remember I told you someone
made out with Ralph Lauren?

200
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,227
Well, it turns out that's not true.

201
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,480
It's not true?
Oh, that's interesting.

202
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:58,234
Because I checked. Only one keycard
was used to access the copy machine...

203
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,112
...yesterday during lunch,
and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.

204
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,532
Oh, no. No, no, no. Oh, God,
you think I made out with him?

205
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,036
Listen to me, if you think sleeping
with Ralph is gonna get you my job...

206
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,788
...you are sadly mistaken.

207
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,207
Oh, no. I don't want your job. I don't.

208
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,751
Oh, this is such a mistake.
I didn't make out with him.

209
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,880
Nobody made out with him.
I did not use my keycard yesterday.

210
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,591
I don't even know
how to use my keycard.

211
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,011
- Hi, Ralph.
- Hi, Kim.

212
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,949
Yeah. Nothing happened.

213
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,494
You could cut the sexual tension
in here with a knife.

214
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,670
After that, what could I do
except become a chef?

215
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,588
Mm-hm.

216
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,174
And someday soon,
I hope to open my own restaurant.

217
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,759
Mm.

218
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,513
You know, you're a really great listener.

219
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,224
Most guys I go out with,
they just talk and talk.

220
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,938
After a while, it's like, "Shut your mouth."
You know?

221
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:23,111
I've probably been talking too much.
Why don't we talk about you?

222
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,448
Come on, I want to know.

223
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,788
Okay. I'm from Long Island.

224
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,666
I came to the city for college.

225
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:41,671
Um, I, uh, have a 5-year-old son,
and in my spare time...

226
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:46,467
...I like to read spy novels.
But let's talk more about you. Hmm?

227
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:55,310
So if you sear the stems
of the flowers first in a frying pan...

228
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,354
...your arrangement will
look fresh much longer.

229
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,399
Joey, that is such a great tip.

230
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,237
Monica, can you excuse us?
I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.

231
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,033
Okay, but, Joey, come over later.

232
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,035
I'm gonna teach you
how to make a bird feeder...

233
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,495
...out of just a pine cone
and some peanut butter.

234
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,956
Aw. I love birds.

235
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,835
What is the matter with you?

236
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,338
- What?
- You're arranging flowers.

237
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,966
You got dead flowers.

238
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:30,136
You've got a picture of a baby
dressed like flowers.

239
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,264
This is not Joey.

240
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,559
Hey, hey, look, I am still Joey, okay?

241
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,687
Flowers, they're just, you know,
nice to look at.

242
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:44,442
And that happens to be a picture
by a famous artist of a famous baby.

243
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,362
You're turning into a woman.

244
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,447
No, I'm not.

245
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,158
Why would you say that?
That's just mean.

246
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,829
Now I've upset you? What did I say?

247
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,083
It's not what you said.
It's the way you said it.

248
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,293
Oh, my God.

249
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,337
I'm a woman.

250
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,931
So now she thinks that I made out with him
and that I did it to get her job.

251
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,725
- Why didn't you just tell the truth?
- I did.

252
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:23,064
She doesn't think anyone would confuse
Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.

253
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,902
Well, what if Kenny were the real brains
behind the whole company?

254
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,906
What if Kenny hired that Ralph guy
to be the pretty front man, huh?

255
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,866
Did she ever think of that?

256
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,039
You were with Kenny today, weren't you?

257
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,041
- Just for a second.
- Ugh.

258
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,170
- Phoebe, what am I gonna do?
- Well...

259
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,715
The only thing you can do.
Sleep with Ralph Lauren.

260
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:55,346
I'm not gonna sleep with Ralph Lauren.
I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.

261
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,807
Ooh. Sleep with Kenny.

262
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,939
- That wouldn't help me.
- Oh, yes, it would.

263
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,278
- I've had a really good time tonight.
- Mm-hm.

264
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:14,115
You know, I rarely connect with someone
this much on the first date.

265
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,869
Me neither.

266
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,457
Uh, I've had a really
good time too, you know.

267
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,210
Are you gonna eat that bread?

268
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,173
Oh, I just like the smell.

269
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:31,883
Mm.

270
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,427
You make me laugh.

271
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,973
Would you like to move over
to the couch?

272
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,808
Mm-hm.

273
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,523
Maybe I'll just turn down
the lights a little?

274
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,401
How about all the way?

275
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,070
Okay.

276
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,037
Wow, cool poster.

277
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,332
Or should I say, "groovy poster"?

278
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,419
So, uh...

279
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,630
...where were we?

280
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,136
Are those your teeth?

281
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,554
Oh.

282
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,767
You can see them, huh?

283
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,645
Yes. They're insanely white.

284
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,147
I did that for you.

285
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,110
What's the matter with you?

286
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:37,115
What's the matter with me?
You've got a black light. It's 1999.

287
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,833
Oh, good. Kim, hi.

288
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:51,838
Hi, Rachel. Oh. I wanted to ask you, have
you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets?

289
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,258
What am I thinking?
Of course you have.

290
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,968
Okay, look.

291
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,428
I'm sorry that I lied to you before.

292
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,433
You were right. Ralph and I were
an item, but we're not anymore.

293
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,768
Oh, really?

294
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,396
Yeah, he dumped me.

295
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,025
He said, "Rachel, I can't do this.

296
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,445
Even though you're a very, very...

297
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,031
...very beautiful woman...

298
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,827
...I can't do this.
I'm married and I'm sorry."

299
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,330
And I don't know why, but he said,
"And you will never get promoted...

300
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,501
...especially not above Kim,
who is an integral cog...

301
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,503
...in the Ralph Lauren machine."

302
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,507
You expect me to believe...

303
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,386
- Hi, Ralph.
- Hi, Kim.

304
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,865
Oh, my God.

305
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:06,245
He just gave you the coldest look
I've ever seen. It's like he hates you.

306
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,039
Then it is true.

307
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:13,878
Of course it's true.
And it hurts so bad.

308
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,839
Oh, honey, come here.

309
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,925
Oh, it'll be okay.

310
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,637
We've all been there.

311
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,308
You and Ralph?

312
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,853
Kenny the copy boy.

313
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,616
- Hey.
- Hey.

314
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:48,079
- Uh, I need to talk to you.
- What's the matter? You upset?

315
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,957
I'm sorry, but we gotta get rid of
all this girlie stuff in here.

316
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,833
I, uh... I gotta be a man.

317
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:57,171
Okay? The living room
has to remain a guy place, okay?

318
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,173
That's just the way it has to be.

319
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,009
If that's what you want,
I'll just put it all in my room.

320
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,886
Good. Great.

321
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,597
And, uh, thanks for being
so understanding.

322
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,517
I didn't want to make
a big deal out of this.

323
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:14,272
But you could, uh, put the picture
of the famous baby in my room.

324
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,315
I mean, if you want to.

325
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,610
Okay.

326
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,613
And, uh, maybe the watering can there.

327
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:23,906
Sure.

328
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,575
And a couple of these
little tiny boxes.

329
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:31,080
Joey, do you want me
to put it all in your room?

330
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,248
Okay.
