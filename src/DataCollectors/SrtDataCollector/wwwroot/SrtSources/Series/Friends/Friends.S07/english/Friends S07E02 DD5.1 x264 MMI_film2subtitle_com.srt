1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,165
Chandler, you're doing so well
with this whole getting married...

2
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:12,026
...never gonna sleep with anyone for the
rest of your life thing. I thinks it's great.

3
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:17,183
- Hey. Who wants French toast?
- I'll have some.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,526
Me too. Eggs and milk in the fridge.
Thanks.

5
00:00:22,893 --> 00:00:25,253
- What's the matter?
- My hand feels weird.

6
00:00:25,502 --> 00:00:27,375
I guess it's because I'm engaged!

7
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,867
- When will that start getting annoying?
- Start?

8
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:35,450
Let's start the wedding plans.

9
00:00:35,696 --> 00:00:36,835
- Okay.
- Already?

10
00:00:37,157 --> 00:00:41,155
We got a lot to do. We gotta think
about the flowers, the music...

11
00:00:41,436 --> 00:00:44,247
- I have thoughts on the music...
- Chandler. Too many cooks.

12
00:00:46,202 --> 00:00:50,271
Take it from me. All you have to do is
show up and try to say the right name.

13
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:57,992
- What in God's name is that?
- Oh, my God, the wedding book?

14
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,636
I haven't seen that since fourth grade.

15
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:05,959
This baby has everything. Take,
you know, locations, for instance:

16
00:01:06,243 --> 00:01:09,992
First organized alphabetically,
then geographically...

17
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:12,497
...then by square footage.

18
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:16,466
That is so smart.

19
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,146
Break it off. Break it off now.

20
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:24,191
Look, here's the invitation you used to your
wedding to John Lynch in the fifth grade.

21
00:01:24,404 --> 00:01:28,331
Remember how I got sick and
Ross had to fill in as a bridesmaid?

22
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,854
I was a brides-boy.

23
00:01:33,902 --> 00:01:36,049
I don't smell French toast, brides-boy.

24
00:01:38,982 --> 00:01:42,102
The One With Rachel's Book

25
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,280
That conclusively proves...

26
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:22,307
...that I had the idea
for Jurassic Park first.

27
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:24,186
Let's take a look...

28
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,762
Phoebe, what are you doing here?

29
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:30,527
I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
It's about Monica and Chandler.

30
00:02:30,808 --> 00:02:33,169
Oh, my God. Of course.

31
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:36,128
Would you please excuse me
for a moment?

32
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,991
Do you know each other's hometowns?
Why don't you...?

33
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:42,355
What's going on?

34
00:02:42,603 --> 00:02:47,158
Well, not much. I was just thinking
that since they just got engaged...

35
00:02:47,474 --> 00:02:49,656
...it would be nice
if they have privacy.

36
00:02:49,874 --> 00:02:53,516
So could I just move in with you
for a couple days?

37
00:02:56,554 --> 00:03:00,195
Okay, sure. But what's wrong
with Monica and Chandler?

38
00:03:00,452 --> 00:03:02,599
Nothing. Why?

39
00:03:04,904 --> 00:03:06,363
Phoebe, you said it was urgent.

40
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:09,729
Yeah, it is.
My movie starts in, like, five minutes.

41
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:17,069
Do you realize I have a classroom
full of students?

42
00:03:18,891 --> 00:03:23,019
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude.
Does anyone want to come to the movies?

43
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:29,252
I haven't cleared the
budget with my parents...

44
00:03:29,571 --> 00:03:31,623
...but tell me how this is for music:

45
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,587
A string quartet for the processional,
a jazz trio for cocktails...

46
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:38,087
...the Bay City Rollers
for dancing...

47
00:03:38,374 --> 00:03:41,220
Wait, that was
for my sixth grade wedding.

48
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:46,017
You couldn't get them anyway. Ian
doesn't even play anymore and Derek...

49
00:03:48,116 --> 00:03:50,477
Derek is a name I shouldn't know.

50
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:55,315
Mon, do you have another pillow,
something a little snugglier?

51
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:58,725
Why are you napping here
instead of at your place?

52
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,023
- The duck.
- What... The duck?

53
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:03,592
What the hell
did the damn duck do now?

54
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:08,986
Well, he did not get sick
somewhere in there...

55
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:12,495
...and it was immediately found
and properly cleaned up.

56
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:15,423
Do I get to look at this book...

57
00:04:15,706 --> 00:04:18,897
...or is it just for people
involved in the wedding?

58
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:22,798
Of course you can look at it.
I want your opinion.

59
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:24,149
Here you go.

60
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,906
- What about centerpieces?
- Centerpieces!

61
00:04:27,187 --> 00:04:30,141
- Roses or lilies?
- Definitely roses.

62
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:36,544
I think they're more "wedding-y."

63
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:43,495
- But lilies are the clear choice.
- Oh, my God, it's like one mind.

64
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:49,450
Guys, guys, you gotta let me nap.

65
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,192
I'm gonna get cranky.

66
00:04:53,177 --> 00:04:56,546
Joey, there's a perfectly good couch
across the hall.

67
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:59,082
Yes, it is perfectly good...

68
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:02,808
...and it is not one of the places
the duck got sick.

69
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:04,899
What?

70
00:05:05,632 --> 00:05:09,380
- All right, I'm gonna go.
- Joey, what did the duck do?

71
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:12,620
I don't know,
but he did not eat your face cream.

72
00:05:24,872 --> 00:05:27,683
Hey, little buddy. How you feeling?

73
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:33,734
What the hell is in that face cream?

74
00:05:47,382 --> 00:05:49,564
That's so soft.

75
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,365
Pillowcases!

76
00:06:09,196 --> 00:06:13,882
"Zelda looked at the chimney sweep.
Her father, the vicar..."

77
00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:15,416
Vicar?

78
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:18,999
"...wouldn't be home for hours.

79
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:21,160
Her loins were burning.

80
00:06:21,443 --> 00:06:26,520
She threw caution to the wind
and reached out and grabbed his..."

81
00:06:31,462 --> 00:06:33,407
This is a dirty book!

82
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,023
Phoebe?

83
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,873
Oh, Ross, hi.

84
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:57,405
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- Sorry, I'm with a client right now.

85
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:01,937
- Phoebe!
- Okay, let's talk outside.

86
00:07:02,845 --> 00:07:06,807
Unfortunately, this time will be
counted as part of your massage.

87
00:07:07,054 --> 00:07:09,450
So try...

88
00:07:09,664 --> 00:07:11,953
...and think relaxing thoughts.

89
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:14,351
And don't touch any of my dinosaurs.

90
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:17,761
I know they're cool, but they're mine.

91
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:22,741
Phoebe, you can't massage people
in my apartment.

92
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:25,489
I did it at Monica and Chandler's.

93
00:07:25,703 --> 00:07:27,328
And they knew about it?

94
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,703
Okay, Ross, what is this really about?

95
00:07:34,436 --> 00:07:38,220
This is my home and I want to be
able to come and go when I want.

96
00:07:38,472 --> 00:07:41,841
I will find someplace else
to do the rest of my appointments.

97
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,819
I don't know what the big deal is.

98
00:07:44,073 --> 00:07:47,027
I don't want naked,
greasy strangers in my apartment...

99
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:51,437
...when I want to kick back
with a puzzle... Beer, cold beer.

100
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,351
Hey, Joey. What are you doing?

101
00:07:56,772 --> 00:08:00,591
Sweeping. Why?
Does it turn you on?

102
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:03,964
No.

103
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:09,434
What if I was sweeping a chimney?

104
00:08:11,663 --> 00:08:13,644
Joey, did you eat my face cream?

105
00:08:17,055 --> 00:08:19,831
Where are you going?
The vicar won't be home for hours.

106
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:29,717
Joey, where did you learn that word?

107
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,023
Where do you think...

108
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,807
...Zelda?

109
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:41,957
- You found my book?!
- Yeah, I did!

110
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,000
Joey, what are you doing
going into my bedroom?

111
00:08:46,316 --> 00:08:50,278
I'm sorry. I went in there to take a nap.
I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!

112
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:56,365
God! I cannot believe you invaded
my privacy like that!

113
00:08:56,544 --> 00:08:58,311
Zelda.

114
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:03,146
Now, you seem a little tense. Maybe
you'll relax if I gave you a nice milk bath.

115
00:09:03,363 --> 00:09:05,415
Okay, you know what?

116
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:08,891
- I don't even like that part.
- Oh, I do.

117
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:13,409
You know what? I don't care.
I'm not ashamed of my book.

118
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:18,560
There's nothing wrong with a woman
enjoying a little erotica.

119
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:22,665
It's just a healthy expression
of female sexuality...

120
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:26,878
...which, by the way, is something
that you will never understand.

121
00:09:29,457 --> 00:09:31,011
You got porn.

122
00:09:52,838 --> 00:09:56,728
- Hello.
- Hi, is Phoebe here?

123
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:00,868
- No, she's out for the night.
- Oh, great.

124
00:10:01,674 --> 00:10:04,035
Can I help you with something?

125
00:10:04,457 --> 00:10:06,260
I don't know. Are you a masseur?

126
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:08,384
Yes, I am.

127
00:10:10,372 --> 00:10:12,732
Great! Dad?

128
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:21,257
Thank you so much.
I'll pick him up in an hour.

129
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,786
You need help with that?

130
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,751
Your parents must've been thrilled
when you told them you were engaged.

131
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,189
Oh, yeah.
I should probably call them.

132
00:10:46,277 --> 00:10:48,495
I remember when we first got engaged.

133
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,859
- I've never heard that story.
- Dad, you don't...

134
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:53,296
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant.

135
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:56,636
I still don't know how.

136
00:10:57,028 --> 00:11:01,511
You don't know how? Your dog
thought my diaphragm was a chew toy.

137
00:11:04,612 --> 00:11:06,344
What a sweet story.

138
00:11:07,465 --> 00:11:10,276
At least you're not hearing it
at your fifth grade Halloween party.

139
00:11:10,596 --> 00:11:12,150
They wanted a scary story.

140
00:11:13,832 --> 00:11:16,157
We're really excited
about our wedding plans.

141
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:20,580
I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big
withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.

142
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:27,946
- What?
- You tell her, Jack. I can't do it.

143
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:30,737
You have the wedding fund, don't you?

144
00:11:30,985 --> 00:11:34,175
We have it.
Only, now we call it "the beach house."

145
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:39,670
You spent my wedding
fund on the beach house?

146
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:41,385
We're sorry. We assumed...

147
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,406
...that if you got married after 30
you'd pay for it yourself.

148
00:11:44,936 --> 00:11:47,261
You bought the beach house
when I was 23.

149
00:11:47,685 --> 00:11:49,761
So you've had seven years
of beach fun...

150
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:52,232
...and you can't put a price on that.

151
00:11:54,887 --> 00:11:56,725
We do feel bad about this.

152
00:11:56,974 --> 00:11:58,777
We saved again
when you dated Richard...

153
00:11:59,096 --> 00:12:01,669
...then that went to hell,
so we redid the kitchen.

154
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:06,052
What about Chandler?

155
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,622
It was Chandler.
We didn't think he'd propose.

156
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:13,633
Clearly I did not start drinking
enough at the start of the meal.

157
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:16,735
I can't believe there's no money
for my wedding.

158
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,996
Maybe, if your father hadn't tried...

159
00:12:19,275 --> 00:12:21,945
...to sell ice over the Internet.

160
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:25,804
- It seemed like such a simple idea.
- Stupid, Jack. The word is stupid.

161
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:29,249
Enough. I don't want
to hear about it anymore.

162
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:30,891
Good luck, Chandler.

163
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:59,522
Okay, now I'm going to...

164
00:13:00,573 --> 00:13:01,818
...touch you.

165
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,068
That's soft.

166
00:13:45,803 --> 00:13:50,180
Why does Joey keep talking
about chimney sweeps and vicars?

167
00:13:51,334 --> 00:13:55,224
I thinks he's just been rehearsing
for an episode of his show.

168
00:13:55,892 --> 00:13:59,153
Because it really sounds
like a bad porn novel.

169
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,026
Do you think your parents
could help pay for it?

170
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:05,214
I don't know.

171
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,659
My mother spent most of her money
on her fourth wedding.

172
00:14:09,913 --> 00:14:12,202
She's saving the rest for her divorce.

173
00:14:12,557 --> 00:14:17,208
And any extra cash my father has
he saves for his yearly trips to...

174
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:19,369
...Dollywood.

175
00:14:21,743 --> 00:14:25,253
- What happened at dinner?
- My parents spent the wedding fund.

176
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:28,629
My God, what did you order?

177
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:34,788
Wait, there's no money?
Well, this is terrible.

178
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:38,507
You guys are gonna have to get
married in, like, a rec center.

179
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:41,287
Oh, my God, you're right.

180
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:45,917
We're gonna have to be out by 6 so they
can take out the floor for senior swim.

181
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:50,711
- Honey, it's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not gonna be okay.

182
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:55,482
- No swing band, no lilies.
- No, but that's good.

183
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:57,952
You don't want lilies.

184
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,910
If a cat ate them, it would die.

185
00:15:04,014 --> 00:15:07,976
- What?
- I'm just saying, now you could invite cats.

186
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:11,770
It's gonna be okay.

187
00:15:11,981 --> 00:15:14,686
I mean, you don't need to have this...

188
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:17,785
...rustic Italian feast.

189
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,181
You don't need this custom-made...

190
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:24,469
...empire-waisted, duchess satin gown.

191
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:26,409
You can wear off-the-rack.

192
00:15:31,952 --> 00:15:33,447
It's really gonna be okay.

193
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:37,796
The important thing is that we love each
other and we're gonna get married.

194
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,715
Do you even understand what
"off-the-rack" means?

195
00:15:43,711 --> 00:15:45,620
Why don't you pay for it yourself?

196
00:15:45,868 --> 00:15:47,327
How? I don't have any money.

197
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:49,553
- Well, I have some.
- How much?

198
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,809
Well, close to...

199
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:05,700
- Are you kidding me?!
- How much?

200
00:16:05,944 --> 00:16:08,790
- Enough for wedding scenario A.
- Really?

201
00:16:09,283 --> 00:16:14,563
Scenario A has lilies. Someone's gonna have
to break it to the cats and it won't be me.

202
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,283
How great are you, you little saver!

203
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:21,597
This is exactly
the budget of my dream wedding.

204
00:16:21,808 --> 00:16:24,726
You guys are so made for each other.

205
00:16:25,914 --> 00:16:29,318
You're not suggesting that we spend
all of the money on the wedding?

206
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:31,096
Yeah.

207
00:16:32,663 --> 00:16:36,341
Look, Mon, I've been saving this money
for six years...

208
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:40,794
...and I kind of had some of it earmarked
for the future, not just for a party.

209
00:16:41,048 --> 00:16:44,654
Hello, Mr. Chandler.

210
00:16:47,485 --> 00:16:50,960
Sweetie, this is the most special day
of our lives.

211
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:55,062
I realize that, honey, but I'm not gonna
spend all the money on one party.

212
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,530
Honey, I love you.

213
00:16:57,853 --> 00:17:01,222
But if you call our wedding
a party one more time...

214
00:17:01,575 --> 00:17:03,034
...you may not get invited.

215
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,747
We can always earn more money.
We're only gonna get married once.

216
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:14,407
I understand, but I have to put
my foot down. The answer is no.

217
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,848
You're gonna have to
"put your foot down"?

218
00:17:18,101 --> 00:17:20,390
Yes, I am.

219
00:17:22,973 --> 00:17:25,546
Money and a firm hand.

220
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,363
Finally a Chandler I
can get on board with.

221
00:17:37,028 --> 00:17:39,424
- Hey, Rach.
- Joey.

222
00:17:41,203 --> 00:17:43,873
Hey, Rach, do you smell smoke?

223
00:17:44,126 --> 00:17:48,361
I get it. Smoke, chimney,
chimney sweep. Very funny. Ha, ha.

224
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:52,469
No, no, I'm serious.
You don't smell it?

225
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,413
Something's on fire.

226
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,574
No, I don't smell anything.

227
00:17:57,207 --> 00:18:00,540
Oh, you know what? It's probably
just your burning loins.

228
00:18:05,348 --> 00:18:08,266
- Hey, what are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

229
00:18:12,063 --> 00:18:13,866
Damn, this coffee's cold.

230
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:16,228
Do you mind if I heat this up
on your loins?

231
00:18:20,274 --> 00:18:23,987
You know, I cannot believe
you told him. Joey...

232
00:18:24,484 --> 00:18:27,604
So I guess you bought that book
after we broke up.

233
00:18:27,894 --> 00:18:31,476
Yeah, I did, because I wore out
my first copy when I was with you.

234
00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:34,253
Oh, yeah?

235
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:38,464
Well, when we were going out,
I read tons of porno magazines.

236
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:40,722
What's up?

237
00:18:42,262 --> 00:18:46,153
Ross, how could you do that
to an old man?

238
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,535
Excuse me, ladies.

239
00:18:51,586 --> 00:18:53,045
I'm sorry?

240
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,580
My massage client, Arthur.

241
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:58,749
His daughter said some guy
that worked for me...

242
00:18:58,998 --> 00:19:00,871
...gave him a really weird massage.

243
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,966
I gave him an extremely
professional massage.

244
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:07,623
He said you poked
at him with wooden spoons.

245
00:19:07,869 --> 00:19:10,574
Okay, so it wasn't
a traditional massage.

246
00:19:10,862 --> 00:19:13,922
But I did give him acupressure
with a pair of chopsticks...

247
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:18,330
...and I gently exfoliated him
with a mop.

248
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:24,387
Well, he's never coming back.
You just cost me $80 a week.

249
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:27,759
This is your fault.
You didn't move his appointment.

250
00:19:28,117 --> 00:19:30,893
Oh, it's my fault?
You didn't have to massage him.

251
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,141
You could've sent him away.

252
00:19:32,502 --> 00:19:35,456
You could've not rolled Tonka trucks
up and down his back.

253
00:19:37,164 --> 00:19:39,761
He said he liked that!

254
00:19:42,278 --> 00:19:45,232
You're right, you're right.
I'm sorry.

255
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:48,774
Dude, what are you massaging
an old man for?

256
00:19:51,046 --> 00:19:53,406
- His daughter was hot.
- Gotcha.

257
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,422
Look, Ross,
I really need that $80 every week.

258
00:19:59,604 --> 00:20:02,202
I'm sure you'll find
another massage client, Phoebe.

259
00:20:02,423 --> 00:20:06,028
Yeah, I'm sure I will too. But until then,
I'm going to massage you every week...

260
00:20:06,249 --> 00:20:09,131
...for the price of $ 100.
- You just said 80.

261
00:20:09,346 --> 00:20:11,291
You want me to mess up your puzzle?

262
00:20:11,504 --> 00:20:13,615
A hundred it is.

263
00:20:26,046 --> 00:20:27,635
Hello, Zelda.

264
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:32,854
- Who are you supposed to be?
- The vicar.

265
00:20:33,735 --> 00:20:37,697
- Do you even know what a vicar is?
- Like a goalie, right?

266
00:20:39,998 --> 00:20:41,456
Look, that's enough.

267
00:20:41,668 --> 00:20:43,127
The joke's over. I'm sick of it.

268
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:46,979
You mean this isn't the sweet torment
you've been waiting all your life for?

269
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,667
Joey, I'm serious,
all right? It's enough.

270
00:20:49,878 --> 00:20:52,868
You make stupid jokes
and sleazy innuendoes...

271
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:54,988
...and it's just not funny anymore.

272
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:58,463
I'm sorry. Rach, I'm sorry.

273
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:03,022
Maybe I could make it up to you
by taking you roughly in the barn.

274
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:09,042
All right, that's it.
You wanna do it? Let's do it.

275
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:13,915
That's right.
I wanna do it with you.

276
00:21:15,764 --> 00:21:20,390
Been trying to fight it,
but you just said all the right things.

277
00:21:20,704 --> 00:21:21,843
I did?

278
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:25,426
Yeah. Oh, I've been waiting so long
to get on that body.

279
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:28,945
- This body?
- Yeah, that's right.

280
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:31,243
Come on, Joey, sex me up.

281
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:35,107
You're starting to sound like
the butcher's wife in chapter seven.

282
00:21:35,699 --> 00:21:39,661
Come on, now. Don't keep me
waiting. Get those clothes off.

283
00:21:39,908 --> 00:21:44,037
But I'd keep that helmet on,
because you're in for a rough ride.

284
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:47,070
I don't want to. I'm scared.

285
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,701
Listen...

286
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,062
...I've been thinking.

287
00:22:01,306 --> 00:22:05,612
It's not fair of me to ask you to
spend all of your money on our wedding.

288
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:08,815
I mean, you work really hard for that.

289
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,255
- Well.
- Well, you work for that.

290
00:22:13,414 --> 00:22:15,952
Look, I've thought about it too.

291
00:22:16,231 --> 00:22:20,609
I'm sorry. I think we should spend
all of the money on the wedding.

292
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:25,478
- You do?
- Yeah, I'm putting my foot down.

293
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,999
Look, when I proposed,
I told you...

294
00:22:30,322 --> 00:22:33,656
...that I would do anything
to make you happy.

295
00:22:33,941 --> 00:22:37,274
And if having the perfect wedding
makes you happy...

296
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,635
...then that's what we're gonna do.

297
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:42,460
You are so sweet.

298
00:22:46,987 --> 00:22:49,560
What about the future and stuff?

299
00:22:49,805 --> 00:22:52,059
Forget about the future and stuff.

300
00:22:52,345 --> 00:22:53,661
So we only have two kids.

301
00:22:53,911 --> 00:22:57,659
We'll pick our favorite and
that one will get to go to college.

302
00:22:58,747 --> 00:23:01,320
- Have you thought about that?
- Yeah.

303
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,153
How many kids were we gonna have?

304
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:07,157
Four. A boy, twin girls
and another boy.

305
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,777
What else did you think about?

306
00:23:11,097 --> 00:23:14,015
Well, stuff like where we'd live,
you know.

307
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:16,931
Like a small place outside the city...

308
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:20,378
...where our kids could learn
to ride their bikes.

309
00:23:20,701 --> 00:23:23,441
We could have a cat that had a bell
on its collar...

310
00:23:23,797 --> 00:23:28,209
...and we could hear it every time
it ran through the little kitty door.

311
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:32,456
We'd have an apartment over the garage
where Joey could grow old.

312
00:23:37,992 --> 00:23:39,202
You know what?

313
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:43,095
I don't want a big, fancy wedding.

314
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,639
- Sure you do.
- No.

315
00:23:47,351 --> 00:23:52,002
I want everything that you've
just said. I want a marriage.

316
00:23:53,161 --> 00:23:54,514
You sure?

317
00:23:57,301 --> 00:24:00,492
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

318
00:24:05,686 --> 00:24:09,506
When you were talking
about our future, you said cat.

319
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:11,523
But you meant dog, right?

320
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,025
- Yeah, totally.
- Oh, good.

321
00:24:22,386 --> 00:24:24,675
Room temperature okay?

322
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:28,086
- Excellent. Is the music too loud?
- No.

323
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:29,547
Good.

324
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,301
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

325
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,411
Were you expecting a traditional
massage with the hands?

326
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,880
Fine.

327
00:24:45,766 --> 00:24:48,127
Now, just try to relax.
