1
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:06,046
So, uh, your first sexual experience
was with a woman?

2
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:09,758
All right, I was 15.
It was my best friend, Ruth...

3
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:12,344
...and we got drunk on that hard cider.

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,139
And then suddenly, I don't know,
we were making out.

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,975
Tell it again.

6
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,646
Seriously.

7
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,484
Is that woman capable of talking
about anything else but sex?

8
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:33,115
Yeah, sure. Well, you know, earlier,
she was talking about geography.

9
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:37,578
Joey, she was listing the countries
she's done it in.

10
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,040
Well, I think we all learned something.

11
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,960
Hey, you guys. Look what I found.
Look at this.

12
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,337
That's my mom's writing. Look.

13
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:51,258
"Me and Frank and Phoebe,
graduation, 1965."

14
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:55,012
- Do you know what that means?
- That you're actually 50?

15
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,515
No, no. That's not "me" Phoebe.
That's her pal, Phoebe.

16
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,976
According to her high school yearbook,
they were BFF.

17
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,813
- Best friends forever.
BOTH Oh.

18
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,273
- That's great.
- That is so cool.

19
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,941
I know. So this woman probably could...

20
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,360
Like, has all kinds of stories
about my parents.

21
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,362
And she might even know
where my dad is.

22
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,698
So I looked her up
and she lives by the beach.

23
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,992
So maybe this weekend
we can go to the beach.

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,368
- Yeah, we can.
- Yeah.

25
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,371
- Shoot, I can't go. I have to work.
- That's too bad.

26
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,707
Aw, big fat bummer.

27
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,711
So great. Okay, tomorrow
we're gonna drive out to Montauk.

28
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,214
Hey, Bonnie had sex there.

29
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,435
Would you look at them?

30
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,939
I'm never gonna find a boyfriend again.

31
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,316
I'm gonna die an old maid.

32
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,777
You're not gonna die an old maid.

33
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,530
Maybe an old spinster cook.

34
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,369
- Thanks.
- Hey, besides, worse comes to worse...

35
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,788
...I'll be your boyfriend.
- Ha-ha-ha.

36
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,750
Yeah, right.

37
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,922
Why is that so funny?

38
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,466
You made a joke, right?

39
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,218
So I laughed.

40
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,347
A little too hard.

41
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,350
What, am I not, uh, boyfriend material?

42
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,103
No. You're Chandler.

43
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,524
You know. Chandler.

44
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,195
Okay, so we've established my name,
and hit me.

45
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,865
But theoretically, say we weren't friends.
Say it's a blind date.

46
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,034
I show up at your door and I'm,
like, uh:

47
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,411
"Hey, nice to meet you. Hey. Hey."

48
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,875
I'd probably be scared of a guy
using a fake voice.

49
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,086
- Hey.
- Oh, hey. Oh, good. You bought food.

50
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,464
No, just my luggage.

51
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,509
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

52
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,678
All right. Yeah.

53
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,890
Oh, I am having
the best karma this week.

54
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,392
First, I find this woman
who knew my parents...

55
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,520
...and then my client with the fuzzy back
gives me his beach house.

56
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,482
What about that, uh,
bike messenger you hit?

57
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,068
Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.

58
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,237
- Hey.
- Hey.

59
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,405
Hey, check out the hat.

60
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,744
Wait a minute, I know that hat.

61
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,621
I was taken aboard that hat.

62
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,166
They did experiments on me.

63
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,793
I can't have children.

64
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,421
Seriously, where did you get the hat?

65
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,048
Ross gave it to me.

66
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,926
- Aw, I think she looks good.
- Thank you.

67
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,470
Did he buy it for you...

68
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,763
...or win it for you?

69
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,600
Well, excuse me,
my fashion-impaired friends...

70
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,019
...I'm here to tell you that hats are back.

71
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:34,940
And this time, they've ganged up
and formed one giant super-hat.

72
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,239
Go, go, go.

73
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,574
Now everybody
wants to be under the hat.

74
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,747
Oy.

75
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,001
What's with all this sand?

76
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,795
Oh, yeah. Bob said
there might be flood damage.

77
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,214
Either that or he has a really big cat.

78
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,179
Well, yes, it's kind of an unusual house.

79
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:10,142
It has, um, three beautiful bedrooms
and, uh, no baths.

80
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:14,062
But, you know, the ocean is right there.

81
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,647
Knock, knock, knock.

82
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,816
Hang on a second. Come in, come in.

83
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,068
All right, so think about it
and call me back.

84
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,114
- Are you Phoebe Abbott?
- Uh, yes.

85
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,659
Surprise, Phoebe Abbott.
I'm your best friend's daughter.

86
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,371
You're Irwin's daughter?

87
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,374
I know. I mean, your old best friend.
Here.

88
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,254
- Lily? From high school? Remember?
- Oh, God. Lily. Yes.

89
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,548
Of course I remember Lily.

90
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,301
I... Then you must be...

91
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,470
Phoebe, Phoebe.

92
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,097
Phoebe, yeah.
She named me after you, I guess.

93
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,976
Uh-huh. Wow. Well. Look, there's Frank.

94
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,853
Yeah. Yes. Yes, yes.

95
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,230
- That's my dad. That's Frank. Ha, ha.
- Oh!

96
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,442
- I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.
- Oh!

97
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,028
Take it easy. If you want,
there's cookies on the counter.

98
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,156
- Or sangria. I could make sangria.
- No, no.

99
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,242
- Sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
- Oh.

100
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:14,748
So, um, anyway, um,
I've been looking for my father and, um...

101
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,336
- Have you heard from him or seen him?
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.

102
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,047
I guess I lost track of everybody
after high school.

103
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,590
Oh.

104
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,300
Okay.

105
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,429
Well, so tell me everything
about my parents. Everything.

106
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,808
Oh, well, you know,
we were always together.

107
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,018
The other kids had a nickname
for the three of us.

108
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,146
- Oh, what? What was it?
- The Three Losers.

109
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,857
Oh, poor Lily.

110
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,401
Oh.

111
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:46,738
You know, I heard about what happened.
That must have been just terrible for you...

112
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,241
...losing your mother that way.

113
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,285
Yeah, no, it was great.

114
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,340
You know what a really good
rainy-day game is?

115
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,051
- What?
- I mean, naked game.

116
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,929
Strip poker. We should play strip poker.

117
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,639
- No.
- Are you crazy?

118
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:16,476
Come on. When you go away,
you have to play. It's, like, a law.

119
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,688
- All done.
- Aw, thank you.

120
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,232
Okay. Who's next?

121
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,527
No.

122
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,696
No way.

123
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:32,075
Come on, please. I'm bored.
You let me do it once before.

124
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,666
Yeah, well, if, uh...
If that's the rule this weekend...

125
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,004
- Get away.
- Take it like a man, Ross. Come on.

126
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,423
- No, no.
- Oh, come on.

127
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,591
Big bullies.

128
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,970
No, no, no.

129
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,229
- Hey.
- Hey.

130
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,856
Oh. So how are we doing?

131
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,733
Bored and bored.

132
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,737
Hey, you know what naked card game's
never boring?

133
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,530
No.

134
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,492
So, what's Phoebe like?

135
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,120
I'm kind, caring and sweet.
What's Monica like? Ha, ha.

136
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,082
Uh, no, the other Phoebe.
The one you went to see?

137
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,919
Oh, I think she knows
where my dad is.

138
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,086
- What?
- Cool.

139
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,713
Well, where is he?

140
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,341
She was pretending
like she hasn't heard from him in years...

141
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,593
...but I found this picture on her fridge.

142
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,346
Look, isn't this what he would
look like now?

143
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,598
- Totally familiar.
- Yeah.

144
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,683
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

145
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,852
Why would she lie to you?

146
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,896
I don't know,
but we're having dinner tomorrow.

147
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,523
I figured she's gonna tell me then.

148
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,900
You know, maybe she just wanted
to give him time...

149
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,528
...to buy me presents. I don't know.
Ha, ha.

150
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,031
- So you're all bored?
- Yes.

151
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,493
All right, I'm gonna close my eyes
and point to someone.

152
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:00,413
And whoever I point to has to come up with
something fun to do. And we have to do it.

153
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,958
- Okay. All right. Fan out. Fan out.
- Okay.

154
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,377
Okay.

155
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,380
Ooh, you know, we could just do this.

156
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,676
Okay, um...

157
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,844
We all have to play strip poker?

158
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,596
Oh, yes!

159
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,766
Strip Happy Days game?

160
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,353
Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards,
so it was either this...

161
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,106
...or Strip Bag-of-Old-Knitting-Stuff.

162
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,275
Done.

163
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,818
Okay.

164
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:33,947
"Fonzie gives you two thumbs up.
Collect two cool points."

165
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,074
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

166
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,911
Get five cool points, you get to make
someone take off one item of clothing.

167
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,747
It hasn't happened yet,
but we're all very excited.

168
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,125
Okay, come on.

169
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,336
Daddy needs a new pair
of electromagnetic microscopes...

170
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,797
...for the Prehistoric Forensics
department.

171
00:09:56,137 --> 00:10:00,599
Okay. "Take Pinky Tuscadero
up to Inspiration Point.

172
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,059
Collect three cool points." Yeah.

173
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,936
Which gives me five.

174
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,480
And let's see,
who is gonna lose their clothes?

175
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:12,527
Um, I think I pick our strip poker
sponsor, Mr. Joey Tribbiani.

176
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,491
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.

177
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,540
"Your band is playing at Arnold's.
Collect three cool points."

178
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:30,920
Which means I have five,
and that means I get Joey's boxers.

179
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,678
Fine. Gang up on me.

180
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,723
I got you all right where I want you.

181
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,892
Come on. Take them off.

182
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,602
Actually, you know, it's kind of cold.

183
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,439
So how about I keep my boxers on
and give you all a peek at the good stuff?

184
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,150
All right,
I'm gonna make more margaritas.

185
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,236
Whoa, hey, what are you doing?
Trying to get me drunk?

186
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,739
I'm just making margaritas.

187
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,992
Think I'll help her out.

188
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,956
- What is going on here?
- What?

189
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,459
- You're painting his toenails.
- Oh, come on.

190
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,212
- Chasing him around the room.
- Monica, please.

191
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,255
He's totally flirting with you too.

192
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,092
He is, isn't he?

193
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,930
I don't know. I don't know. Maybe it's just
being here at the beach together...

194
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,348
...or but it's like something...

195
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,893
Hey.

196
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,856
- Hi, Bonnie.
- Hi.

197
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,192
My boss let me off early,
so I took the train.

198
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,236
- Oh.
- What are you guys doing?

199
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,030
We're playing Strip Happy Days game.

200
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,075
Cool. I'll catch up.

201
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,336
So you still don't think...

202
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,588
...I'm boyfriend material?

203
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,340
Huh?

204
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,844
Saw you checking me out
during the game last night.

205
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:04,139
- You didn't even take off your pants.
- Yeah, well, lucky for you.

206
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,726
- What?
- I don't know.

207
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:13,398
Well, is everybody else having
just the best time?

208
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,858
Shh. Shh.

209
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,067
Joey's asleep.

210
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:29,289
After he passed out, we put sand
around him to keep him warm.

211
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,879
Well, I assume the, uh, happy couple
isn't up yet?

212
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,964
Did you guys hear them last night?

213
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,258
Oh, yeah. I don't know
what they were doing...

214
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,969
...but sea turtles actually came up
to the house.

215
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,307
- Good morning.
- Hey.

216
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,058
- How'd everybody sleep?
- Great.

217
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,477
Like a log.

218
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,061
Us too.

219
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,523
I'm going for a walk.

220
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,323
Good morning. Nice breasts, by the way.

221
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,627
Hey, what happened to you?

222
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,464
Oh, uh, nothing. I just felt like
hanging out here and reading.

223
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,424
Oh, the water was so great.

224
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,302
We jumped off this pier
and my suit came off.

225
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,305
Oh. Sorry I missed that.

226
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,641
Joey and Chandler sure are funny.

227
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,518
Oh, ha, ha.

228
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,562
I think I brought back half the beach
in my hair.

229
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,524
It was so much easier
when I used to shave my head.

230
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,863
You know, I gotta tell you...

231
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,908
...I just loved your look
when you were bald.

232
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,452
- Really?
- Oh.

233
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,288
Because I think about shaving it
all off again sometimes.

234
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,457
- Really?
- Yeah.

235
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,835
I mean, you definitely should do that.

236
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,129
- You know what? I should do it.
- Yeah.

237
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,465
You know what? Thank you, Rachel.
You are so cool.

238
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,426
Oh, stop. Go on.

239
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,346
- Now, go shave that head.
- All right.

240
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,109
What's the matter, Pheebs?

241
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,736
She canceled.
My namesake canceled on me.

242
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,573
- What?
- She claims she had to go out of town.

243
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,991
She's avoiding me.

244
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,118
She doesn't want to tell me
where my father is.

245
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,536
She knows and she won't tell.

246
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,872
Aw, Pheebs, that sucks.

247
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,751
Yeah, well, don't
"Aw, Pheebs, that sucks" me yet.

248
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,962
- Where are you going?
- Well, she's out of town.

249
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,507
So there's gotta be something in her house
that tells me where my father is.

250
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,927
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that
"breaking and entering."

251
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,222
- Well, are any of those people here?
- Oh, no.

252
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,559
Okay. Look, I'll do something nice,
okay?

253
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,021
I'll fill her ice trays. Good?

254
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,940
Hey, everybody.

255
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,483
Wow. Wow!

256
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,031
Ha, look what you did.

257
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:13,328
- You wanna touch it?
- No, but it's great.

258
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,079
Come on, touch it.

259
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,165
Okay.

260
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,462
You can feel all the bones
in your skull.

261
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,929
- Hi.
- Hi.

262
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,474
I was having a little chat with Bonnie,
and, uh, guess what.

263
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,267
She happened to bring up, you know...

264
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,978
...who was behind the whole, um,
head-shaving idea.

265
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,023
And now, who was it? Oh, that's right.
That's right, it was you.

266
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,944
That was her idea.

267
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,863
I just gave her a nudge.

268
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,366
She said you gave her the razor.

269
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,868
- Yo.
- Hey.

270
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,287
So anyone up for a midnight dip
in the ocean?

271
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,623
- Uh, no, I'm good.
- No, thanks.

272
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,793
- Okay, I'll see you in a bit.
- Okay, have fun. Bye.

273
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,839
Come on, see?
She doesn't look that bad.

274
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:10,426
You can see the moonlight
bouncing off her head.

275
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,430
- What the hell were you thinking?
- I don't know.

276
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,766
You don't know?
Rach, you balded my girlfriend.

277
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,227
All right. Ross.

278
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,439
Do you think it's easy for me
to see you with somebody else?

279
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,650
You know what?
You're the one who ended it.

280
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,862
Yeah, because I was mad at you.
Not because I stopped loving you.

281
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,075
- You still love me?
- No.

282
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,662
You still love me.

283
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,331
Yeah, so? You love me.

284
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,291
No... Mm.

285
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,046
What does this mean? What do you...?

286
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:50,049
I mean, do you want
to get back together?

287
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,719
No. Maybe.

288
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,512
I don't know.

289
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,307
Ross...

290
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,896
I still can't forgive you for what you did.

291
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,442
I just... But sometimes when I'm with you,
I just feel so...

292
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,735
What?

293
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,988
I just... I feel...

294
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,575
- I just...
- What?

295
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,702
I feel...

296
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,420
No. I don't care.

297
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:31,799
I'm not playing one-on-one strip poker
with you for practice.

298
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,052
But I made cards.

299
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,888
Well.

300
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,473
Good night.

301
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,100
I'm going upstairs.

302
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,227
- Good night.
- Night.

303
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,320
Wanna play strip poker for practice?

304
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,170
Ow.

305
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,547
My ass.

306
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,304
Okay.

307
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,681
Okay, good.

308
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,726
Ooh. Shh.

309
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,237
Shh, shh.

310
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,495
Shh.

311
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,046
- Aah!
- No! Oh, it's me. It's me.

312
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,299
- I didn't wanna make any noise.
- Then don't break in.

313
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,637
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing here?

314
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,850
I came to fill your ice-cube tray.

315
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,561
What?

316
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,355
Um, okay.

317
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,358
Okay, look. Huh. Ahem.

318
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:16,654
I took this picture from your fridge, okay?
Because I know that this is my father.

319
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,241
Yeah, this is Frank Buffay, and you
were standing right there next to him.

320
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,202
Now, look, I deserve to know
where I came from.

321
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,581
All right? So if you can help me
find my father, then you should.

322
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,000
Otherwise, you're just mean.

323
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,629
So just tell me the truth.

324
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,423
All right.

325
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:40,052
The man in that picture
is Chuck Mangione.

326
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,974
My father is Chuck Mangione?

327
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,893
No, no. That's just Chuck Mangione.

328
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,437
I sold him a house last year.

329
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,816
And I'm very sorry, but I really don't
know where your father is.

330
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,735
And that's the truth.

331
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,570
Oh.

332
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,406
But, um, you're right.

333
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,951
I think that a person should know
where they come from.

334
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,121
Which is why I, uh...

335
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,374
Uh...

336
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,629
Okay...

337
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,340
I'm your mother.

338
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,677
Huh?

339
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:25,848
You know, I wanted to tell you yesterday,
but I just...

340
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,642
I felt all floopy, and...

341
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,064
I'm telling you.
You guys are getting back together.

342
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,608
That's not true.
She doesn't even know what she wants.

343
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,818
Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.

344
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:41,364
Okay, well, then you gotta back away.
You don't need that kind of hurt.

345
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,366
Take it from a guy who's...

346
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,953
...never had a long-term relationship.

347
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:52,208
I know, but I really want to go
up there and finish that kiss.

348
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,668
- Hey.
- Aah.

349
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,963
You guys, the water is great.
You should really go in.

350
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,340
Oh, uh, no, thanks. I just had an M&M.

351
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,801
Okay. Well, good night.

352
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,427
Good night.

353
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,431
- Don't be too long.
- Okey-dokey.

354
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,102
There is not one hair on that head.

355
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,189
Hey, it'll grow back, right?
And she's really fun, and she's cool.

356
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,025
And I'm finally moving on.

357
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,779
I mean, getting over Rachel
was so, ugh, you know?

358
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,907
You know, I'm finally feeling sane again.
And now if I go up there...

359
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,201
...and I kiss her and...

360
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,578
God, I want to kiss her.

361
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,539
And it doesn't work out, right?

362
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,958
Do I really wanna put myself
through that again?

363
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,668
So let me get this straight.

364
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,295
If you go with Bonnie tonight...

365
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,298
...you're doing the smart,
healthy thing and moving on.

366
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,465
- Yeah.
- Right?

367
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,302
And if you go with Rachel,
Bonnie's free tonight?

368
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,900
Hi.

369
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,077
Hi there.

370
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,706
That's that weird voice again.

371
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,499
Let me try it again.

372
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,794
You're gonna wanna date this next guy,
I swear. Okay, come on.

373
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,259
Hi, I'm Dorf.

374
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,263
Your date for the evening.

375
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:35,353
Oh, come on. Dorf on dating?
That's good stuff.
