1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,003
Bye-bye.

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,505
I just got reservations
at Michelle's...

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,966
...and tickets to The Music Man
to celebrate...

4
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,677
...our first holiday
as a betrothed couple.

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,055
- "Betrothed."
- Betrothed couple.

6
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,141
- Hey.
- Hi.

7
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:20,185
- Aw.
- Oh.

8
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,065
- Pheebs?
Uh-huh?

9
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,817
Skull?

10
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,318
Oh. Yeah, it's my mom's.

11
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,070
Oh, my God!

12
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,781
No, no, no. It's not my mom.

13
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,616
It belonged to my mom.

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,287
She used to put it out
every Christmas...

15
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:42,791
...to remind us that even though
it's Christmas, people still die.

16
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:46,336
And you can put candy in it.

17
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,716
- Hey.
- Hey.

18
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:51,925
Licorice?

19
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,137
Sure. Ha, ha.

20
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:58,849
- I get Ben for the holidays this year.
- That's great!

21
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,435
- Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
- Nope.

22
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,437
I know Susan does every year.

23
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,523
I want to take this year
to teach him about Hanukkah.

24
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,150
And maybe I could teach Ben...

25
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,153
...about the Christmas skull
and how people die.

26
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,490
You may need to use this year
to teach Ben about Phoebe.

27
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,949
Mm.

28
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,788
Hey.

29
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,629
- Did you know he was in there?
- No.

30
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,883
- How long have we been home?
- About half an hour.

31
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,343
Lovely.

32
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,220
You know what I was thinking?
When we get married, will you, uh...

33
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,013
...change your name to "Bing"?

34
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,558
No.

35
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:24,977
Why not?

36
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,729
Bing's weird.

37
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,899
Oh, hey, you guys.

38
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,818
Hey.

39
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,236
Guess what?

40
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,239
My landlord just called.
My apartment's gonna be ready soon.

41
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,782
I guess I'll be moving out.

42
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,659
Aw, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you.

43
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,744
Yes, you will be very sad.

44
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,500
- I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
- Oh. You'll be living together again?

45
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,378
- Why not?
- She's having so much fun with Joey...

46
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,881
...I assumed she'd still
be living with him.

47
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,717
Why do you think
she's having so much fun?

48
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,219
No reason, except she...

49
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,180
...told me.

50
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,099
She said she didn't want
to live with me?

51
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,019
No. No, she didn't say that.

52
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,355
I think you should talk to Monica now.

53
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,151
Phoebe, I'm sure
she wants to live with you.

54
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,861
You're absolutely sure?

55
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,530
No, but I'll bet she probably does.

56
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,823
Oh, probably?

57
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,325
I don't like that word.

58
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:26,246
I know what "probably" really means.
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.

59
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,749
"Oh, your mom
probably won't kill herself."

60
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,711
You know. I'm sorry,
but I'm not hanging my hopes...

61
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,340
...of Rachel and I living together
on "probably."

62
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,134
You gotta take care of yourself
in this world.

63
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,845
History teaches us nothing.

64
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:47,017
Bing doesn't seem so weird now,
does it?

65
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,774
You're home.

66
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,651
Guess what Phoebe got me
for Christmas?

67
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,537
- Drums?
- No, drums!

68
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,171
Could we get
two burritos to go, please? Ha, ha.

69
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:22,219
I'm sorry. But not that sorry,
you don't have to live with it.

70
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,888
Um, we have a reservation under Bing.

71
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:28,475
Okay, we'll have a table for you
in about 45 minutes.

72
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,645
We have tickets
to The Music Man at 8.

73
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,648
I'm sorry.
Christmas is a very busy time, sir.

74
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,109
Is this because of the burrito thing?

75
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,948
- You need to give him money.
- It was a joke!

76
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,785
To get a table. Places like this
are always shaking you down.

77
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,455
- Everybody wants a payoff.
- All right, calm down, O'Malley.

78
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,711
- I'll slip him some money.
- But you've got to be smooth.

79
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,130
Hey, I can be smooth.

80
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,387
We're in a hurry.
If you could get us a table...

81
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,306
...a bit quicker, I'd appreciate it.

82
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,725
- Of course, sir.
- Okay.

83
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,646
- How'd it go?
- Had the money in the wrong hand.

84
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:22,988
You don't feel...

85
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,823
...like you're gonna throw up?
- No.

86
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,617
Well, I do. So let's...

87
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,330
So, Ben, you, uh...

88
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,999
You know what holiday is coming up?

89
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,208
Christmas.

90
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,587
Yeah, and you know what
other holiday is coming up?

91
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,130
Christmas Eve.

92
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,092
Yes, but also...

93
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,054
Hanukkah!

94
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:52,059
See, you're part Jewish
and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.

95
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,936
Santa has reindeers that can fly.

96
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,563
Right, um, but on Hanukkah...

97
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,191
Hanukkah is a celebration
of a miracle.

98
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,070
Years and years ago there were
these people called the Maccabees.

99
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,654
Jingle bells, jingle bells

100
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,615
Okay, that's right. Yes...

101
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,534
...but on Hanukkah, we sing, uh:

102
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,579
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel
I made you out of clay

103
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,415
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

104
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,251
Ha, ha. Okay, it's not a contest.

105
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,128
When is Santa coming?

106
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,883
How about this year,
instead of Santa...

107
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,803
...we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?

108
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,888
No Santa?

109
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,681
Was I bad?

110
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,936
No, no, no, you weren't bad.
You've been very good, Ben.

111
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,481
- Santa's mad at me.
- No, hey, hey, come on.

112
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,067
Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay?

113
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,444
You're his favorite little guy.

114
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,113
So Santa's coming?

115
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,908
Yes!

116
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,785
Santa's coming.

117
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,875
It's easy. Just keep it casual.

118
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:02,587
Shake his hand and give him the money.

119
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,882
- How do you know so much about this?
- I don't know.

120
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,718
Richard used to do it, didn't he?

121
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,930
We'd be eating our soup right now.

122
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,392
Mustached bastard.

123
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,313
Those people just left. Come on.
Quick, give him the money.

124
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:21,940
Excuse me.

125
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,408
We're in a bit of a hurry.
Can we please?

126
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,410
Ah-ha-ha-ha.

127
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,633
Ha!

128
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,179
So you like the drums.

129
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,306
That's great.

130
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,185
I was worried that
they would create maybe...

131
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,687
...an unbearable living situation.

132
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:04,941
But, okay, well, apparently not.
So, yay!

133
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,360
Hey, we already learned a song.

134
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,864
Ready? One, two, three, four.

135
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,534
Tequila!

136
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,622
That's fun.

137
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,505
Here you go.

138
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,132
Thank you, Gunther.
Put her there.

139
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,429
Definitely not easier with coins.

140
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,098
Thank you.

141
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,061
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

142
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,481
Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.

143
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,108
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

144
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:51,112
If you want to get Joey a gift
that disrupts the entire building...

145
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,406
...why not something more subtle...

146
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,866
...like a wrecking ball...

147
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,578
...or a vial of smallpox
to release in the hallway?

148
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,706
It's not just the drum noise.
Every five minutes...

149
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,750
...Joey throws his sticks
in the air...

150
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:07,379
...and I have to hear:
"Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye!"

151
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,173
- I mean, it's so annoying.
- Yes, thank you.

152
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:14,970
You see, this is how normal people
are supposed to react to drums.

153
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,015
You got Joey drums to annoy Rachel...

154
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,643
...so she wouldn't want
to live there anymore?

155
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,937
Maybe on some level.

156
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,657
You could just not throw the sticks
up in the air.

157
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,867
What is rock 'n' roll about that?

158
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,914
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.

159
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,668
Hold it!
Before you tell me what it is...

160
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,798
Okay, what is it?

161
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,133
It's a...

162
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,593
...tarantula!

163
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,014
Oh.

164
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,977
God, Rachel, I'm sorry.
What was I thinking...

165
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,314
...giving Joey this big, gross,
scary spider...

166
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:11,234
...in such a poorly constructed cage?

167
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,487
What are you talking about?
I love them.

168
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:20,535
I had a tarantula when I was a kid.
But it died because my cat ate it.

169
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,371
And then my cat died.

170
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,665
But, Joey, isn't this cool?

171
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,585
Is it on me?
I feel like it's on me. I got...

172
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,089
Oh, isn't that adorable?

173
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,551
- Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
- Oh.

174
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,011
He's so adorable.

175
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,554
He's so much fun.

176
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,390
I'm glad you're having
so much fun here.

177
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,059
Whoa. Wait a minute.

178
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,268
What's the matter?

179
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,604
Our apartment is ready.

180
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:52,359
And that makes you angry because?

181
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,153
Because you'd rather
live here with Joey.

182
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,031
- Where did you get that?
- Monica and Chandler...

183
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,575
...said you were having
so much fun here...

184
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:05,497
...and apparently no amount of drums
or tarantulas is gonna change that.

185
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,751
Did you get all this stuff for Joey...

186
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,253
...to try to drive me out
of the apartment?

187
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,924
You might as well
have gotten him a fish.

188
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,385
You know how fish freak me out.

189
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,221
Fish.

190
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:25,350
But it wouldn't have mattered.
We're gonna live together.

191
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,435
That's the deal.

192
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,896
Yes, but I wanted you to want
to live with me.

193
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,857
But if you're having
so much fun over here...

194
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,193
Oh. It's so much more fun with you.

195
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,154
- We did have fun, didn't we?
- We did.

196
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,491
They say if we want,
we could see it tonight.

197
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,785
- I would love to.
- Yay, okay!

198
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,955
- Good, good, good.
- Great. All right. Good.

199
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,916
And Monica asked me
to make the drumming stop.

200
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,712
Um, ahem.

201
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,673
Done.

202
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,763
Hey.

203
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,266
Hello, sir.
You here to return those pants?

204
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,816
No, these are my pants.

205
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,443
Oh.

206
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,153
Okay.

207
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:22,407
- How can I help you?
- Um, do you have a Santa outfit left?

208
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,784
Two days before Christmas?
Sorry, man.

209
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,955
Okay, look.
Do you have anything, uh, Christmas-y?

210
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,000
I promised my son, and I really
don't want to disappoint him.

211
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:36,337
Um, come on,
you gotta have something.

212
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,507
I'm the Holiday Armadillo!

213
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,636
I'm a friend of Santa's...

214
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,639
...and he sent me here to wish you...

215
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:50,059
...a merry Christmas!

216
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:54,397
What happened to Santa,
Holiday Armadillo?

217
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,984
Santa was unavailable...

218
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,112
...so close to Christmas.

219
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,656
Come in, have a seat.

220
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:07,786
You must be exhausted,
coming all the way from Texas.

221
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,208
- Texas?
- That's right, Ben.

222
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,168
I'm Santa's representative...

223
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:19,255
...for all the Southern states.

224
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,759
And Mexico!

225
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,720
But Santa sent me here...

226
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,557
...to give you these presents, Ben.

227
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:33,269
Maybe the lady will help me
with these presents.

228
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,702
Wow, thanks!

229
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,329
You're welcome, Ben.

230
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,415
Merry Christmas. Ooh.

231
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,211
And happy Hanukkah!

232
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,674
Are you for Hanukkah too?
Because I'm part Jewish.

233
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,177
You are? Me too.

234
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:10,974
Because armadillos
also wandered in the desert?

235
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,228
You want to wander in the hall?

236
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,107
Oh. Hey, Ben!

237
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,484
What if the Holiday Armadillo...

238
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,280
...told you all about
the Festival of Lights?

239
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,531
Cool!

240
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,283
Come on, Ben.

241
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,955
Years and years ago...

242
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,416
...there were these people called...

243
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,084
...the Maccabees!

244
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,796
Ho-ho-ho. Merry Christmas!

245
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,632
Santa!

246
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,217
Hey.

247
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,054
What are you doing here, Santa?

248
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,809
Well, I'm here to see
my old buddy, Ben.

249
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,186
What are you doing here...

250
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:01,190
...Weird Turtle Man?

251
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,945
I'm the Holiday Armadillo...

252
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,532
...your part-Jewish friend.

253
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,787
You sent me here
to give Ben some presents.

254
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,873
Remember?

255
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,250
What?

256
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,464
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?

257
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,341
You bet I did, Ben.

258
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,551
Put her there.

259
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:37,936
Well, it would have worked this time
if his hands weren't so damn small.

260
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,274
Ho-ho-ho.

261
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,109
Ben, come open more presents.

262
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,196
Santa, the armadillo and I
will have a talk in the kitchen.

263
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,491
There's a sentence
I never thought I'd say.

264
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,702
What are you doing?

265
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,122
You said you were having trouble
finding a Santa costume...

266
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,792
...so I borrowed one
from a guy at work.

267
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,586
Thank you, but you gotta leave.

268
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,254
- Why?
- Because...

269
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,132
...I'm finally getting him excited
about Hanukkah...

270
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,842
...and you're wrecking it.

271
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,138
But I didn't get to shake my belly
like a bowlful of jelly.

272
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:21,104
I'm sorry, Chandler,
but this is really important to me.

273
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:25,358
Fine, I'll give the suit back.

274
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:29,529
Hey, you think you can keep it
another night?

275
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,741
Santa, really?

276
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,743
Yeah, is that okay?

277
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,580
Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?

278
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,127
- No.
- Then it's okay!

279
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,588
Okay, Ben. Santa has to go.

280
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,340
Say goodbye.

281
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,176
No, why does he have to go?

282
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:56,639
Because if Santa and the Holiday...

283
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,808
...Armadillo...

284
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,312
...are ever in the same room
for too long...

285
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,649
...the universe will implode!

286
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,611
Merry Christmas!

287
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,908
No, why can't the armadillo leave?
I want Santa.

288
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,996
Fine, I give up. Santa...

289
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,749
Santa can stay!

290
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,710
Well, I'll stay...

291
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,464
...but only because I want to hear
about Hanukkah.

292
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,800
Ben, will you sit here with Santa...

293
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,219
...and learn about Hanukkah?

294
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,513
Okay, Santa.

295
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,058
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

296
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,351
All right, it's time...

297
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,855
...for the story of Hanukkah.

298
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,149
Years and years ago...

299
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:52,195
...there were these people
called the Maccabees!

300
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,864
Merry Christmas!

301
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,169
Oh, wow, look at this place!

302
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,548
Oh, this is terrible.

303
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,217
They've made so many changes...

304
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,762
...I can't even feel
my grandmother's presence anymore.

305
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,473
Oh, new sconces!

306
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,184
- Oh, my God!
- What?

307
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:27,480
Remember, uh, how you told me
your grandmother put up that wall...

308
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,941
...to make that into two bedrooms?
- Yeah.

309
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,401
And that the landlord
might find out...

310
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,737
...and then tear it down?
- Yeah?

311
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,032
Do you really not know
where I'm going?

312
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,827
It left. It's one huge room.

313
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,079
Oh, no!

314
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,041
Wow!

315
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,544
See?

316
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,421
I guess we'll have to
put the wall back up.

317
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:56,634
- You can't because of the new skylight.
- There's a skylight?

318
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,761
Wow!

319
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:03,099
Oh. So should we start looking
for a new place?

320
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,937
You know, I'm sensing...

321
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:12,191
...that, um, my grandmother
would not be comfortable with that.

322
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,902
Oh, yeah?

323
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,072
Starting to feel her again there,
are we?

324
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,992
- A little bit. Yeah.
- Yeah.

325
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:25,872
Is your grandmother maybe saying
that you should live here alone?

326
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,291
You heard it too? You have the gift.

327
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,878
Phoebe, it's okay.

328
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,255
I like living with Joey.

329
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,883
- Are you sure?
- Please. I hate packing...

330
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,593
...it's closer to work.

331
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,053
And we do have fun.

332
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:45,433
Although, I'm really gonna miss
living with you.

333
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,935
- Oh, me too.
- I know.

334
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,689
Oh. Did you hear that?

335
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,066
I'm getting something
from your grandmother.

336
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,570
She said since you get to keep
the one-bedroom apartment...

337
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:01,282
...you should give Rachel
the purple chair.

338
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,953
No, I do not hear that.

339
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,625
And the miracle was that
that little bit of oil...

340
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:14,670
...that should have lasted
just one day, burned for...

341
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,797
- Eight whole days.
- That's right.

342
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:20,843
And that's why we celebrate
Hanukkah today. The end.

343
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,054
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

344
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,472
My favorite part...

345
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:29,268
...was when Superman
flew all the Jews out of Egypt.

346
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:37,944
The armadillo was actually
not so thrilled about that part.

347
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,072
Okay, Ben, it's time to light...

348
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,408
...the Hanukkah candles!

349
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,202
Ho-ho-ho.

350
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,252
Hey.

351
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,795
- Oh.
- Wow.

352
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,422
Looks like the Easter Bunny's
funeral in here.

353
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,886
Come on, come on.
We're lighting the candles.

354
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,638
Oh, oh.

355
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,935
I understand why Superman is here...

356
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,939
...but why is there a porcupine
at the Easter Bunny's funeral?

357
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,658
- You get it?
- I got it.

358
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,702
Back in the cage?

359
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,913
It's back in the cage.

360
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,957
Is the cage closed?

361
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,920
Joey, will you just come out here
and stop being such a baby?
