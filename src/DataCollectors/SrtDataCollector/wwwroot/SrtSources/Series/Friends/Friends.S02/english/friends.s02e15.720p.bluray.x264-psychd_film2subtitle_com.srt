1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,504
All right, no peeking. No peeking.

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,548
No peeking. No peeking!

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:11,552
All right, all right, but you better be
wearing clothes when I open my eyes.

4
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,098
All right. Open your eyes!

5
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:24,148
Sweet mother of all
that is good and pure.

6
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,109
Huh? Days of our Lives
picked up my option!

7
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,903
- Congratulations!
- I know! Ha-ha-ha.

8
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:34,408
Now we can watch Green Acres
the way it was meant to be seen.

9
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:38,203
So, uh, which one is mine?

10
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:42,249
Whichever one you want, man.
Whichever one you want!

11
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,044
Not that one.

12
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,216
Oh, yes!

13
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,887
Oh, yeah! That's the stuff.

14
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,222
Oh.

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,267
- Do we dare?
- We dare.

16
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,270
Oh.

17
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,315
Oh!

18
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,699
I can't believe two cows
made the ultimate sacrifice...

19
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,369
...so you could watch TV
with your feet up.

20
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,247
No, they were chair-shaped cows.

21
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,625
They never would have survived
in the wild.

22
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:07,918
This screen is amazing.

23
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,171
- Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
Uh-huh.

24
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,010
Rose Marie really belongs on
a smaller screen, doesn't she?

25
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,887
- Hi, you guys.
Hey.

26
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,347
Hey.

27
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,350
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.

28
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,479
Whoa, hey, whoa.
- Oh.

29
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,023
So, uh, how was your day?

30
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,692
Oh, you know, pretty much the usual.

31
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,778
Uh, sun shining, birds chirping.

32
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,155
Really? Mine too.

33
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,157
Hey, cool! Mine too!

34
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,368
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,288
I gotta get to the museum. So, um...

36
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,166
- I'll see you tonight?
- Okay.

37
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,129
Oh.

38
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,423
Bye, guys!

39
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,674
Bye.
Bye.

40
00:02:57,093 --> 00:03:00,137
- Tonight?
Hey, whoa.

41
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,473
- What's tonight?
- It is our first official date.

42
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,267
Our first date.

43
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,478
Uh, ha, ha. Hello?

44
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,772
Hi.

45
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,194
Tonight? You're supposed to waitress
for me? My catering thing?

46
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,697
- Any of that trigger anything?
- Oh, God, Monica. I forgot!

47
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,699
This is our first date.

48
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,952
- Yes, but my mom got me this job.
- I can be a waitress!

49
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,414
Thank you, thank you.
See? Phoebe! Phoebe!

50
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,041
- Really, Pheebs?
- Uh-huh.

51
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,709
You'd have to be an actual waitress.

52
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,754
This can't be like your
"I can be a bear cub" thing.

53
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,423
I can be a waitress. Okay, watch this.

54
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,884
Um, give me two number ones,
86 the bacon...

55
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,969
...one Adam and Eve on a raft
and wreck them!

56
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,319
It's James Bond!

57
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,157
- Sorry we're late.
- That's okay. Come on in.

58
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,827
Um, I'm sorry, is Monica Geller coming?
I was told she was.

59
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,038
Dr. Burke, it's me.

60
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,581
Monica?

61
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,583
My God! You used to be so...

62
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,420
I mean, you've...
You must have lost like...

63
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,801
- You look great.
- Thank you.

64
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,761
This is Phoebe.
She'll be helping me.

65
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,680
Hi, Phoebe. Nice to meet you.

66
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,562
So how you been?
- Great. How have you been?

67
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,982
Oh, obviously you know
Barbara and I split up...

68
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,484
...or you wouldn't do the head tilt.

69
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,986
The head tilt?

70
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,363
Since the divorce,
everybody asks how I am...

71
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,491
...with a sympathetic head tilt.
"How you doing? You okay?"

72
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,909
Oh.

73
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,452
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

74
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,579
It's fine. Believe me, I do it too.

75
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:54,459
I always answer with the
"I'm okay" head bob. "I'm okay. "

76
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,671
"You're sure?" "Yeah, I'm fine. "

77
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,424
I gotta set up the music.
I got a new CD changer.

78
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,760
Of course, the divorce only left me
with four CDs to change.

79
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,555
Oh, that's too bad.

80
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,849
I'll survive.

81
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,269
Ward. With a reverse.

82
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,605
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both.

83
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,607
But listen...

84
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,444
...don't ring the buzzer for 19.

85
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,322
Ring 20. Geller/Green.

86
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,241
They'll let you in, okay?

87
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,872
If you buzz our door,
there's no tip for you.

88
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,583
Okay, thanks.

89
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,588
Pizza's on the way.
I told you we wouldn't have to get up.

90
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,924
What if we have to pee?

91
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,347
I'll cancel the sodas.

92
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,394
Get back out there. It's your party!

93
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,731
But they're so dull.
They're all ophthalmologists.

94
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,649
You're an ophthalmologist.

95
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,111
Because my parents wanted me to be.
I wanted to be a sheriff.

96
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,367
Ha, ha. That's funny.
Cadillac, cataract. I get it.

97
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,660
But you stay out there!

98
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,538
- You see?
- All right, I tell you what.

99
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,459
I'll come get you in five minutes with
some sort of, um, kebob emergency.

100
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,710
Okay.

101
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,129
Ah. Better.

102
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,382
Oh, God, here we go.

103
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,509
Hey, want to see them go nuts?

104
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,344
Watch this.

105
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,805
Who needs glasses?

106
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,190
- You are so smitten.
- I am not!

107
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,318
Oh, you are so much
the smitten kitten.

108
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,153
Oh.

109
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,072
- You should ask him out.
- Dr. Burke?

110
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:51,743
I don't think so.
I mean, like, he's a grown-up.

111
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,914
So? You two are totally into each other.

112
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,751
He's a friend of my parents.
He's like 20 years older than me.

113
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,170
So you're never gonna see him again?

114
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,756
Not never.

115
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,218
I'm gonna see him tomorrow
at my eye appointment.

116
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,556
- Didn't you just get your eyes checked?
- Yeah, but, you know, uh...

117
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:17,144
...27 is a dangerous eye age.

118
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:26,319
I'm not saying it was a bad movie.
I'm just saying it was a little...

119
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,863
...hard to follow.

120
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,282
I told you there'd be subtitles.

121
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,492
I know.

122
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,871
I just didn't want to wear
my glasses on our first date.

123
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,622
Oh.

124
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,089
Monica?

125
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,680
It would help when I'm kissing
if you didn't shout my sister's name.

126
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,016
- Honey, I'm just checking.
- Oh.

127
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,518
- Ahem. Monica?
- Mon?

128
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,853
- Monica?
Mon?

129
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,105
Monica?

130
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,843
What?

131
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,637
- What?
- I'm sorry.

132
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,932
I'm sorry. It's just, when you moved
your hands down to my butt...

133
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,810
...it was like,
"Whoa, Ross' hands are on my butt!"

134
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,229
Sorry.

135
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,773
And that's funny why?

136
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,734
Well, it's not. Uh...

137
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,153
I mean, I'm sorry.
I guess I'm just nervous.

138
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,405
I mean, it's you.

139
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,907
- You know, it's us.
- Mm.

140
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:58,203
I mean, we're crossing that line.
It's sort of a big thing.

141
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,582
Well, I know it's big.
I just didn't know it was ha-ha big.

142
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,209
Okay.

143
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,012
Okay, my hands were
nowhere near your butt.

144
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,848
I know, I know, I know!

145
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:22,018
I was thinking about when
they were there the last time.

146
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,980
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Okay, look! Whoa, I promise.

147
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,191
I'm good. I won't laugh anymore.
Put your hands back there.

148
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,611
No, see, now I can't, because, uh...

149
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,530
...I'm feeling too self-conscious.

150
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,657
- Just one cheek.
- No. Ha.

151
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,826
The moment's gone.

152
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,287
- I'll back up into your hands.
- That's romantic.

153
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,538
Touch it.
No.

154
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,415
Oh, come on, squeeze it.
No!

155
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,708
Rub it?
No.

156
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,377
Oh, come on!
Would you just grab my ass?

157
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,888
Wow, look at that. The car is on fire...

158
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:02,142
...yet somehow
its expensive paint job...

159
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,645
...is protected by the Miracle Wax.

160
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,358
You've got a Cheeto on your face, man.

161
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,489
Thanks.

162
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,825
- Hey.
- Hey.

163
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,285
Ah.

164
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,080
Aren't you supposed
to be out with Rachel?

165
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,499
That was 14 hours ago.

166
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,628
- So how'd it go?
- Well...

167
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,631
Have you ever been, you know,
fooling around with a girl...

168
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,593
...and, uh, she started laughing?

169
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,764
Yeah, but, uh, it was 1982...

170
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:44,434
...and my Flock of Seagulls haircut
was tickling her chin.

171
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,105
- She laughed at you?
- Yeah.

172
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,858
I've been wanting this
since ninth grade typing.

173
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,486
You know,
I just want it to be perfect...

174
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,156
...and right and...

175
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,868
Why isn't that laser beam
cutting through the paint?

176
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,872
- It's the Miracle Wax!
- It certainly is a miracle.

177
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,666
- Hi, you guys.
Hey.

178
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,501
- Hey.
Hi.

179
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,253
Listen, I was, um, thinking about...

180
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,672
Listen, can you guys speak up?

181
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:17,133
It's harder for us to hear you
when you lower your voice.

182
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,471
Okay, listen.

183
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,683
I'm sorry about last night.
I really want to make it up to you.

184
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,937
No. You know,
there's no need to make it up... How?

185
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:34,067
Well, I was thinking maybe a, um...
Ahem, a romantic dinner...

186
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,153
...with, um, candles and wine.

187
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,865
And then, uh, ahem,
maybe going back to my place...

188
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,660
...for, um, dessert.

189
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,870
Hmm.

190
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,580
That sounds...

191
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,416
...perfect? Heh.

192
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,719
- What's this?
- Would you get us a couple of beers?

193
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,601
I'm going to look into your eyes now.

194
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,894
Really?

195
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,063
Yeah, that's my job.

196
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,109
All right. Look up.

197
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,570
Look down.

198
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,281
Now, open your eyes and look down.

199
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,949
That's right.

200
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,160
Look into the light.

201
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,787
Now look at me.

202
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,713
Okay.

203
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:42,177
Your eyes look good.
Those are good eyes.

204
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,637
Good. They feel good.

205
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,264
In my head.

206
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,060
Um, so...

207
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,647
- It was great to see you.
- You too.

208
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,233
You too.

209
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,069
Okay, um...

210
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,822
Goodbye. Ha, ha.

211
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,617
- Drops!
- What?

212
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,620
Drops. Here, they're free.

213
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,375
Thanks. Uh, so...

214
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,919
I guess I better be going.

215
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,879
Oh, okay, yeah, I'll see you later.

216
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,589
- Thanks again.
- Oh.

217
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,926
Oh.

218
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,314
We have to get you lazy boys
out of these chairs.

219
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,692
Hey, whoa, hey, whoa.
- Oh, oh.

220
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,113
You should go outside and be with
the three-dimensional people.

221
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,450
No. Inside good.

222
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,870
Outside bad.

223
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,540
You guys are so pathetic.

224
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,333
Oh, Xanadu!

225
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,001
Oh!

226
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,297
She's one of us now.

227
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:03,842
- Hi, you guys.
- Hey.

228
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,677
- Hey.
- Hey.

229
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,721
We just wanted to stop by
and, uh, say good night.

230
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,765
Good night.

231
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,142
They won't even turn their heads.

232
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,563
All right, you guys.
I'm taking off my shirt.

233
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,404
No, she's lying.

234
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:30,285
Stop sending food to our apartment!

235
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,328
Why are you dressed up?

236
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,581
You're not the only one
who has a date.

237
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,333
- What? You have a date? Who with?
- No one.

238
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,253
- Come on, what's his name?
- Nothing.

239
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,338
Come on, tell me.

240
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,800
All right, but I'm very excited
about this, okay?

241
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,053
So promise you won't get
big-brothery and judgmental.

242
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,680
I promise. What?

243
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,141
- It's Richard Burke.
- Who's Richard Burke?

244
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,976
Is that Dr...? Dr. Burke?

245
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,272
You have a date with Dr. Burke?
Why? Why? Why...

246
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,941
...should that bother me?

247
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,027
I love that man. He's like, uh...

248
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,738
...a brother to Dad.

249
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,489
Well, for your information...

250
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:12,327
...he is the brightest, most sophisticated,
sexiest man I've ever been with.

251
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,786
Dr. Burke is sexy?

252
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,038
Oh, God!

253
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,956
Absolutely!

254
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,918
Damn!

255
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,253
It's the museum again. Can I...? Oh.

256
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,924
- You know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.
- When?

257
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:30,386
When I was, um, 7, I crashed my bike
right out in front of his house...

258
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,307
...and to stop me from crying,
he kissed me right here.

259
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,602
- Oh, you are so lucky!
- I know. Ha-ha-ha.

260
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:41,397
Australopithecus isn't supposed
to be in that display.

261
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,316
No, no.

262
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:47,904
No, Homo habilis was erect.
Australopithecus was never fully erect.

263
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,239
Well, maybe he was nervous.

264
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,707
Oh, look! I can't believe this!

265
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,087
Homo habilis can't use tools yet,
and they've got him with clay pots?

266
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,923
Why don't they just
give him a microwave? Heh.

267
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,134
I'm sorry this is taking so long.

268
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,680
You know, I... It's longer than I expected.
We will have dinner.

269
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,391
- That's okay. It's fine.
- Karl!

270
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,311
Oh, God.

271
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,702
- Wow! Is that Michelle?
- Yep.

272
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,538
I've not seen her since
high-school graduation.

273
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,749
Oh, my God, that night she got so dru...

274
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,503
Emotional.

275
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,214
- You know, she's having another baby.
- Mm.

276
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,427
- I thought she just had one.
- No, no. Henry's almost 2.

277
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,638
And he's talking and everything. Here.

278
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,889
Aw.

279
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,727
The other day he told me he liked me
better than his other grandpa.

280
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:04,272
In all fairness,
his other grandpa's a drunk, but still...

281
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:09,152
Whoa. You're a grandpa.

282
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,322
Yeah.

283
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,121
Are we nuts here?

284
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,373
I don't know. Maybe.

285
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:27,420
I mean, I'm dating a man
whose pool I once peed in.

286
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,173
I didn't need to know that.

287
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,468
I guess 21 years is a lot.

288
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:38,681
I mean, hell, I'm a whole person
who can drink older than you.

289
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,601
Yeah.

290
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,605
So...

291
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,487
- So maybe we should just...
- Yeah.

292
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,405
Yeah.

293
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,407
Maybe...

294
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,370
Wow.

295
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,999
This really sucks.

296
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,376
Yeah, it sure does.

297
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,172
Ah.

298
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:28,523
Uh, we don't really have to decide
anything right now, do we?

299
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,484
No, there's no rush or anything.

300
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:36,030
Pizza delivery!
- Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys!

301
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,368
- Rach?
- Oh.

302
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,994
- I'm done. Ah.
- Ahem.

303
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:45,873
Yeah, well, you know what?
So is, uh, Sorentino's.

304
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,544
I'm sorry. Let's, uh...
Why don't we find someplace else?

305
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:53,172
It's late. Everything will be closed.
We'll do it another night.

306
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,715
No, no, we won't.

307
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,175
We won't?

308
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,427
Come on.

309
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,596
Okay, that's dead, right?

310
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,684
- What is this? What are we doing?
- Shh.

311
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,271
- Do you want Cran-Apple or Cran-Grape?
- Grape.

312
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,066
Okay, now...

313
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,901
...sit.

314
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,696
Okay.

315
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,908
Oh, my God!

316
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,912
Billions ofyears ago,
Earth was...

317
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,207
Sorry.

318
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:35,089
Ah. So, what are we looking at?

319
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:40,136
Well, uh, you see that little cluster
of stars next to the big one?

320
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,055
That is Ursa Major.

321
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,601
- Really?
- No idea. It could be. Could be.

322
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,148
Listen, I'm sorry
I had to work tonight.

323
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,442
Oh, that's okay.

324
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,153
- You were worth the wait.
- Oh.

325
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,281
And I don't just mean tonight.

326
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:06,829
I never dreamed
That I'd meet somebody like you

327
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,581
Whoa.

328
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,708
You're not laughing.

329
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,003
This time it's not so funny.

330
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:24,597
No, I don't want to fall in love

331
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,600
This love is only gonna break your heart

332
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,770
Aah!
Oh!

333
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,147
Okay, loosen the knot.
Loosen the knot.

334
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,066
Sorry, sorry.

335
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,451
What a wicked game you play

336
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,538
Aah! Oh, God! Oh.

337
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,207
Honey?

338
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,167
Oh, that's okay.

339
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,044
What?

340
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,673
Oh, no. You just rolled
over the juice box.

341
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,808
Oh, thank God!

342
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:20,653
No, I don't want to fall in love

343
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:24,031
This love is only gonna break your heart

344
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,129
Hey.

345
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,339
Hey, you.

346
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:49,056
I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.

347
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,684
I know. It is pretty unbel...

348
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:56,272
What?
