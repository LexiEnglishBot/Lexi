1
00:00:02,781 --> 00:00:04,976
l'll get coffee.
Want anything, baby doll?

2
00:00:05,217 --> 00:00:06,548
l'm fine. Thanks.

3
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:09,050
l can't pull off ''baby doll,'' can l?

4
00:00:09,187 --> 00:00:12,679
No, l think we learned that
from the ''sugar lips'' incident.

5
00:00:13,358 --> 00:00:14,518
l'll make some tea.

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,018
How you doing, pumpkin?

7
00:00:19,698 --> 00:00:22,895
-So it's going well for you two?
-l know. Really well.

8
00:00:23,302 --> 00:00:25,793
l'm gonna ask Phoebe
to move in with me.

9
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:27,466
What do you think?

10
00:00:27,706 --> 00:00:29,697
lt's great!
When will you ask her?

11
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:31,705
Tonight. But don't say anything.

12
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,468
l swear. l promise.

13
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:34,976
l'm so excited!

14
00:00:35,213 --> 00:00:37,477
But listen, do not
get her flowers, okay?

15
00:00:37,716 --> 00:00:41,243
Because she cries when they die.
Then there's the whole funeral.

16
00:00:43,522 --> 00:00:46,855
-l'll see you after work, sweetie.
-Okay. Bye.

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,555
So, what movie should we see?

18
00:00:50,896 --> 00:00:53,364
Gary's gonna ask you
to move in with him!

19
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:55,822
What? Really?

20
00:00:56,034 --> 00:00:59,993
He made me promise not to tell,
but l couldn't hold it in any longer!

21
00:01:00,906 --> 00:01:02,032
l can't believe this.

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,676
Right? Because it's fast.
Because it's so fast. lt's fast.

23
00:01:06,778 --> 00:01:08,871
Relax. lt's Phoebe, not you.

24
00:01:09,748 --> 00:01:11,716
Good for you, Pheebs.
Way to go.

25
00:01:12,017 --> 00:01:13,848
No, but it is fast, isn't it?

26
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:18,222
-l like him, but l'm not ready.
-So, what are you gonna do?

27
00:01:18,423 --> 00:01:22,291
l don't know. l'll just handle it.
l'll ask you to talk to him!

28
00:01:23,028 --> 00:01:24,052
Me? Why me?

29
00:01:24,262 --> 00:01:26,287
Because you are
so afraid of commitment.

30
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:30,433
You talk to him. Make him scared
like you, make him a man.

31
00:01:31,236 --> 00:01:33,727
l'll try, but l'm not sure
what good it'd do.

32
00:01:33,972 --> 00:01:36,440
l'm less afraid of commitment
than l used to be.

33
00:01:36,642 --> 00:01:38,769
That is so sweet.

34
00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:42,141
Still terrified.
l'll take care of it.

35
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:50,487
The One With the Ball

36
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:39,296
Hey, Ross, is Staten lsland
really an island?

37
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:42,669
That's why they call it
Staten ''lsland.''

38
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:45,872
Oh, l thought it was
like Long lsland.

39
00:02:51,383 --> 00:02:52,816
Also an island.

40
00:02:54,653 --> 00:02:56,644
-What time is it?
-2:1 7.

41
00:02:57,723 --> 00:03:01,887
We haven't dropped
this ball for an hour.

42
00:03:02,027 --> 00:03:03,016
Are you serious?

43
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:05,925
l realized it a half-hour ago,
but l didn't say anything.

44
00:03:06,231 --> 00:03:08,324
l didn't wanna jinx it.

45
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:10,501
We are pretty good at this.

46
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:14,168
We totally forgot about lunch.

47
00:03:15,707 --> 00:03:18,369
That's the first time
l've ever missed a meal.

48
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:20,704
l think my pants are a little loose.

49
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,343
Hey, you guys. ls Monica here?

50
00:03:28,954 --> 00:03:31,514
l bought something.
l'm not sure she'll like it.

51
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:35,625
lt may seem crazy, but l've wanted
this since l was a little girl.

52
00:03:35,894 --> 00:03:37,794
You bought Shaun Cassidy!

53
00:03:38,797 --> 00:03:40,025
No. l wish!

54
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:41,596
Okay, you ready?

55
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:47,594
Check it out.

56
00:03:52,577 --> 00:03:53,771
What is it?

57
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:55,742
What the hell is that?

58
00:03:57,249 --> 00:03:58,443
lt's a cat.

59
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,981
That is not a cat!

60
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:02,579
Yes, it is!

61
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:05,085
Why is it inside out?

62
00:04:09,094 --> 00:04:10,322
Excuse me!

63
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:14,827
But this is a purebred,
show-quality sphinx cat.

64
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,591
How much did you pay for that?

65
00:04:17,803 --> 00:04:20,135
lt was extravagant,
but l got a good deal.

66
00:04:20,405 --> 00:04:22,236
-How much?
-Thousand bucks.

67
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:25,571
On a cat?

68
00:04:26,945 --> 00:04:28,276
lt's not a cat!

69
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:34,312
For a thousand dollars,
you'd think at least it'd come with hair.

70
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:36,880
Or something.

71
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:39,018
All right. Listen, ball boys.

72
00:04:39,324 --> 00:04:42,919
My grandma had one when l was little.
lt was the sweetest thing.

73
00:04:43,128 --> 00:04:46,256
lt would sit in my lap
and just purr all day long.

74
00:04:46,498 --> 00:04:49,331
l would drag a string
and it would chase it.

75
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:51,536
Free cats do that too, you know.

76
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:54,229
lt's not a cat!

77
00:04:54,673 --> 00:04:58,302
l'm really excited about this, okay?
l don't care what you think.

78
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,741
l'm gonna set up a litter box
for Mrs. Whiskerson.

79
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:05,543
What am l gonna call her?
Fluffy?

80
00:05:09,588 --> 00:05:13,991
Do you wanna get something to eat,
or see how long we can throw this ball?

81
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,989
The ball thing.

82
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,593
Wouldn't it be great if we could go
for two hours without dropping it?

83
00:05:24,936 --> 00:05:26,767
Yeah, it would!

84
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:29,530
Let's do it.

85
00:05:34,913 --> 00:05:36,346
l have to pee.

86
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:38,708
And Rachel's in the bathroom!

87
00:05:43,555 --> 00:05:45,250
Man, l didn't think we'd make it.

88
00:05:46,892 --> 00:05:48,223
l know.

89
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:50,417
Don't switch hands, okay?

90
00:05:58,703 --> 00:06:01,399
Hey, ladies.
What are you in here for?

91
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,902
What are you doing here?

92
00:06:07,112 --> 00:06:09,137
l am here to report a crime.

93
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:11,849
lt's a crime that
we don't spend time together.

94
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:12,972
What's up?

95
00:06:14,753 --> 00:06:18,814
You're thinking about moving in with
Phoebe, and l thought we should talk.

96
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,318
You know, man to...

97
00:06:20,558 --> 00:06:21,889
...well, me.

98
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:24,319
Sure, okay.

99
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,727
Are you crazy?

100
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,388
Are you insane?

101
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:32,626
lf you live with Phoebe, you two
are gonna be living together.

102
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:35,301
l considered that.
lt'd make me happy.

103
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,138
-You mean scared.
-No, l mean happy.

104
00:06:38,276 --> 00:06:40,403
Scared happy.

105
00:06:41,112 --> 00:06:42,272
What are you doing?

106
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,107
l'm trying to open your eyes!

107
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:47,114
lf you live with Phoebe,
she is always gonna be there.

108
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:50,320
You get home, she's there.
You go to bed, she's there.

109
00:06:50,588 --> 00:06:53,250
You wake up and, oh, yes, she's there.

110
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:55,358
l know. l can't wait!

111
00:06:56,428 --> 00:06:59,158
Were your parents happy or something?

112
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:03,532
l was lucky enough to find
someone that l really love.

113
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:06,861
l just want to be around her
as much as l can.

114
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,135
When you say it,
it doesn't sound so scary.

115
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:11,673
You know what l'm saying?

116
00:07:11,876 --> 00:07:13,605
Yeah, l think l do.

117
00:07:13,845 --> 00:07:14,971
You know what?

118
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,514
Move in with her. Move in right now.
Maybe l'll move in with Monica.

119
00:07:19,718 --> 00:07:22,152
No, it's too soon for you guys.

120
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:25,352
You're right about that.

121
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:31,155
When they found the remains
of the Mesozoic mastodon...

122
00:07:31,396 --> 00:07:33,990
...they discovered what appeared
to be the remains...

123
00:07:34,232 --> 00:07:37,668
...of a Paleozoic amphibian in its jaws.

124
00:07:38,837 --> 00:07:40,964
How did it get there?

125
00:07:43,008 --> 00:07:45,067
Maybe this should be more
of a quiet game.

126
00:07:47,746 --> 00:07:49,111
Hey, guys.

127
00:07:49,314 --> 00:07:51,043
l left my watch here last night.

128
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:53,474
-lt was here. Where is it?
-l don't know.

129
00:07:53,752 --> 00:07:55,083
l'm late for work.

130
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,311
How do you know?
You don't have a watch.

131
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:03,055
Can you stop throwing the ball
for one minute and help me find it?

132
00:08:03,328 --> 00:08:05,694
Oh, l don't know....
Yeah, can't do it.

133
00:08:11,236 --> 00:08:13,431
-What?
-Do not drop that ball.

134
00:08:13,671 --> 00:08:14,899
We haven't dropped it in....

135
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:17,107
Two hours, 27 minutes.

136
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:19,942
Really?

137
00:08:21,012 --> 00:08:23,037
l won't make it in to work today.

138
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:25,342
l don't feel very good.

139
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:32,853
For a second, l thought l was
feeling better, but l'm not.

140
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,557
Hey, Rach.

141
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:40,527
Check it out. Almost three hours
without dropping it.

142
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:44,030
Congratulations.
That's quite a waste of time.

143
00:08:47,072 --> 00:08:48,903
You have scratches all over you.

144
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,630
Well, it's my cat.

145
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:53,904
-Oh, l got a cat.
-l don't want a cat!

146
00:08:54,145 --> 00:08:56,545
Don't worry, it's not a cat.

147
00:08:57,615 --> 00:09:01,312
You guys, this cat is nothing
like my grandmother's cat.

148
00:09:01,553 --> 00:09:03,453
lt's not sweet.
lt's not cute.

149
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:08,818
l dragged a string, and it flipped out
and scratched the hell out of me.

150
00:09:10,295 --> 00:09:14,493
l know this sounds crazy,
but every time this cat hisses at me...

151
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:16,657
...l know it's saying, ''Rachel!''

152
00:09:23,441 --> 00:09:26,774
Doesn't sound as crazy
as paying $ 1 000 for a cat.

153
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:30,276
You paid $ 1 000 for a cat
when you owe me $300?

154
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:33,315
Well, l was gonna let you
play with it.

155
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:43,089
Did you talk to Gary
about moving in?

156
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:44,989
l think you should do it.

157
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:51,332
He's a great guy and he loves you
a lot. You are a very lucky lady.

158
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,360
You are useless!

159
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,008
Freaking out about commitment
is the one thing you can do...

160
00:09:58,276 --> 00:10:00,210
...and you can't even do that right!

161
00:10:00,445 --> 00:10:03,141
Sorry. lf he asked me,
l'd move in with him.

162
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:08,682
Get out of here, good-for-nothing.

163
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:12,913
Hey, Chandler.

164
00:10:13,057 --> 00:10:14,388
Hey, Gar.

165
00:10:16,027 --> 00:10:17,460
Hey, sweetie.

166
00:10:17,695 --> 00:10:19,788
Can l talk to you for a second?

167
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:23,993
You look pretty today.

168
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:25,827
Thanks. Okay.

169
00:10:27,405 --> 00:10:28,394
Here's the thing.

170
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,734
l really want this relationship
to move forward.

171
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,173
lf you're not moving forward,
you're moving backwards.

172
00:10:35,413 --> 00:10:38,382
No, if you're not moving forward,
you're staying still.

173
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,483
And staying still is good.
Watch this.

174
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:47,983
l want you to move in with me.

175
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:50,227
That is so sweet.

176
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:52,758
But don't you think
it's too soon?

177
00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:55,261
There's so much we don't know
about each other.

178
00:10:59,103 --> 00:11:00,934
Okay. l get it.

179
00:11:02,407 --> 00:11:06,104
l don't want us to jump into something
that we're not ready for.

180
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:12,611
l don't want
to mess up what we have.

181
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,217
l'm worried it's gonna
be a big mistake.

182
00:11:19,457 --> 00:11:22,620
Which is why my answer is yes!

183
00:11:24,095 --> 00:11:25,528
Really?

184
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:27,731
You're so happy.

185
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,901
Monica, stop throwing it so hard!

186
00:11:39,877 --> 00:11:41,538
We're on the same team!

187
00:11:43,548 --> 00:11:46,278
You guys have been doing this
for four hours?

188
00:11:46,484 --> 00:11:47,917
That's right, baby.

189
00:11:48,152 --> 00:11:50,780
-All right. Let me in.
-No, no! Don't do it!

190
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:52,989
What?

191
00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:55,753
He's a dropper.

192
00:11:57,729 --> 00:11:59,629
Oh, yeah. That's right!

193
00:11:59,964 --> 00:12:01,454
l'm not a dropper!

194
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:05,129
lt's really a three-person
game, you know?

195
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,239
lt's throwing and catching.

196
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:10,540
All right.

197
00:12:13,945 --> 00:12:15,537
Oh, it's so hard.

198
00:12:23,254 --> 00:12:25,654
Don't worry, guys.
lt's not a cat.

199
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:30,184
Oh, good God!

200
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:33,660
l give up. l don't know what
l'm gonna do with this thing.

201
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,258
Baking it didn't help?

202
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,238
Take it back to where you got it.

203
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:43,339
l tried. They won't take her back.

204
00:12:43,574 --> 00:12:47,010
Maybe that's because she's
a minion of the Antichrist.

205
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,013
Why won't they take it?

206
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:53,740
They said they would only
give me store credit.

207
00:12:54,018 --> 00:12:57,317
What am l gonna do?
Get 1 000 regular cats?

208
00:12:57,755 --> 00:13:01,452
You said it was a show cat. Why don't you
show it, win some prize money.

209
00:13:01,592 --> 00:13:05,358
Those shows cost a hundred bucks to enter,
and all you win are these ribbons...

210
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:08,488
...which technically belong to the damn cat.

211
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:11,067
You can keep it until you
find out what to do with it.

212
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:13,669
That's not the point.
l'm out $ 1 000...

213
00:13:13,938 --> 00:13:15,371
...l'm all scratched up...

214
00:13:15,573 --> 00:13:18,940
...and l'm stuck with this stupid cat
that looks like a hand!

215
00:13:23,581 --> 00:13:24,570
Oh, my God!

216
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:27,446
The cat's made my eyes water.
Don't throw it to me!

217
00:13:27,685 --> 00:13:30,347
My vision's been compromised!

218
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:33,523
Oh, God! Okay.

219
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:36,787
lt's okay. Man, that was close.

220
00:13:37,095 --> 00:13:39,757
Yeah, you almost overreacted
to something.

221
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:46,762
-We have great news.
-We're moving in together. Yay!

222
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:49,704
Congratulations.

223
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:51,397
-l'm so excited!
-So am l.

224
00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:55,340
You're not more excited than l am.
No way. l'm the most excited.

225
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,445
See you at the station later.

226
00:13:57,715 --> 00:14:00,616
l'll see you later.
Don't forget about the moving-in!

227
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,849
So you're moving in with him?

228
00:14:04,055 --> 00:14:08,014
l couldn't tell him no. He got so sad.
Maybe it'll be all right.

229
00:14:08,526 --> 00:14:09,754
l do like him a lot...

230
00:14:09,961 --> 00:14:12,691
...and probably do it
eventually, anyway.

231
00:14:12,964 --> 00:14:15,933
Plus, think of all the money
l'll save on stamps.

232
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:18,399
Do you write him a lot?

233
00:14:18,703 --> 00:14:20,637
l heard when people live together...

234
00:14:20,872 --> 00:14:23,306
...they split the cost
of stamps, don't they?

235
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,041
-Yeah, yeah.
-That's right.

236
00:14:32,116 --> 00:14:34,448
Sorry, the oven mitts
really freaked me out.

237
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:43,549
Hey, honey.

238
00:14:44,662 --> 00:14:46,789
Did you find any apartments
in Brooklyn Heights?

239
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:48,158
No, nothing.

240
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:49,658
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

241
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:51,162
-Nothing at all?
-No.

242
00:14:51,402 --> 00:14:55,463
lf something opens up, we'll move in.
lf it has a pool. l need a pool.

243
00:14:57,809 --> 00:14:59,401
Can l talk to you?

244
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:04,805
Take a seat.

245
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,740
You okay?

246
00:15:07,952 --> 00:15:09,647
You feel all right?

247
00:15:10,354 --> 00:15:12,788
l feel great, because
we're moving in together.

248
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:15,085
So you....

249
00:15:15,326 --> 00:15:19,023
You checked the paper for listings
in Brooklyn Heights, right?

250
00:15:20,498 --> 00:15:21,760
You checked the <i>Post</i>?

251
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,497
Yeah, there was nothing.

252
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,804
-Can l get some water?
-ln a minute.

253
00:15:30,608 --> 00:15:31,939
You checked today's <i>Post</i>?

254
00:15:32,643 --> 00:15:34,201
Yeah, today's.

255
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,611
Because this is today's <i>Post.</i>

256
00:15:37,882 --> 00:15:40,282
And these are the listings l found.

257
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:44,279
Brooklyn Heights, two bedrooms.
Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom.

258
00:15:44,489 --> 00:15:47,652
Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights,
Brooklyn Heights!

259
00:15:48,226 --> 00:15:52,686
Oh, are these for rent?
l thought people were just bragging.

260
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:55,565
Let me tell you what's going on here.

261
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:57,830
Don't look at the table.
Look at me.

262
00:16:00,137 --> 00:16:02,401
Somebody asked someone
to move in with him.

263
00:16:02,673 --> 00:16:05,471
Someone said yes,
but now she has doubts...

264
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,168
...because things are moving too fast.
Does that sound possible?

265
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:14,674
Yes, fine! l am someone!

266
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:18,887
You want me to say it?
l have doubts!

267
00:16:19,156 --> 00:16:20,919
l'm sorry!

268
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:26,425
lt's okay that you feel this way.

269
00:16:26,697 --> 00:16:30,565
lt is soon, and there's things
we don't know about each other.

270
00:16:30,835 --> 00:16:33,269
Everything l know about you,
l really like.

271
00:16:33,504 --> 00:16:37,702
Things l don't know, l'll learn in
a place with our names on the mailbox.

272
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:40,740
That's so sweet.

273
00:16:42,713 --> 00:16:46,012
But if it's too soon for you,
we don't have to do it.

274
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,081
l want you to be happy.

275
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,547
Living with you would make me happy.

276
00:16:50,755 --> 00:16:51,915
You don't have to say that.

277
00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:54,953
l want to live with you.
l want to move in with you.

278
00:16:55,192 --> 00:16:56,591
Are you sure?

279
00:16:57,528 --> 00:17:00,759
Definitely, yes! Let's live in
an apartment we both live in.

280
00:17:01,032 --> 00:17:02,863
Oh, that's great.

281
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:04,692
Oh, wait, one sec.

282
00:17:04,835 --> 00:17:08,202
Hey, you! Behind the glass.
Who are you looking at?

283
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:13,901
l always wanted to say that every time
l was in these rooms, which was never.

284
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:17,937
<i>Show cat!</i>

285
00:17:18,282 --> 00:17:20,375
Quality show cat!

286
00:17:21,886 --> 00:17:23,945
-Show cat!
-Oh, my God!

287
00:17:24,155 --> 00:17:26,248
What's wrong with your baby?

288
00:17:26,924 --> 00:17:28,721
That's not a baby. That's a cat.

289
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:31,660
-lt's creepy-looking.
-Oh, no.

290
00:17:31,896 --> 00:17:35,457
lt's actually very sweet.
lt's very sweet. Look.

291
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:40,802
Yeah. Do you want it?

292
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:42,404
No, l hate cats.

293
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:44,404
Then what are you doing to me?

294
00:17:44,642 --> 00:17:47,668
Get out of here, all right?
Move on!

295
00:17:49,313 --> 00:17:50,803
What an unusual cat.

296
00:17:51,015 --> 00:17:53,609
Yes, thank you! Exactly.
You want it?

297
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:55,275
Maybe.

298
00:17:55,486 --> 00:17:58,649
l was thinking about getting a cat
from the shelter, but....

299
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,421
-Okay. Why not?
-Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.

300
00:18:03,928 --> 00:18:05,520
-What?
-Okay, 1 000.

301
00:18:06,263 --> 00:18:07,958
Didn't you want me to adopt your cat?

302
00:18:08,165 --> 00:18:12,966
l do, but you'll have to look at this
as more of an investment than a cat.

303
00:18:13,237 --> 00:18:15,467
Okay, yeah.
l just wanted a cat.

304
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:23,140
Obviously, you know how to haggle,
so l won't try and take you on.

305
00:18:23,381 --> 00:18:27,545
So $800, and l don't call the cops,
because you are robbing me blind!

306
00:18:27,752 --> 00:18:31,188
Blind! Just take the cat.
Leave the money. Run away!

307
00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:33,584
Run away. Damn it!

308
00:18:34,091 --> 00:18:37,356
Can't you at least smile or something?

309
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:42,761
Did anybody just hear that? Anybody?

310
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,834
-l'm starving.
-Come on, guys. Suck it up!

311
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:54,841
We're closing in on 1 0 hours.

312
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:57,037
lt's gut-check time!

313
00:18:57,248 --> 00:19:01,412
l don't know who made you the boss.
We invented this game.

314
00:19:01,852 --> 00:19:03,615
l made this game what it is!

315
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:05,685
Not fun anymore?

316
00:19:07,358 --> 00:19:08,620
l'm still hungry.

317
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:12,354
There's pizza at my place. We can eat
with one hand. Are you with me?

318
00:19:12,663 --> 00:19:15,257
-l am.
-All right, let's go! Come on!

319
00:19:15,766 --> 00:19:17,358
Let's go, Team Monica!

320
00:19:20,504 --> 00:19:22,563
We can work out the name later.

321
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:28,603
What is your cat doing in my bowl?

322
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:30,437
l'm defrosting a chicken.

323
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:34,776
l sold Mrs. Whiskerson.

324
00:19:35,052 --> 00:19:36,679
Thank God!

325
00:19:37,054 --> 00:19:39,454
-Get your money back?
-Yeah, $ 1 500.

326
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:41,749
You made a profit?

327
00:19:45,062 --> 00:19:47,724
l just came for the red velvet pillow.

328
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:51,130
-There you go.
-Thanks, Rachel.

329
00:19:51,402 --> 00:19:54,371
Don't forget, you can come
visit her anytime.

330
00:19:54,572 --> 00:19:57,200
Oh, good. Great.
l'll keep that in mind.

331
00:20:01,746 --> 00:20:04,271
So is this some kind
of snake or something?

332
00:20:15,826 --> 00:20:17,418
l like waking up with you.

333
00:20:17,628 --> 00:20:20,222
l like waking up with you too.

334
00:20:20,498 --> 00:20:23,331
Oh, it's such a beautiful morning.

335
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:25,000
l could stay here all day.

336
00:20:25,336 --> 00:20:27,065
That would be great.

337
00:20:27,338 --> 00:20:30,967
-We could have breakfast in bed.
-Wait, just a second.

338
00:20:34,078 --> 00:20:35,568
Oh, no.

339
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:42,277
All right. Come on, Monica!
Look alive. Come on!

340
00:20:51,662 --> 00:20:54,028
Oh, l was having the best dream.

341
00:20:54,165 --> 00:20:56,190
-What?
-l dreamed l was drowning...

342
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,858
...and not throwing this ball.

343
00:21:01,305 --> 00:21:02,795
Oh, good. You're all up.

00:21:03,207 --> 00:21:06,472

Oh, yeah. That's over.

Gary's such a great guy.
You can work it out.

347
00:21:11,816 --> 00:21:13,807

lt's okay. lt's okay.

354
00:21:33,437 --> 00:21:36,497
lt didn't happen.
No one needs to know.

355
00:21:36,707 --> 00:21:38,902
She's not an official ball player.

356
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:41,839
Only official ball players
can drop the ball.

00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,635
My arm is killing me.

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,468
No, l meant with
the dropper over here.

reputation as a dropper?

368
00:22:15,212 --> 00:22:17,442
