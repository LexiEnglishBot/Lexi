1
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:13,929
'Cause every time I see your face

2
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:18,100
I can't help but fall from grace

3
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,852
Wow. This girl's good.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,856
Oh, yeah, a song with rhyming words.
Ooh, I never thought of that before.

5
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,234
I like her.

6
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,278
Why? Because she can sing
and play guitar...

7
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,655
...and do both at the same time?

8
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,492
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for
from these people.

9
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,412
Look at you, all jealous.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,665
Yeah, Pheebs, come on.
You two have completely different styles.

11
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:47,880
You know, she's more... you know?
And you're more:

12
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,801
Say you'll stay beside me

13
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:01,018
Okay. See? See?
Everybody else is happy she's done.

14
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,647
Okay, my next song's called:

15
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,692
"Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say?
I Really Loved When We Were...

16
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,321
...Singing Partners and I Shouldn't
Have Left You That Way."

17
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:18,327
Oh, no. One of those
look-for-the-hidden-meaning songs.

18
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,754
Hey, Phoebe.

19
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,005
Hey, Leslie.

20
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,715
How'd you know I'd be here?

21
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,552
I ran into Vlad at the place
where they sell the big fish...

22
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,720
...and he said you played here a lot, so...

23
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,806
All right. I have to go to the bathroom.

24
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,058
But if the place with the big fish
comes up again...

25
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:27,104
...I'd like to know whether that's several
big fish or just one big fish.

26
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,440
So Phoebe tells us you write jingles.

27
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:33,360
Actually, I said she abandoned me
to write jingles.

28
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,072
Uh, anything we might've heard of?

29
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,283
Uh, yeah, um...

30
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,660
Home is never far away

31
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,497
Home is Homestar Stew

32
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,294
Yeah, but I don't do that anymore.
I got kind of sick of it.

33
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:54,923
And then I couldn't come up with
anything good, so they fired me.

34
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,633
Hmm, bummer.

35
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,970
Well, you know, I was just...

36
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:04,641
Um, I was just thinking
and just hoping that...

37
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,311
...maybe you'd want
to get back together?

38
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,313
No, but thanks.

39
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,899
Oh, come on, Phoebe.
Would you just think about it?

40
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,610
Okay.

41
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,111
No, but thanks.

42
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,075
Okay, uh...

43
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,994
See you, Pheebs.

44
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,124
Wow. That was kind of brutal.

45
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,877
Well, okay.
Let this be a lesson to all of you.

46
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,631
All right? Once you betray me,
I become like the Ice Woman.

47
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:40,969
You know, I'm just very cold,
hard, unyielding.

48
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:44,556
You know, nothing, nothing
can penetrate this icy exterior.

49
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,016
Can I have a tissue, please?

50
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,309
Oh, yes.

51
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,733
Is someone in there?

52
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,653
No. This is just part
of a daredevil game...

53
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,657
...that I play called "Wait Until
the Last Moment Before I Burst and Die."

54
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:05,160
Jeez, man. Did you fall...? Hi.

55
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,872
So, uh, did you? Did you fall high?

56
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,251
Someone was in the ladies' room.
I couldn't wait.

57
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,170
- I left the lid up for you, though.
- Ha, ha.

58
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,091
You know what, uh, Gunther?
Go, uh... Go ahead.

59
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,426
I'm talking to, uh...

60
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,846
This is the part
where you say your name.

61
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:28,475
- Ginger.
- Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so...

62
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,357
- Don't you have to use the bathroom?
- No.

63
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,360
No, I just, uh...
I'd rather, uh, talk to you.

64
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,988
Yes, I do.

65
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,074
Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.

66
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,535
Someone in here.

67
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,163
- Where's Chandler?
- He can't make it.

68
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,250
He said he had to go back
to his, uh, job to do, uh...

69
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,876
Uh-oh.

70
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,087
Joey?

71
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,215
Joey Tribbiani?

72
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,140
Joey, I can see you, okay?

73
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,726
You're hiding behind the coats.

74
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,447
Close one. Heh.

75
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,829
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie.

76
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,956
Hello.

77
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,374
Hey, Ross.

78
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,959
Uh-huh.

79
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,463
- I've got some bad news.
- What?

80
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,965
I can get a quick bite,
but I have to come back here.

81
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,427
Come on, sweetie. You've worked late
every night for the past two weeks.

82
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,305
- What is it this time?
- It's kind of my fault. I quit today.

83
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,390
But work comes first.

84
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:54,061
Oh, hey. But that's sad about you, though.
What happened?

85
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,689
What happened? Burn out?
Burn all out, did you?

86
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,735
No, he's leaving for a better job.

87
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,072
Oh, well, that's great.
So I guess this is, uh, goodbye then.

88
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,740
Goodbye. Ha, ha.

89
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,702
- Okay, then.
- Okay.

90
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,996
Well, we're gonna
miss you around here.

91
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,207
Yeah, me too.

92
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,629
- So see you on Saturday.
- Yeah, you bet.

93
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,846
Ugh.

94
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,359
Now, you know those
are a delicacy in India.

95
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,531
Yeah, that was Leslie calling again
to see if we can get back together.

96
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:51,785
It's like the 20th time today.
Yeah, good luck, Leslie.

97
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,621
Wow. She must've hurt you
pretty bad, huh?

98
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,874
Well, yeah.
You know, we were best friends...

99
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:01,711
...ever since we were little.
Our moms worked on the barge together.

100
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,507
You two must've been so cute
running around on a barge.

101
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,843
You never run on a barge.

102
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,097
- Hey.
- Hey.

103
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,682
Is, uh...? Is Chandler around?

104
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,560
No, um, he met some girl
at the coffeehouse.

105
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,311
- Ooh.
- Yeah. Ginger something.

106
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,021
No.

107
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,901
No, no. Uh, are you sure it wasn't
something that sounded liked Ginger?

108
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,653
Like, uh, "Gingeer"?

109
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,698
No, it was Ginger.

110
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,033
I remember because
when he told me, I said:

111
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,411
The movie star

112
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,455
Oh, man.

113
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,707
That's the girl I was hiding from.

114
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,543
When she finds out he's my roommate,
she'll tell him what I did.

115
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:45,755
- What did you do?
- Oh. Oh, no, no. I can't...

116
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,092
I can't tell you that.
It's like the most awful, horrible thing...

117
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,220
...I've ever done in my whole life.
- You know what? Don't tell us.

118
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,015
We'll wait till Chandler gets home
because it'll be more fun.

119
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,516
All right.

120
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,562
Okay, it was, like, four years ago.

121
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,773
Okay, Ginger and I had gone out
a few times. Then one weekend...

122
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,442
...we went to her dad's cabin...

123
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,696
...just me, her and her
annoying little dog, Pepper. Heh.

124
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,824
Well, that night I cooked
this really romantic dinner...

125
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,243
You gave her food poisoning.

126
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,870
I wish. No.

127
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,625
After dinner, me, her and Pepper
all fell asleep in front of the fire.

128
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,587
Well, I woke up in the middle of the night
and I saw that the fire was dying out...

129
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,090
...so I picked up a log and threw it on.

130
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,928
Or at least what I thought was a log.

131
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,722
Oh, my God.
You threw Pepper on the fire.

132
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,308
I wish.

133
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,605
See, I guess another thing I probably
should've told you about Ginger...

134
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,650
...is that she kind of has a, uh...

135
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,068
...artificial leg.

136
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,825
Oh, my God.

137
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,829
Joey. What did you do after
you threw her leg on the fire?

138
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,624
I ran.

139
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,261
Well, that's the best kiss I've had...

140
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,137
...with anybody I met in a men's room.

141
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,974
Actually, me too.

142
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,644
Oh. Foot in a puddle.
Foot all in the puddle.

143
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,146
Oh, damn. I hate that.

144
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,148
We're gonna have to get you
out of those shoes.

145
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,525
Oh, don't worry about it.

146
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,112
- No, really. You're gonna freeze.
- No, I'm not.

147
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,367
Huh. You're not?
What do you got, a bionic foot?

148
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,579
Someday. Maybe.

149
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,674
Funny book?

150
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:58,138
Hmm? Oh, no, no. I'm just thinking about
something funny I heard today.

151
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:02,225
Um, Mark saying, "I'll see you Saturday."

152
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,729
Yeah, at the lecture.

153
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,315
I told you that last week.
You said you didn't mind.

154
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:12,777
Oh, no, no, no.
It's not the lecture, uh, I mind. Um...

155
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,281
Oh, please tell me it's not because
I'm going with Mark.

156
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,618
- Well...
- Oh, my God. Ross.

157
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,996
Well, I'm sorry, but... Look,
if you're not working with him anymore...

158
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,123
...why do you still have to do stuff
with him?

159
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,083
Because he's my friend.

160
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:31,463
Okay. But do you really need
another friend? I mean...

161
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:37,010
Okay. Well, if I stop playing with Joey
and Chandler, can I play with Mark?

162
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,221
Is that funny?
Am I suppose to be laughing?

163
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:44,059
I don't know. You thought
"See you Saturday" was funny.

164
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,561
Look, honey, Mark is in fashion, okay?

165
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,397
I like having a friend
that I can share this stuff with.

166
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,483
You guys would never
go to a lecture with me.

167
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,571
I would love to go with you.

168
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,864
- Really?
- Yeah.

169
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,660
Hey, I have clothes. I even pick them out.

170
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,121
I mean, for all you know,
I could be a fashion...

171
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,956
...monger.

172
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:15,256
Okay. Honey, I would love for you
to go with me.

173
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,925
What?

174
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,969
What should I wear?
Now I'm all nervous.

175
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,149
You know, they say,
"A watched pot never beeps."

176
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,446
It's, you know, ahem...
It's been a couple hours...

177
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,782
...and she hasn't called.

178
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,535
Not that I even care. I don't.

179
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,538
Phoebe, why don't you just call her?

180
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,790
You obviously want to.

181
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,959
You think you know me so well.

182
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,962
- Well, don't you wanna?
- Yeah.

183
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,842
- Okay, so I do know you.
- That's what I said.

184
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,596
- Well, so?
- I can't.

185
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,057
I can't. She dumped me.

186
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,768
I mean, I totally trusted her,
and then one day it was like:

187
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,020
"Okay, bye, Pheebs." Gone.

188
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:16,359
You know what the saddest part is?
When we were playing together...

189
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:20,864
...that was like the most fun
I've ever had in, like, all my lives.

190
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:27,871
My favorite shoes
So good to me, I wear them every day

191
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:33,001
Down at the heel, holes in the toes
Don't care what people say

192
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,004
My feet's best friend
Pals to the end

193
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,840
With them, I'm one hot chickie

194
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,552
Though late one night
Not much light

195
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,306
I stepped in something icky

196
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,936
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes

197
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,647
Always make me smile

198
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:59,861
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes
Next time I'll

199
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,823
Avoid the

200
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,700
Pile

201
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:18,713
We're beginning to see a lot
of layering of sheer fabrics and colors.

202
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,217
For instance, a sheer navy blouse
over a pink...

203
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,969
I'm really glad we came.

204
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,767
You're so pretty.

205
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,897
I love you.

206
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,195
Smelly cat, smelly cat

207
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,406
What are they feeding you?

208
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,535
Smelly cat, smelly cat

209
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:52,914
It's not your fault

210
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:54,999
Wow, that's great.

211
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,169
- Oh, yeah?
- You know, you could totally sell this.

212
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,257
It'd be perfect for, like, um,
a kitty-litter campaign.

213
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,343
A jingle? No, no, no.

214
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,178
Why not? You make a ton of money.

215
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,849
Okay, if I was in this for the money,
I'd be a millionaire by now, you know?

216
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,978
You gotta get out
of that jingle-head, sweetie.

217
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,773
Ugh. You're right. You're right. I'm sorry.

218
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,066
- That's okay.
- Okay.

219
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,194
All right, I'm gonna play a song now
that's really, really sad.

220
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,406
- Okay.
- Okay, it's called "Magician Box Mix-Up."

221
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,622
Oversized bracelets,
oversized earrings...

222
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,626
...oversizing of accessories in general
is very popular now.

223
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,514
- Hi.
- Hey.

224
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,558
Oh, can I borrow this?
My milk's gone bad.

225
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,059
Oh, I hate that.

226
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,313
I once had a thing of half-and-half.
Stole my car.

227
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,234
So how was your date with Ginger?

228
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,739
Great. Ahem. It was great. She's, uh...

229
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,867
She's great. Great looking,
great personality. She's greatness.

230
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,038
Sounds like she's got the, uh...

231
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,332
...whole package.

232
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,377
- Joey told you about the leg, huh?
- Uh-huh.

233
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:26,174
Oh, God. It freaked me out.
Okay? I know it shouldn't have, but it did.

234
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,177
I like her. I don't wanna stop seeing her,
but every so often, it's like:

235
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,846
"Hey, you know what?
Where's your leg?"

236
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,019
I mean, I'm the smallest person
in the world, aren't I?

237
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,188
I'm the smallest person in the world.

238
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,689
Morning.

239
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,692
Actually, he's the smallest person
in the world.

240
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,867
Heard about the leg-burning, huh?

241
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,996
It came up.

242
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:00,833
Ahem, listen, I, uh...
I know it's a long shot, but...

243
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,420
...by any chance,
did she find that funny?

244
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,802
So I nodded off a little.

245
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,055
"Nodded off"? Ross, you were snoring.

246
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:18,434
My father's boat didn't make
that much noise when it hit rocks.

247
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,145
Come on. Forty-five minutes.

248
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:25,483
Forty-five minutes, the man talked
about strappy-backed dresses.

249
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,406
Well, okay, how about four hours
in a freezing museum auditorium...

250
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,908
...listening to Professor Pitstains
and his:

251
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,662
"Hey, everybody. Remember that thing
that's been dead for a gazillion years?

252
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,873
Well, here's a little bone
we didn't know it had."

253
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:48,631
First of all, it's Professor Pitain.

254
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,426
And second of all,
that little bone proved that...

255
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,971
...that particular dinosaur had wings
but didn't fly.

256
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,265
Okay, you know what I just heard?

257
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,394
Blah, blah, blah.

258
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:06,607
You know what? A hundred million people
went to see a movie about what I do.

259
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:11,112
I wonder how many people would go see
a movie called Jurassic Parka.

260
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,281
Oh, that is so...

261
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,742
No, no, no.
A bunch of out-of-control jackets...

262
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,243
...take over an island.

263
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,295
You know, if what I do is so lame...

264
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,715
...then why did you insist on coming
with me this morning?

265
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,051
Huh? Was it so
I just wouldn't go with Mark?

266
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,385
No.

267
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:38,389
I... I wanted to be with you.

268
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,517
I don't know. I feel like lately...

269
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,436
I feel like you're slipping away from me...

270
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,230
...with this new job
and all these new people.

271
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,067
And you've got this
whole other life going on.

272
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,402
I know it's dumb...

273
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,573
...but I just hate that I'm not a part of it.

274
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,871
It's not dumb.

275
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,417
But maybe it's okay
that you're not a part of it.

276
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,752
You know what I mean?

277
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:15,343
I mean, it's like I like that you're not
involved in that part of my life.

278
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,970
That's a little clearer.

279
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,641
Honey, see, it doesn't mean
that I don't love you...

280
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,769
...because I do. I love you.
I love you so much.

281
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,647
But my work, it's for me, you know?

282
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,066
I'm out there on my own,
and I'm doing it.

283
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:34,362
And it's scary,
but I love it because it's mine.

284
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,573
But I mean, is that okay?

285
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,867
Sure. Ha, ha.

286
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,129
You're thinking about my leg,
aren't you?

287
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,131
No, no.

288
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,050
Actually, I forgot.
What is the deal with that again?

289
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:59,137
Look, it's okay if it bothers you.

290
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,140
I mean, the only thing I need to know
is how much it bothers you...

291
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,642
...because I don't like wasting my time.

292
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,936
Am I wasting my time?

293
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:11,274
- No. No, I don't think so.
- Okay.

294
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,819
It's just like anything else.
You just have to get used to it.

295
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,332
What's that?

296
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,711
That's my nubbin.

297
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,758
What's a nubbin?

298
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:43,097
It's kind of a, uh...
A third-nipple kind of thing.

299
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,184
Do you have three nipples?

300
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,936
Well, you know, two regulars, ahem...

301
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:52,440
...and, uh, one that barely qualifies.

302
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,112
- Uh, what?
- Nothing. I...

303
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,448
I just remembered. I have to leave.

304
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:04,035
You, uh...? You have to leave?
Now? How come?

305
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,995
Well, it's nubbin. Nothing.

306
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:11,375
Um, you know what?
I'll see you later. Okay.

307
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,127
Uh...

308
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,963
Ew.

309
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,636
Oh. I thought you weren't coming.

310
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,305
- Where were you?
- Come here. Come here.

311
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,058
Okay. Don't get mad, okay?

312
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,894
Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad,
okay?

313
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:34,565
I played "Smelly Cat" for the people
at my old ad agency. They went nuts.

314
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,361
No, look. I told you that I didn't want you
to try and sell it...

315
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:41,697
...and you just big fat did it anyway.

316
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,660
God. You know what?
I think, five years ago...

317
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,496
...I probably would have done anything
to play with you.

318
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,458
But I can do it by myself, right?
And if I can't trust you, then just forget it.

319
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,460
No. No. I don't wanna forget it.

320
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,337
Okay, you know what?
You have to choose.

321
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:00,007
All right? If the most important thing
on the planet to you...

322
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:05,179
...is this cat-poopy thing,
then, okay, you can have "Smelly Cat."

323
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,390
But we won't be partners.

324
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,392
So what's it gonna be?

325
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:13,145
Smelly cat, smelly cat
ANNOUNCER: Odor in the litter box?

326
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,565
Don't change your kitty.
Change your kitty litter.

327
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:19,485
It's not your fault

328
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,532
- Sorry, Pheebs.
- Yeah.

329
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,200
You okay?

330
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,786
Yeah. I actually am. Yeah.

331
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,665
Because, you know, life's gonna
hand you all kinds of stuff.

332
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,960
You know, you learn your little lessons
and hopefully you grow.

333
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,254
You wanna hear a new song?

334
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,714
- Yeah.
- Oh, we'd love to.

335
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,090
Okay.

336
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,343
Jingle bitch screwed me over

337
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,139
Go to hell, jingle whore

338
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:52,351
Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell

339
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,062
That's all I have so far.

340
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,152
Well, hello.

341
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,196
- Where have you been?
- The doctor.

342
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,698
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, yes.

343
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,451
Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy.

344
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,873
Yep. Two nipples, no waiting.

345
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,709
Well. Just like Rachel in high school.

346
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,837
What?

347
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,799
Come on. Come on, I was kidding.
It was such an obvious joke.

348
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,885
That was an obvious joke.

349
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,054
And I didn't think of it.
Why didn't I think of it?

350
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,599
The source of all my powers.

351
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,603
Oh, dear God, what have I done?
