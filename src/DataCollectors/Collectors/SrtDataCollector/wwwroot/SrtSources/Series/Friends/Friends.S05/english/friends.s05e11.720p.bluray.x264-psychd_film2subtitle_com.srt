1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,086
Is there any entertainment there?

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:08,841
All right. Here we go.
1999, the year of Joey.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,592
We're very happy for you.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,969
What's the matter?

5
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:15,806
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but
nobody else is going to so, you know...

6
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,559
- All right, I'll take care of it.
- Oh, no.

7
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,185
Joey.

8
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,980
- Thirty-three, 32, 31.
- Ross, Ross, Ross.

9
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,816
Listen, who are you kissing at midnight?
Rachel or Phoebe?

10
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,484
- What?
- Well, you gotta kiss someone.

11
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,695
- Can't kiss your sister.
- Who's gonna kiss my sister?

12
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,989
- Chandler.
- Oh, man. Really?

13
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,158
Who would you rather have
kiss your sister?

14
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:35,743
- That's a good point.
- Yeah.

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,371
Uh, well, since I have that whole history
with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.

16
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,043
Okay, great. Pheebs, Pheebs. Listen.
Ross wants to kiss you at midnight.

17
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,254
So obvious. Why doesn't he just ask?

18
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,090
Rach, Rach.
Listen, I'm going to kiss you at midnight.

19
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,885
- What?
- You can't kiss Ross. You got the history.

20
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,261
- So?
- So?

21
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:58,057
- Would you prefer me or Chandler?
- Oh, good point.

22
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,809
Three, two, one.

23
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,228
Happy New Year!

24
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,861
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

25
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,738
- Happy New Year, Pheebs.
- You too.

26
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,156
Happy New Year, Joey.

27
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,492
So that do anything for you?

28
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,708
You know what?

29
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:11,046
I'm going to go out on a limb
and say, "No divorces in '99."

30
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,551
But your divorce isn't even final yet.

31
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,303
Just the one divorce in '99.

32
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,432
You know what?
I'm gonna be happy this year.

33
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,726
I'm gonna make myself happy.

34
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,187
Do you want us to leave the room or?

35
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:32,317
Every day, I am going to do one thing
I have never done before.

36
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,570
That, my friends,
is my New Year's resolution.

37
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,947
- Ooh. That's a good one.
- Yeah?

38
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,075
Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.

39
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,829
That's a good one too. Now you
only have to find a planeload of people...

40
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,999
...whose resolution is
to plummet to their deaths.

41
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,460
Maybe your resolution should be
not to make fun of your friends.

42
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,422
Especially the ones who may soon be
flying you to Europe for free...

43
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,507
...on their own plane.

44
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,844
She has a better chance of sprouting wings
and flying up your nose...

45
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,346
...than you do of not making fun of us.

46
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,767
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks you can't go
the whole year without making fun of us.

47
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,728
You know what? Better yet, a week.

48
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,646
I'll take that bet, my friend.

49
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,065
And you know what?
Paying me the 50 bucks can be...

50
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,484
...the "new thing you do" that day.

51
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,156
And it starts right now.

52
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,785
All right, my New Year's resolution
is to learn how to play guitar.

53
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,412
- Really? How come?
- Ah.

54
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,249
You know those special skills
I have listed on my résumé?

55
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,127
I would love it if one of those was true.

56
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,214
Do you want me to teach you?
I'm a great teacher.

57
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,090
Really? Who have you taught?

58
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,843
Well, I taught me and I loved me.

59
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,055
That'd be great. Yeah, thanks, Pheebs.

60
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,349
Oh, look. Blaire forgot her glasses.

61
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,393
She's gonna be needing these
to keep an eye on that boyfriend.

62
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,772
Who, from what I hear,
needs to keep his stapler...

63
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,484
...in his desk drawer,
if you know what I'm talking about.

64
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,404
Hey, Rach, maybe your resolution
should be to, um, gossip less.

65
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,531
What? I don't gossip.

66
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,536
Maybe sometimes I find out things.

67
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:10,165
Or I hear something
and I pass that information on.

68
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,335
You know, kind of like a public service.

69
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,797
Doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean,
would you call Ted Koppel a gossip?

70
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,967
Well, if Ted Koppel talked about his
coworkers' botched boob jobs...

71
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,343
...yeah, I would.

72
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,388
Well, they were like this.

73
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,396
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

74
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,940
- Hey.
- Hey.

75
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,733
I just asked that girl out.

76
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,610
- Nice.
- Nice. Yeah.

77
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,446
Is that part of your resolution,
your "new thing" for today?

78
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,699
Yes, it is. See?

79
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,867
"Elizabeth...

80
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,995
...Hornswoggle"?

81
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,914
That's right.

82
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,793
Elizabeth Hornswoggle.

83
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,672
Hornswoggle.

84
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,009
You okay, Chandler? Is there something...?

85
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,136
Something funny about that name?

86
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,889
No, no, I just think that maybe
I've heard it somewhere before.

87
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,062
Oh, really? Where?

88
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,857
Somewhere funny I'll bet.

89
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,401
- Hey, Pheebs. Guess what?
- Hey.

90
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:24,031
Uh, I have a date
with, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.

91
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,825
Hornswoggle?

92
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,202
Oh, this must be killing you.

93
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,872
- All right, see you later.
- See you.

94
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,042
All right, Pheebs, I am ready
for my first lesson.

95
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,170
Okay. Oh, no, no,
you don't touch the guitar.

96
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,173
No, no. First you learn here,
then you learn here.

97
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,217
- Oh. Okay.
- Okay.

98
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:48,013
- Okay. Lesson One: Chords.
- Ah.

99
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,975
Now, um, I don't know
the actual names of the chords, um...

100
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:57,397
But I made up names for the way
my hand looks while I'm doing them.

101
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,902
So then, this is "Bear Claw."

102
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,655
Okay, "Turkey Leg"...

103
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,950
...and "Old Lady."

104
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:14,206
What an interesting approach
to guitar instruction.

105
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:20,170
You know, some might find it amusing.
I myself find it regular.

106
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,008
Hey, everybody.

107
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,928
Rachel was so good today.
She didn't gossip at all.

108
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,764
I didn't. Even when I found out, um...

109
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,934
All right, let's just say I found out
something about someone...

110
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,685
...and let's just say...

111
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,729
...she's gonna keep it.

112
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,942
Hey, Pheebs. Check this out.

113
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,199
Ooh. You nailed the Old Lady. Oh!

114
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,034
Oh, ha, ha!

115
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,164
Hey, listen,
I thought I was getting better...

116
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,000
...so on my way home today
I stopped by this guitar store...

117
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,587
Did you touch any of the guitars
while you were there?

118
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,048
Did you?

119
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,802
No.

120
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,013
Give me your hands.

121
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,349
Strings.

122
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,060
Pick.

123
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,606
Do you want to learn to play guitar?

124
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,109
- Yes.
- Then don't touch one!

125
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,321
- Hi.
- Hi.

126
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,198
- Hi, Ben.
- Auntie Monica.

127
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,908
Aw.

128
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,411
Ross is wearing leather pants.

129
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,377
Does nobody else see
that Ross is wearing leather pants?

130
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,505
Someone comment on the pants.

131
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,469
- I think they're very nice.
- I really like them a lot.

132
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,306
Not what I had in mind.

133
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,976
See, people like Ross
don't generally wear these types of pants.

134
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,437
You see, they're very tight.

135
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,565
Maybe there's something in that area?

136
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,776
- I think they look really good.
- I like them.

137
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,654
Yeah, where did you get them?

138
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,781
See, I needed a new thing for today.

139
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,535
And there's this leather store I go by
that always smells so good.

140
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:19,372
And I thought to myself,
"Wow. You know, I've never owned...

141
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,127
...a really good-smelling
pair of pants before."

142
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,465
Oh, come on.

143
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,012
Okay, seriously. What do you think?

144
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,473
- You look like a freak. Yeah, awful.
- Awful.

145
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,895
Hey. What are you doing?
What are you doing?

146
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,440
- It's my New Year's resolution.
- To blind my child?

147
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,401
No, to take more pictures
of all of us together.

148
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,321
I really think it's the best resolution.
Everyone can enjoy them.

149
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,323
Well, everyone will enjoy my music
as well.

150
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,006
My God, these pants. I'm burning up.

151
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:16,221
Oh, God. She wants to snuggle now?
What, is she trying to kill me?

152
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,932
It's like a volcano in here.

153
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:23,436
- Are you hot?
- No.

154
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,523
Okay, it must just be me then.

155
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,372
That was just the pants and the couch.

156
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,085
Um, hey, do you mind
if I use your bathroom?

157
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,754
- Oh, go ahead.
- Thanks.

158
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,085
Ah.

159
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,713
Hey, my favorite part's coming up.

160
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,548
Okay.

161
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,233
Oh, my God!

162
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,239
Tiger. Dragon.

163
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,949
Iceberg.

164
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:03,578
Joseph, did you even study
at all last night?

165
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,498
- Yes. Yes, I did.
- Then do Iceberg.

166
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,752
- G-sharp.
- G-sharp?

167
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,881
Have you been studying
the real names of the chords?

168
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,425
Have you?

169
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,303
Oh, my God.

170
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,555
What? I didn't touch a guitar.

171
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,432
No, but you're questioning my method.

172
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,852
No, I'm not questioning it, Phoebe.
I'm saying it's stupid.

173
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,021
What?

174
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,525
Thank you.

175
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,486
You know, none of my other student...

176
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,155
...thought I was stupid.

177
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,617
Your other student was you!

178
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:47,914
Yeah, well, you know,
maybe you just need to try a little harder.

179
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,833
Maybe I need to try a real teacher.

180
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,877
Right here. Here. Andy Cooper.
He teaches guitar.

181
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,338
And look.
Ooh, there's a picture of him with a kid.

182
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,049
Yeah, and the kid's got a guitar!

183
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:03,972
Fine. You go learn from
your qualified instructor.

184
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,558
But don't come crying to me
when everyone is sick and tired...

185
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,811
...of hearing you play
"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown."

186
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,606
Baddest man in the whole damn town

187
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,234
Oh, fine. Take his side.

188
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,905
Hmm.

189
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,951
I can't wait to be with you.

190
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,287
I'll sneak over as soon as Ross
picks up Ben.

191
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,998
I'll tell Rachel I'm gonna be
doing laundry for a couple hours.

192
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,293
Laundry. Huh.
Is that my new nickname?

193
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,005
Aw.

194
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,841
You know what your nickname is,
Mr. Big...

195
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,732
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Ross. I need some help.

196
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,942
Uh, Chandler's not here.

197
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,652
Well, you can help me.

198
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,822
- Okay.
- Listen.

199
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,949
I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom.

200
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,785
Nice.

201
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:11,164
No, I got really hot in my leather pants
so I took them off.

202
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,459
But they must have shrunk
from the sweat or something.

203
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,921
Or my legs expanded from the heat.

204
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:22,675
I can't get them back on, Joey. I can't.

205
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,054
Oh. That is quite a situation.

206
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,642
Uh, do you see any, like, powder?

207
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,728
Powder. Yeah, yeah, I have powder.

208
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,313
Good, good. Okay.

209
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,899
Sprinkle some on your legs.
It'll absorb moisture.

210
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,734
Then you can get your pants back on.

211
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,945
Yeah, hold on.

212
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,678
They're not coming on, man.

213
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,348
Um, you see any...? Oh, Vaseline?

214
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,020
I see lotion. I have lotion.
Will that work?

215
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,649
- Yeah, sure, throw some of that on there.
- Hold on.

216
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,582
Ross, you okay?

217
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,585
They're still not coming on, man.

218
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:42,130
And the lotion and the powder
have made a paste.

219
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,716
Really?

220
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,510
Uh, what color is it?

221
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,306
What difference does that make?

222
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:55,435
Well, if the paste matches the pants,
you can make yourself paste pants...

223
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,687
...and she won't know the difference.

224
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,231
Joey, do you have a minute?

225
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,858
Dude, what am I...?

226
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,069
Rachel's here, so good luck, man.
Let me know how it works out.

227
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,325
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem.

228
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,160
Oh, well, your timing couldn't be better.

229
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,038
I'm putting out fires all over the place.

230
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:19,918
Okay, okay.
Joey, I have got to tell you something.

231
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,252
What is it? What is it?

232
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,631
Oh, my God. It's so huge. But you have to
promise me, you cannot tell anyone.

233
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:28,134
- No, no, no. I don't want to know.
- What?

234
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,803
Yes, yes, yes. You do want to know.
This is unbelievable.

235
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,724
I don't care, Rach. Look, I'm tired of being
the guy who knows all the secrets...

236
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,059
...and can't tell anyone.

237
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,769
You know secrets? What are they?

238
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,604
And you're not supposed
to be gossiping.

239
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,482
No, I know, I can't keep this in.
So I pick up the phone...

240
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,907
I'm not listening to you.

241
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,757
Ross? Um...

242
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,259
You've been in there for a long time.

243
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,096
I'm starting to get kind of freaked out.

244
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,974
All right, I'm coming out.

245
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,894
Hey, can you turn the lights off?

246
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,733
No. Let's just leave the lights on.

247
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,704
Oh, my God.

248
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,540
I had a problem.

249
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,380
Hey, Pheebs.

250
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:51,843
Oh, I can't talk to you. I don't have
a fancy ad in the yellow pages.

251
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,762
Look...

252
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,931
Pheebs, I just...

253
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:01,728
I want to apologize for saying
your method was stupid.

254
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,566
And maybe, ask you
to be my teacher again?

255
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:10,445
And I promise, I won't touch a guitar
until you say I'm ready.

256
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,956
- You really think I'm ready?
- Uh-huh.

257
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,334
Wow, cool.

258
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,795
Okay.

259
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:48,441
- Was the chord at least right before...?
- No.

260
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,326
Oh, my God.

261
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,538
We heard about your pants. I'm so sorry.

262
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,458
This year was supposed to be great.

263
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,544
Well, it's only the second day,
and I'm a loser...

264
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,465
...with stupid leather pants
that don't even fit.

265
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,302
You're not a loser.

266
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,429
Look at me.

267
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,313
Hey, look. Look, Ross.

268
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,440
Ben drew a picture of you.

269
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,984
Huh? You're a cowboy.

270
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,155
Oh.

271
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,616
Because of the leather pants?

272
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,287
Ben doesn't think you're a loser.
He thinks you're a cowboy.

273
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,705
I mean, that's something.

274
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,917
- It really is something.
- Howdy, partner. Hey.

275
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,712
Maybe I should get another pair.

276
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,215
Ooh, you know, they had some...

277
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:58,261
...with fringe all down the sides.

278
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,723
I'm gonna go kiss Ben good night.

279
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,188
I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.

280
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,567
I would make a good cowboy.

281
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,659
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up
here, I'm gonna go do my laundry.

282
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,787
Yeah, me too.
You know, if this shirt is dirty. Yep.

283
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,212
Okay, I'm gonna go to.

284
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,132
I'm gonna go to the airport.
If I hang around there long enough...

285
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,343
...someone's bound to leave
one of those planes unattended.

286
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,138
- Good luck, honey.
- Bye.

287
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,937
Hey, uh, Joey, remember that big thing
I was going to tell you about?

288
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:57,236
I'm not gonna tell you.
But if you found out on your own...

289
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,364
...that would be okay,
and then we could talk about it, right?

290
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:04,285
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret.
So, yeah, that would be okay. Yeah, yeah.

291
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,495
Yeah.

292
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,917
Hey, Joe, would you mind going over
into Chandler's bedroom...

293
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,253
...and getting that book back
that he borrowed from me?

294
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,800
Now? You want me
to go over there now?

295
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,344
Yeah.

296
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,680
- Do you know something?
- Do you know something?

297
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,476
- I might know something.
- I might too something too.

298
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,604
- What's the thing you know?
- You tell me what you know.

299
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,231
- I can't tell you.
- Then I can't.

300
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,024
Okay, fine.

301
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,284
You don't know.

302
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:49,163
How about I go there and walk into
Chandler's bedroom and see the thing...

303
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,208
...that I think I know is actually
the thing I think I know.

304
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,877
- You know.
- And you know.

305
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,128
Yeah, I know.

306
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,215
Chandler and Monica?
Oh, this is unbelievable.

307
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,968
- How long have you known?
- Too long. Oh, my God.

308
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:05,054
Rach, I've been dying to talk
to someone about this for so long.

309
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:09,225
Listen, listen. You can't say anything
to anybody. They're so weird about that.

310
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,895
- Listen. Hey, Phoebe.
- Hey.

311
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:16,691
It's raining. I don't like to fly
in the rain so...

312
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,905
Oh, I am going to go for a walk
in the rain. Ha, ha.

313
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,240
Oh, yeah, me too.

314
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,413
That's weird.

315
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,790
I bet they're doing it.

316
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,758
Oh, good. Okay, look. I can't
take it anymore. I can't take it anymore.

317
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,011
So you win. Okay? Here.

318
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,180
Pheebs? Flying a jet?
Better make it a spaceship...

319
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,641
...so you can get back
to your home planet.

320
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,855
And Ross. Phone call for you today.
Tom Jones. He wants his pants back.

321
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:01,027
And Hornswoggle? What, are you dating
a character from Fraggle Rock?
