1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,037
Good morning, tiger.

2
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:09,572
l'm making you a big breakfast, so you
can keep up your strength for tonight.

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:12,211
You're gonna get me
good and pregnant.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,449
l've got nowhere to go this morning.
l'm unemployed.

5
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,550
l don't know what
l'm gonna do with my life.

6
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:21,810
Well, l just lost my erection.

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,713
No, l mean, what am l supposed
to do with myself?

8
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,222
You're supposed to find
your passion in life.

9
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:30,158
You can be whatever you want
to be now. lt's exciting.

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,458
Yeah, but it's all so overwhelming.
l don't know where to start.

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,601
Wait a second.
l can help you with this.

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,070
You just need to be organized. We can
make a list of your qualifications...

13
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:47,009
...and categorize jobs by industry.
There could be folders and files--

14
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:51,707
Hey, this is where your hyper-organized
pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off.

15
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,977
l know!

16
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,514
My erection is back!

17
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,399
Thank you.

18
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,702
Joey, could l have a sip of your coffee
and a bite of your muffin?

19
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,777
-Okay.
-Thank you.

20
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,247
Thank you.

21
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,849
Pheebs, have you ever been bitten
by a hungry ltalian?

22
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:10,928
l'm sorry.
lt's just, l'm a little short on cash.

23
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,258
lf you want,
l could loan you some money.

24
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,492
Oh, no. l learned never to
borrow money from friends.

25
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:20,935
That's why Richard Dreyfuss
and l don't speak anymore.

26
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,434
Why don't you
just spunge off your boyfriend?

27
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,603
Yeah, right, the unemployed piano player
who gave his trust fund to charity?

28
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,839
l'm splitting the muffin with him.

29
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:34,709
Hey, how about this?
Wanna be an extra on my show?

30
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,286
You could do that?

31
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,857
The pay's pretty good, and you
could do it for as long as you need.

32
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:43,462
-Oh, my God. l'm gonna be on TV!
-Okay, now....

33
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,430
l gotta tell you, being on TV isn't
as glamorous and exciting as you think.

34
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,366
-Really?
-No, it is awesome.

35
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,270
Hey, guys.

36
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,400
Why are you all dressed up?

37
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:01,946
We're bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren
today to introduce her to everyone.

38
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,310
-Doesn't she look cute?
-She sure does.

39
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,044
Why does she have a pink bow
taped to her head?

40
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,984
Because if one more person says,
''What a cute little boy'' ...

41
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,954
...l'm gonna whip them
with a car antenna.

42
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,753
l think she's gonna be
the hit of the office.

43
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:20,229
Yeah, she's gonna be hotter
than peasant blouses and A-line skirts.

44
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,796
Can l get a blue bow?

45
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,770
Okay. l have looked through
a bunch of career guides...

46
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,411
...photocopied and highlighted
key passages...

47
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:37,744
...and put them into alphabetical folders,
so you can make an informed decision.

48
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,078
How long was l in there?

49
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,889
Okay, let's start with the A's.
Advertising.

50
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:47,949
Wait. Advertising, that's a great idea.

51
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,622
Don't you wanna look through the rest?

52
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:56,496
l don't think l have to hear the rest.
Advertising makes perfect sense.

53
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,660
Sorry you had to waste all this time.

54
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:03,036
You call eight hours alone
with my label maker wasted time?

55
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,268
Now l'll get to use my shredder!

56
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:09,938
l mean, l could write slogans.
How hard could it be, right?

57
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:15,119
''Cheese. lt's milk that you chew.''

58
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:23,061
''Crackers. Because your cheese
needs a buddy.''

59
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:28,030
''A grape. Because who can get
a watermelon in your mouth?''

60
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,192
l got one.

61
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,397
''Socks. Because your family's feet
deserve the best.''

62
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,132
Honey, leave it to the pros.

63
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,568
l actually know someone in advertising.

64
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,715
l grew up with a guy who is
a vice president at a big agency.

65
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,640
Maybe l can get him to meet you.
Give me the phone.

66
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:50,949
''The phone. Bringing you closer
to people who have phones.''

67
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,726
''Marriage. lt's not for everybody.''

68
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:02,593
That went well. Almost everybody
knew that she was a girl.

69
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:06,327
Yeah, after you punched that one guy
who got it wrong, word spread.

70
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,334
l'm just gonna go in my office
and pick up some stuff.

71
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,438
-Who the hell are you?
-Who the hell are you?

72
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:20,017
l'm the hell person
whose office this is.

73
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,381
Good one, Rach.

74
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,485
l'm Gavin Mitchell,
the person who's taking over your job.

75
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,484
Excuse me?

76
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,497
Your baby's so cute.

77
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,700
But why would you put
a pink bow on a boy?

78
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,969
Hey, Joey. Look at me.

79
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,631
l'm a nurse.

80
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,936
Yes, you are.

81
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:48,136
l think it might be time
for my sponge bath.

82
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:51,477
Sorry, l'm just so used
to hitting on the extras.

83
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:55,143
-So are you excited about your scene?
-Yeah, but l'm a little nervous.

84
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:59,052
Relax. Don't be. They'll probably
just make you stand in the background.

85
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:02,455
-Good.
-You. Here, come here. Here.

86
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:06,086
Take this tray, stand on this yellow mark.
You're gonna move on ''action.''

87
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:10,065
Walk over to the operating table, stop on
the blue mark and put the tray down.

88
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,828
Don't walk too fast.

89
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:15,032
But don't dawdle.

90
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,333
Okay. Now, what?

91
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:21,644
And, action!

92
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,244
Cut! Cut.

93
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,913
-l'm sorry. l'm just a little nervous.
-Well, don't be.

94
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,924
Okay, that helps.

95
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,322
And, action!

96
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,493
Cut!

97
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:47,503
Don't worry about it, Pheebs.
lt usually takes me three takes too.

98
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:48,935
All right, eight.

99
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:55,781
And, action!

100
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,757
So do you have any other
questions about advertising?

101
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,666
No. But let me show you what l can do.

102
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,706
''Bagels and doughnuts.

103
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,868
Round food for every mood.''

104
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,605
Monica warned me you might do that.

105
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,351
l think we might have something
for you at the agency.

106
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:39,548
-Really? That's great.
-lt's an unpaid internship.

107
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:45,191
That's funny. When you said ''unpaid,''
it sounded like you said ''unpaid.''

108
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:49,664
lt won't be forever. lt just takes a year
or two to get good portfolio together.

109
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:55,832
Well, l can skip a couple of steps, right?
l mean, you did hear my round food thing.

110
00:07:56,008 --> 00:08:00,001
You're changing careers. No matter what
you do, you'll have to start at the bottom.

111
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:04,275
lt's gonna be years before you're making
anything near as much as you were before.

112
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,214
So you're paying the check, right?

113
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:11,584
Come on, now. Monica has a good job.
lt's not like you have a family to support.

114
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:15,523
Actually, we're trying. l don't think
Monica is gonna want to postpone it.

115
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,687
We're supposed to have sex tonight.

116
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:22,595
Actually, she's probably at home,
naked right now.

117
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,433
l tend to keep talking
till somebody stops me.

118
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:33,104
-l can just picture her on the bed.
-Stop!

119
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,138
Wait. What do you mean
you're taking over my job?

120
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,683
While you were on your baby vacation,
l was doing your job.

121
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,016
A vacation? My idea
of a vacation does not involve...

122
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,490
...something sucking on my nipples
until they are raw.

123
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:53,022
Clearly, you've never been
to Sandals Paradise lsland.

124
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,668
All right. Don't get too comfortable
there, because l'm back in two weeks.

125
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,500
l want everything back
the way it was.

126
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:05,132
l can't say l care too much for the way
you've rearranged my office.

127
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,212
l can't say l care too much
for that smell you've brought in.

128
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:13,747
-Excuse me?
-Rach, we have a code brown situation.

129
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:17,415
Honey, could you please
take care of it for me?

130
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:22,517
All right, but you're gonna
have to do one sometime.

131
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,426
Let me just get this straight.

132
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,965
So l go have a baby, and they send
some guy in to do my job?

133
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:33,231
Well, there was talk of shutting down
Ralph Lauren altogether.

134
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,601
Okay. Right.
You're very cheeky for a temp.

135
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:39,302
l'm not a temp. l was transferred here
from another department.

136
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,345
And what department was that?
The jerk department?

137
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,379
They didn't tell me
about your quick wit.

138
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,077
Well, did they mention that
l'm rubber and you're glue?

139
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:52,747
-Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.
-Hi, Mr. Zelner.

140
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,790
Rachel. l see you've met Gavin.

141
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:58,020
When you left us, we weren't sure
what we were gonna do.

142
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:02,065
But then, Gavin to the rescue.
Super Gavin.

143
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,792
Well, that's great.

144
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,064
So now, Super Gavin,
when l come back...

145
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,403
...where do you plan on flying off to?

146
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,411
That's up to Mr. Zelner.
l'm sure he'll make the right decision.

147
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,648
Super ass-kissing power.

148
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,617
lncidentally, when are you coming back?

149
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,214
Today.

150
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:28,484
-You said two weeks.
-No, l said today.

151
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:32,620
See, for a superhero,
not so much with the listening.

152
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,324
l'm sorry.
Rachel, we should probably go.

153
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,801
l ran out of diapers,
and l had to use your sweater.

154
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,668
-l didn't bring a sweater.
-Then, we should really go.

155
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,643
So, what'd he say?

156
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,553
He can be a little rough
around the edges...

157
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:02,490
...so l'm gonna replace a word
he used a lot with the word ''puppy.''

158
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:09,096
So he said, ''lf your puppy friend
doesn't get her puppy act together...

159
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:12,328
...l am gonna fire
her mother-puppy ass.''

160
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,208
l'm sorry. l can't do this.
l'm just not an actor.

161
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,775
That's right. You're not.
You're a nurse.

162
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,435
-You're Nurse With Tray.
-No, Joey--

163
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:24,741
Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey.
She has no time for friends.

164
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:28,580
She gets in that operating room
and she carries that tray to the doctor...

165
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:30,722
...because if she doesn't, people die.

166
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,687
Who dies?

167
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,621
Man With Eye Patch!

168
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,228
Now, you get in there,
and you do your job.

169
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,454
Yes, doctor.

170
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:43,292
Okay, let's try this one more time.

171
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:47,872
Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch.
Your tray is coming.

172
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,541
And, action.

173
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,780
Yes, l did it! l nailed it!

174
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,247
What's next?

175
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,887
The rest of the scene.

176
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,489
Okay, from the top, people.

177
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:19,601
Hey, you know what l was thinking? l don't
know if ''code brown'' is the best code word.

178
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:23,264
l think people might know
what we're talking about.

179
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:27,811
That's fine. Listen, sudden change of plans.
My maternity leave just ended.

180
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,040
They said if l didn't
come back today, they'd fire me.

181
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,048
What? No, that's illegal.

182
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,779
l'll have the Labor Department
here so fast, they won't--

183
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:41,621
All right, calm down, Norma Rae.
They didn't actually say that.

184
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:46,197
l'm just afraid if l don't come back now,
this guy will try and squeeze me out.

185
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:49,425
But what about Emma?
l mean, we don't have a nanny.

186
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:52,661
l know. We're just gonna have
to figure out a plan tonight.

187
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,238
Can you please just take care
of her for today?

188
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:59,235
Absolutely. Just give me your breasts,
and we'll be on our way.

189
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:04,145
Come on.
l don't know what else to do.

190
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,978
Fine. Fine.

191
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,850
We'll have fun, won't we?
Yes, we will. Yes, we--

192
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,528
Ross.

193
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,256
You're pretty.

194
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:31,270
Whatever l decide to do, l'm gonna be
starting a new career from scratch.

195
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,408
lt's gonna be a while
before l make a living at it.

196
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,078
Maybe now's not the right time
to be starting a family.

197
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:43,881
So you have to tell Monica you don't
want to have a baby right now?

198
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,080
Yeah.

199
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,754
Goodbye.

200
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:55,889
Okay, it's baby time.
Pants off, Bing.

201
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,732
Didn't see you there, Geller.

202
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,708
Ross is here, so....

203
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:10,006
And l was really hoping
that maybe l could hang out.

204
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,250
You know, what do you feel like doing?

205
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,755
Well, we're gonna have sex.

206
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:21,085
l don't feel like having sex.

207
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,792
Maybe.... l don't know. Maybe we
can watch a movie or something.

208
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,466
Let me put it this way:

209
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,160
We're having sex
whether you're here or not.

210
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,735
Pants off, Bing.

211
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:43,608
Now that l'm back, why don't you just
fill me in on what you've been up to.

212
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:47,785
Well, l've changed your screen saver
from that picture of *NSYNC.

213
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,750
Hey, they were popular when l left.

214
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,550
l'm working on this
big presentation for tomorrow.

215
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,283
l should be involved in that,
so get me up to speed.

216
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,329
That'll take weeks.
Let me take care of the presentation.

217
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,762
No. l see what you're
doing here, all right?

218
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:06,337
This is my job, buddy. l've had it for
five years, and l know how it works.

219
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:10,632
-So why don't you just catch me up.
-Fine.

220
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:14,210
Oh, God. You've totally messed
with the back support on my chair.

221
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,712
-How do you fix this?
-You've been here five years.

222
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:20,682
-You figure it out.
-Fine, l will.

223
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,649
All right, fill me in.

224
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:39,497
Do you have a blue tie that would go
with this? Emma spit up on mine.

225
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,402
Yeah, but you have to give it back
if l get a job.

226
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,304
Of course, by that time,
ties will be obsolete...

227
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:48,640
...and we'll all be wearing
silver jumpsuits.

228
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,713
Hey, good morning, lover.

229
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:55,513
l gotta say, after last night,
l'm a little weak in the knees.

230
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:03,356
Here's an idea. You walk into a room,
take a quick scan.

231
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,022
Sorry.

232
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:11,999
But l kind of have this feeling that
we may have made a baby last night.

233
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:16,198
Oh, God, l have to tell you something.

234
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,176
You're not pregnant.

235
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:19,875
What are you talking about?

236
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:23,612
Well, that thing that l have to do
to make a baby?

237
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:24,942
l faked it.

238
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,083
What? You faked it?

239
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,352
You know what?

240
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,155
l don't need a tie.

241
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:41,162
l mean, it's better open collar,
you know?

242
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,162
lt's more casual.

243
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:53,438
Joey. Listen, l can't do this.
lt doesn't make any sense.

244
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:57,412
Yesterday l was a nurse,
and today l'm a waitress at a café?

245
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:01,074
Sometimes we use the same extras
for different parts. lt's okay.

246
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:05,950
Well, it's not okay, because l gave a very
memorable performance as the nurse.

247
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:10,585
And now, suddenly, l'm the waitress?
That's gonna confuse my fans.

248
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,599
Well, maybe you are a nurse...

249
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:20,205
...but you moonlight as a waitress.

250
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,111
Because l'm a single mother
supporting my two children.

251
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,114
Nice.

252
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,081
Wait a minute.

253
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:37,779
Dr. Drake Ramoray and l work at the
same hospital. Wouldn't l come say hi?

254
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,086
No. No, see, you and Drake
are having a fight.

255
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:43,851
About what?

256
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:47,362
He slept with you--
Best sex you ever had, by the way.

257
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,594
And then never called you.

258
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,866
And l just wanted a new daddy
for Davey and Becky.

259
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,468
Okay. Okay, from the top.

260
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,972
And, action.

261
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,345
So l'm surprised you agreed
to have lunch with me.

262
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,020
l'm surprised too. But yet, here l am.

263
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,949
Cut! Cut!

264
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,558
What are you doing?

265
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:18,957
l'm very angry at him because he slept
with me and never called me back.

266
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,155
-Me too.
-Me too!

267
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,699
Calm down. She means on the show.

268
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,498
We need some new extras
around here.

269
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,735
Wow. You're here already.

270
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:37,348
Yes. Emma and l came in a little early
to do research on the presentation.

271
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:41,077
Actually, l made a few changes.
l think l'm caught up on everything.

272
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,083
So ask me anything.

273
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,347
-How do you fix the chair?
-Except that!

274
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:51,886
Hello, Mr. Zelner. We are all ready
for our presentation this afternoon.

275
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:56,932
-Good, because it's in 1 0 minutes.
-What? l can't do that. l have the baby.

276
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,263
Ross is not gonna pick her up
for an hour.

277
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,271
Then Gavin can give the presentation.
We have to do it now.

278
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:06,070
Ralph needs to leave early today.
He's going helicopter shopping.

279
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,973
But l love that man.
l'd follow him into hell.

280
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,040
Microphones.

281
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,219
Well, there you go, you win.
You win.

282
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,359
You get to do the presentation.
You'll knock them dead.

283
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:25,293
No one will remember that l worked here,
and then Ralph will buy his helicopter...

284
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:29,024
...and Super Gavin will just fly
right alongside of him.

285
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:37,104
-You can do the presentation.
-No, l can't. l have a baby.

286
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,373
l'll watch her.

287
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:42,741
Why would you do that?

288
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:47,779
Because you worked really hard, and
it's your job. And you're a little crazy.

289
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,649
That's really nice.

290
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,783
l should tell you that crying women
make me very uncomfortable.

291
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,487
Well, you're not gonna like
what's coming.

292
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,557
l'm sorry, l'm sorry.
l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

293
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,602
God.

294
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,969
Thank you. Thank you.

295
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:17,346
l'm really fine. Don't worry.
l'm great with children.

296
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,286
Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you.

297
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:36,031
Please don't fire my friend.
Just let me talk to her.

298
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:39,034
-Okay, but this is her last chance.
-Thank you.

299
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,434
How about l do something for you?

300
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,701
Tomorrow, l'll bring you a hat,
cover up the bald.

301
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,706
Listen, Pheebs. l was just talking
to the director...

302
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,909
...and he was thinking maybe
this time you don't hit Drake.

303
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,520
You just wait on the tables.

304
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,721
l can't do that. l'm an actor.
l have a process.

305
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,326
You're a masseuse.
You have a table with a hole in it.

306
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,421
Wait, l see what's happening here.
You're threatened.

307
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,725
What?

308
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,336
l'm so good in the scene
that l'm stealing focus from you.

309
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:15,768
Rise to the challenge, Tribbiani,
because l just raised the bar.

310
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,169
Come join me up here.

311
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:22,144
-Okay, great. l will.
-Okay, good.

312
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:29,847
Yeah, you can fire her, but l would
call security. She won't go easy.

313
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:35,685
You faked it?
You couldn't have faked it.

314
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:39,887
Yes, you can. You just make
the faces and the noises.

315
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,562
Guys can fake it?

316
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,670
Unbelievable.
The one thing that's ours.

317
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:52,207
Why would you fake it
when we're trying to have a baby?

318
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:55,039
Well, that's actually why.

319
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:58,179
Look, l'm starting
a whole new career now.

320
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,375
l'm not saying l don't want a baby.

321
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:04,010
l'm just saying maybe
we could wait a little while.

322
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:05,588
Like a month?

323
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,756
-Or a year?
-Really? You wanna wait a year?

324
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:13,056
lt could be less than a year.
l mean, you've heard my stuff.

325
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:18,362
''Pants. Like shorts but longer.''

326
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,538
lt'll probably be more than a year.

327
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:31,043
-l really wanna have a baby.
-Well, yeah, me too.

328
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:37,085
Look, l'll just get my old job back.

329
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:39,723
No, l want you to have
a job that you love...

330
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:43,459
...not statistical analysis
and data reconfiguration.

331
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,392
l quit, and you learn what l do?

332
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:53,237
l think there's never gonna be
a right time to have a baby.

333
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,498
Now you're unemployed,
and in a little while...

334
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,768
...you'll find a new job
that'll keep you really busy.

335
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,572
There's always gonna be
a reason not to do this...

336
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:05,979
...but l think once the baby comes,
we'll forget about all those reasons.

337
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,181
l guess.

338
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,323
l mean, it's always gonna be scary
when we have a baby.

339
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,925
lt's gonna be really scary.

340
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:18,028
l mean, God, when we have a baby...

341
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:21,757
...there's gonna be so much
that we're not able to control.

342
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:26,303
l mean, the apartment's
gonna be a mess.

343
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:29,269
l won't have time to clean it.

344
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,604
What if the baby gets
into the ribbon drawer...

345
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,440
...and messes up all the ribbons?

346
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,775
What if there's no room
for a ribbon drawer...

347
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,349
...because the baby's stuff
takes up all the space?

348
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,680
Where will all the ribbons go?

349
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,389
Should we go make a baby
before you change your mind?

350
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,389
-Yes, please!
-Okay.

351
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,461
And l promise l will not
fake it this time.

352
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,929
Well, l wish l could say the same.
l'm a little shook up.

353
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,270
l know you botched
that operation on purpose.

354
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:06,639
l can't prove it yet, but when l do,
you'll be going to jail for murder.

355
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,541
l don't care if you are my brother.

356
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,541
l'm not your brother.

357
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,650
What about my children, Drake?

358
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,953
No! No! No!

359
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,286
God!
