1
00:00:02,414 --> 00:00:03,745
Come on, Joey!

2
00:00:03,982 --> 00:00:06,382
l told you everything l knew
last night.

3
00:00:06,618 --> 00:00:09,314
lt's not that big a deal.
So they're doing it.

4
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:13,117
l cannot believe you would say that!

5
00:00:13,325 --> 00:00:17,056
Sorry. Monica and Chandler
are ''making love.''

6
00:00:18,163 --> 00:00:21,826
No, l mean, come on.
This is a huge deal!

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,001
l need more details.
Who initiated the first kiss?

8
00:00:25,504 --> 00:00:26,493
l don't know.

9
00:00:27,706 --> 00:00:30,504
God, l just can't imagine Chandler
being romantic.

10
00:00:32,778 --> 00:00:34,837
ls he romantic with her?

11
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,169
l don't know.

12
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,612
Are they in love?

13
00:00:40,452 --> 00:00:41,441
l don't know.

14
00:00:43,288 --> 00:00:44,721
You don't know anything.

15
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:46,015
l know one thing.

16
00:00:46,858 --> 00:00:48,086
They did it right there.

17
00:00:50,529 --> 00:00:52,292
The One With Chandler's Work Laugh

18
00:01:41,546 --> 00:01:42,979
Could l have a scone?

19
00:01:43,382 --> 00:01:46,249
-Want to hear some good news?
-ls somebody else gonna give it to us?

20
00:01:46,418 --> 00:01:49,546
Because you certainly don't seem like
you have any.

21
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:53,316
No, l do.
Someone l know is getting married.

22
00:01:53,492 --> 00:01:57,019
Weddings are happy occasions.
Oh, it's my ex-wife, Emily!

23
00:01:58,964 --> 00:01:59,953
Sorry, man.

24
00:02:00,165 --> 00:02:01,962
-Here's your scone.
-Thanks.

25
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,632
Stupid British snack food!

26
00:02:09,374 --> 00:02:11,934
Did they teach you that
in anger management?

27
00:02:13,612 --> 00:02:16,342
You know what might
help you deal with it?

28
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:19,948
You two are in the past.
You can't be mad about the past.

29
00:02:20,218 --> 00:02:24,052
Are you still mad about, you know,
the Louisiana Purchase?

30
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:27,390
Nobody's mad about that.

31
00:02:27,693 --> 00:02:30,321
Exactly!
Because it's in the past.

32
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:35,329
Anybody going to eat that?

33
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:43,371
Look at us all dressed up for the party.
What are we celebrating?

34
00:02:43,575 --> 00:02:46,408
We had a lot of liquor
left over from Christmas.

35
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:52,011
Our friends aren't here. We can be
a real couple. We don't have to hide.

36
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,081
l know. l can do this.

37
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,812
And l can do this.

38
00:02:58,557 --> 00:03:00,354
We can't do that.

39
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:03,088
Hey, Bing!

40
00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:08,021
Who's the pretty lady,
and what is she doing with you?

41
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:11,869
l asked myself
that very question, sir.

42
00:03:12,037 --> 00:03:13,026
My boss, Doug.

43
00:03:13,238 --> 00:03:14,865
-This is Monica.
-Hi.

44
00:03:15,073 --> 00:03:17,701
-This is my wife, Kara.
-Nice to meet you.

45
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:23,512
Did you hear about the new law firm
working for us?

46
00:03:23,715 --> 00:03:25,649
Dickem, Stickem & Run.

47
00:03:29,654 --> 00:03:31,519
Let's go drink our body weight.

48
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:35,457
What was that?

49
00:03:35,694 --> 00:03:36,786
That noise you made?

50
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:38,257
Oh, my work laugh.

51
00:03:38,997 --> 00:03:39,986
Your work laugh?

52
00:03:40,198 --> 00:03:44,134
lf you're going to survive this party,
come up with one too.

53
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:46,159
All right. Check me out.

54
00:03:47,806 --> 00:03:50,536
He says, '' $30, Father.
Same as in town.''

55
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:00,643
Everybody at work loved you last night.

56
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:04,054
And they like me more
just because l was with you.

57
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:07,223
You repaired the damage
from when they met Joey.

58
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,621
Doug wants to play tennis.
He never talks to me outside of work.

59
00:04:12,831 --> 00:04:15,163
Except for that time
at that strip club.

60
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:19,196
Strip church.

61
00:04:21,373 --> 00:04:24,137
-l'll go find a racket.
-l thought you had one.

62
00:04:24,376 --> 00:04:28,472
l used to, but then Joey thought
it'd be fun to go hit rocks...

63
00:04:28,713 --> 00:04:30,305
...at bigger rocks.

64
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,479
Do you have a tennis racket?

65
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:36,482
l lent it to Joey, and
l've never gotten it back.

66
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:38,749
Good luck with that.

67
00:04:43,428 --> 00:04:44,520
What's up?

68
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:47,323
Why are you here?
l thought you had inventory.

69
00:04:47,532 --> 00:04:49,932
l do, but l decided l'd take
a long lunch...

70
00:04:50,202 --> 00:04:52,762
...and spend some time
with my friend Monica.

71
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:56,533
You know, l feel like
we don't talk anymore.

72
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:58,072
How are you?

73
00:04:58,376 --> 00:04:59,934
What is new with you?

74
00:05:03,448 --> 00:05:05,712
Not much. Work's good.

75
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:09,080
We don't have to talk about work.
Talk about anything.

76
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,614
You know what?

77
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:16,050
Let's talk about relationships.

78
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:17,592
What's going on?

79
00:05:17,863 --> 00:05:19,262
Nothing.

80
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:21,221
You go.

81
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:26,068
There was this guy at the bank
that l thought was cute.

82
00:05:26,271 --> 00:05:27,761
But l don't anymore.

83
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,698
That's juicy.

84
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:35,242
You know what? l actually do
have a lot of work to do.

85
00:05:35,447 --> 00:05:38,814
You're sure there's just
not anything else?

86
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,608
l'm sure. ls there something
you want to talk to me about?

87
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:44,049
No!

88
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,619
lf there was, l wouldn't tell you.

89
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,901
Then what happened?

90
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:07,973
You'll get your turn.

91
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,946
-Hey, Pheebs. What's going on?
-Nothing.

92
00:06:11,316 --> 00:06:12,578
This is not over.

93
00:06:13,752 --> 00:06:15,743
No, no, no!

94
00:06:15,987 --> 00:06:19,423
l was up all night writing
this nasty letter to Emily.

95
00:06:19,624 --> 00:06:22,491
lt was perfect,
and now it's all covered in....

96
00:06:22,694 --> 00:06:24,355
Actually, thanks!

97
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:27,663
All right!
Ready to go to the movies?

98
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,962
Actually, l think l'll skip it.

99
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:31,329
Really?

100
00:06:31,503 --> 00:06:34,700
l'll read my book.
l just want to be alone right now.

101
00:06:35,206 --> 00:06:36,503
Sure you don't want to?

102
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:40,802
Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan.
They get mail and stuff.

103
00:06:42,614 --> 00:06:43,979
That's okay, Joe.

104
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:45,807
Let's go, Pheebs.

105
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,997
Game!

106
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:08,364
l got to tell you, that partner
of yours is a real tiger.

107
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:11,333
Are you all right?

108
00:07:13,578 --> 00:07:16,012
We'll just get
a little sip of water.

109
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:20,547
Am l on fire today or what?

110
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,880
Those birds are browned,
basted and ready to be carved.

111
00:07:25,757 --> 00:07:27,520
Okay, easy, Martina.

112
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,820
l think we should let them
win the next game.

113
00:07:32,063 --> 00:07:34,998
l'm sorry, l don't understand
what you just said.

114
00:07:36,334 --> 00:07:37,392
Let them win one.

115
00:07:37,602 --> 00:07:41,766
Are you crazy? We own those two.
Look at them!

116
00:07:42,107 --> 00:07:45,076
He can't even breathe,
and she's popping pills.

117
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:47,872
You're not giving them a chance.

118
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,569
They have rackets.

119
00:07:53,084 --> 00:07:54,881
We'll make this the last game.

120
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,088
Yes, sir. Put me out of my misery.

121
00:07:57,355 --> 00:07:59,346
Are you sure you never played pro?

122
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,118
Please let them win.

123
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:05,090
l'll take it down to 95%,
but that's the best l can do.

124
00:08:10,635 --> 00:08:12,796
-Missed it!
-l got it!

125
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:17,630
Nice shot.

126
00:08:27,152 --> 00:08:28,642
l got it!

127
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:31,279
Long!

128
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:39,959
l can't believe you let them win.

129
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:43,066
Well, at least you hid
your feelings well about it.

130
00:08:43,735 --> 00:08:44,827
l was frustrated.

131
00:08:45,036 --> 00:08:46,025
lt's my racket.

132
00:08:46,271 --> 00:08:47,431
Frustrated with you!

133
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:52,267
lf we hadn't lost, they would never have
invited us to dinner tomorrow.

134
00:08:52,477 --> 00:08:53,535
What bothers me...

135
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:56,179
...is how different
you act around them.

136
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:59,315
The throwing the tennis games,
the fake laugh...

137
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:03,078
...the ''See you later, Bing!''
''Not if l see you first, Doug!''

138
00:09:04,923 --> 00:09:07,892
Listen, l don't sound
like some crazed, drunken pirate.

139
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,651
l know you don't,
but ''work Chandler'' does.

140
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,560
l don't like work Chandler.
The guy's a suck-up.

141
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,233
Because you said that...

142
00:09:17,435 --> 00:09:19,300
...l'm not putting out tonight!

143
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:29,739
Something's wrong.
My brother doesn't stay out all night.

144
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:32,108
Maybe we should check
the trash chute.

145
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:36,083
Ross couldn't fit
down the trash chute.

146
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:38,517
That's right. He almost could.

147
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,258
Which is exactly
how l got stuck there.

148
00:09:44,362 --> 00:09:45,989
Oh, my God!

149
00:09:46,698 --> 00:09:48,359
Where the hell have you been?

150
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:51,462
Just, you know, out.

151
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:56,197
Oh, out! God, l don't know
why we didn't think to check there.

152
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:57,938
What were you doing?

153
00:09:58,143 --> 00:10:00,976
l went to a bar, and then...

154
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:04,546
...l just walked around for a while.

155
00:10:04,849 --> 00:10:08,012
You walked around all night
in the city by yourself?

156
00:10:09,787 --> 00:10:11,015
He hooked up!

157
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:14,322
He hooked up.

158
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:17,722
l don't have to answer your questions.
l'm a big boy.

159
00:10:17,962 --> 00:10:19,293
l can do what l want.

160
00:10:19,497 --> 00:10:20,794
He hooked up!

161
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:24,992
Tell us about her!

162
00:10:25,803 --> 00:10:27,236
Ross, you left your scarf--

163
00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:37,078
Hey, you guys.

164
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:46,623
l know what you all are thinking,
but Chandler is in Yemen.

165
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:51,622
l'm a young woman. l have needs.
l can't wait forever.

166
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:53,922
Yeah, that's what l was thinking.

167
00:10:55,967 --> 00:11:00,267
So l'm asking you, please,
just take a moment before you judge me.

168
00:11:00,505 --> 00:11:01,836
Nobody's judging you.

169
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:07,805
Mr. Right-place-at-the-right-time...

170
00:11:09,948 --> 00:11:11,313
...call me.

171
00:11:18,856 --> 00:11:21,518
So l guess you finished your book.

172
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:25,596
Had some time on our hands, did we?

173
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:29,823
l know what you guys are going to say.

174
00:11:30,034 --> 00:11:32,662
You two would have
very hairy children.

175
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:36,270
l didn't know you'd say that.

176
00:11:37,342 --> 00:11:39,276
Ross! Janice?

177
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,410
All right. Hold on, hold on.

178
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,442
This is Ross.

179
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:46,778
He's our friend.
He obviously went crazy.

180
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:49,042
He obviously lost his mind.

181
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:54,820
Look, it's not that crazy. Okay?

182
00:11:54,993 --> 00:11:57,928
But it's Janice! l mean, she's...

183
00:11:58,096 --> 00:11:59,996
...Janice!

184
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:02,523
How drunk were you?

185
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,861
Janice and l have a lot in common.

186
00:12:05,036 --> 00:12:09,166
We've both been divorced.
We both have kids.

187
00:12:09,374 --> 00:12:11,308
Are you going to see her again?

188
00:12:11,476 --> 00:12:14,309
-Don't put ideas in his head!
-l will see her.

189
00:12:14,512 --> 00:12:16,537
Damn it, Phoebe!

190
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:23,912
l have to tell you something
that l've never admitted.

191
00:12:24,155 --> 00:12:28,353
ln high school, l made out with James
even though l knew you liked him.

192
00:12:28,626 --> 00:12:31,823
That feels so good to get off my chest.
Okay, you go.

193
00:12:33,364 --> 00:12:35,924
My turn? What are you talking about?

194
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:40,337
l know about you and Chandler.

195
00:12:42,707 --> 00:12:45,107
l overheard you
on the phone the other day.

196
00:12:45,343 --> 00:12:49,541
You said, ''l'll tell Rachel l'm doing
laundry for a couple of hours.''

197
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:52,716
And he said, ''Laundry?
ls that my new nickname?''

198
00:12:52,984 --> 00:12:54,849
And you said:

199
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:59,046
''You know what
your nickname is, Mr. Big.''

200
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:07,664
You're writing yourself
a little play there, Rach.

201
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:12,230
Let me know how it turns out.

202
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,004
l wouldn't know, because l got
so freaked out l hung up the phone.

203
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:19,640
Well, if you had kept listening...

204
00:13:19,877 --> 00:13:23,472
...you would have heard me
call him Mister...

205
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:24,637
...Bigot.

206
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,545
Mr. Bigot.

207
00:13:29,654 --> 00:13:32,589
He tells the most racist jokes.

208
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:36,086
All right. So that's it.

209
00:13:36,361 --> 00:13:39,990
There's nothing going on
between you and Chandler?

210
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:42,526
Me and Chandler?

211
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:48,538
Put your $20 down.

212
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,709
First one to find
the tasty treat wins, okay?

213
00:13:52,243 --> 00:13:56,270
All right, let's get the contestants
out of their isolation booths.

214
00:13:57,415 --> 00:13:58,905
And they're off!

215
00:14:00,618 --> 00:14:02,779
Get your foot off my contestant!
Judge?

216
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:04,954
Judge rules, no violation.

217
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:14,394
lt's so weird to say this,
but l just had a great date with Janice.

218
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:16,897
-What?
-Are you serious?

219
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:21,069
l opened up to her about all
the stuff that's been happening to me.

220
00:14:21,272 --> 00:14:23,137
l mean, l talked for hours.

221
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:24,534
lt is amazing...

222
00:14:24,742 --> 00:14:28,269
...to have someone give you
such focused attention.

223
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:31,444
You don't need Janice for that.
You've got us.

224
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:33,446
The duck gets the Nutter Butter!

225
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:37,616
That's not a Nutter Butter.
That's an old won ton!

226
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:39,117
Judge rules...

227
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:40,914
...Nutter Butter.

228
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:43,092
Tough call.

229
00:14:47,665 --> 00:14:52,068
Seriously, l strongly believe that
we should support President Clinton...

230
00:14:52,637 --> 00:14:54,468
...and her husband, Bill.

231
00:14:57,308 --> 00:14:59,003
How do you like your coffee?

232
00:14:59,277 --> 00:15:01,177
-None for me.
-A little sugar.

233
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:04,973
l'll have Monica stick her finger in it.
That will sweeten it up.

234
00:15:09,587 --> 00:15:12,454
-That laugh doesn't give you a headache?
-You get used to it.

235
00:15:12,657 --> 00:15:14,090
l don't think that l can.

236
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:16,793
This will be it for me
on the work things.

237
00:15:17,028 --> 00:15:19,428
l laugh at my boss's jokes.
What's the big deal?

238
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,155
l'd rather not be with
this work-weasel guy...

239
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:25,596
...when l can be with my boyfriend,
who l actually respect.

240
00:15:30,007 --> 00:15:34,467
l got to apologize for Kara's coffee.
l'd feel sorry for it in a fight.

241
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:37,477
lt's not strong enough
to defend itself.

242
00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:42,950
Hear what l said?

243
00:15:43,955 --> 00:15:45,149
What?

244
00:15:46,057 --> 00:15:48,423
lt's a joke.
What's the matter with you?

245
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:51,686
Well, l just didn't think
it was funny, sir.

246
00:15:51,896 --> 00:15:52,954
Excuse me?

247
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:56,456
-Well, l just--
-Honey?

248
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:59,132
l just don't think
you understood the joke.

249
00:16:00,137 --> 00:16:01,126
Really?

250
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:05,240
l mean, it was really funny.
l just don't think that you got it.

251
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,979
You see, Kara's coffee
is weak-tasting.

252
00:16:09,247 --> 00:16:13,240
But what Doug did was imply
that it was weak physically.

253
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,550
-You get it now, honey?
-l think l do!

254
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,757
-Thank you, Monica.
-l thought you could use the help.

255
00:16:26,964 --> 00:16:29,057
Coffee in a fight!

256
00:16:34,438 --> 00:16:36,998
You mind if l read
my comic books in here?

257
00:16:38,976 --> 00:16:41,467
Sure. Why?

258
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:45,840
Chandler and Monica are over there.
lt's kind of hard to concentrate.

259
00:16:46,884 --> 00:16:50,445
She just called and said
she was going to be working late.

260
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:52,417
She keeps lying to me.

261
00:16:52,623 --> 00:16:56,684
That's it! l'm going over there
and confronting them right now.

262
00:16:59,363 --> 00:17:01,126
Panty raid.

263
00:17:12,176 --> 00:17:16,237
All right, so you're telling me
that l have to tell racist jokes now?

264
00:17:17,348 --> 00:17:19,316
l'm just not very good at this.

265
00:17:19,517 --> 00:17:22,350
l'm a terrible liar.
l hate having to lie to Rachel.

266
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:25,317
-But we're not ready to tell yet.
-l know.

267
00:17:25,523 --> 00:17:30,222
Ever since high school, Rachel was the
one person that l told everything to.

268
00:17:30,494 --> 00:17:32,519
l miss that so much now.

269
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,823
She's my best friend.

270
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,732
Oh, my God, Rachel!

271
00:17:49,246 --> 00:17:51,180
What are you doing here?

272
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:56,747
Well, l actually came over here
to borrow this lamp...

273
00:17:57,021 --> 00:17:59,512
...to look at my books.

274
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,758
You know, see them a little better.

275
00:18:03,427 --> 00:18:05,520
Okay, great.

276
00:18:06,731 --> 00:18:10,098
Well, what l was doing
in Chandler's room is that...

277
00:18:10,368 --> 00:18:11,596
...l was cleaning it.

278
00:18:13,237 --> 00:18:14,795
He pays me to clean it.

279
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,205
What a great way to make
some extra pocket money.

280
00:18:20,578 --> 00:18:23,809
When l said to you earlier
that l was at work...

281
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:25,742
...l'm at my new work.

282
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:28,716
Good enough. Right?

283
00:18:32,456 --> 00:18:34,117
l'll go look at my books.

284
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:38,652
Go get back to my new job.

285
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:47,135
Congratulations on your new job!

286
00:18:54,145 --> 00:18:56,340
Man, she is really gullible.

287
00:19:02,486 --> 00:19:04,647
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

288
00:19:04,922 --> 00:19:07,413
-Actually, l should get going.
-You're sure?

289
00:19:07,658 --> 00:19:09,785
l can stay out as late as you want.

290
00:19:10,027 --> 00:19:12,188
l told you l'm on
sabbatical from work--

291
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,921
Yes, yes. You did.

292
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:17,863
-Oh, man!
-What is wrong now?

293
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:20,962
This isn't what l ordered.

294
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:25,336
Man! Can't anything
go right in my life?

295
00:19:25,943 --> 00:19:29,106
First, my marriage falls apart,
and then--

296
00:19:29,313 --> 00:19:30,371
l know!

297
00:19:30,614 --> 00:19:33,208
You lose your apartment,
you lose your job...

298
00:19:33,484 --> 00:19:37,443
...your ex-wife gets married so fast!
And now the coffee!

299
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,221
We need to talk.

300
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,527
-Sometimes l feel--
-No, no, don't.

301
00:19:46,797 --> 00:19:48,731
l'm going to talk.

302
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:51,032
l believe...

303
00:19:51,302 --> 00:19:54,135
...that the sun has set...

304
00:19:54,338 --> 00:19:57,535
...on our day in the sun.

305
00:20:00,211 --> 00:20:03,510
You're a very sweet person, Ross.

306
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,547
Unfortunately...

307
00:20:07,852 --> 00:20:11,879
...l just don't think l can take
another second of you whining!

308
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:18,328
Let me make sure
l'm hearing this right.

309
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,922
You're ending this with me because...

310
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,690
...l'm too whiny?

311
00:20:28,172 --> 00:20:29,901
So you're saying...

312
00:20:30,174 --> 00:20:33,337
...l've become so whiny...

313
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:35,238
...that l...

314
00:20:35,513 --> 00:20:38,107
...annoy you...

315
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,011
...Janice.

316
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:42,547
Well, yeah!

317
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:45,344
Oh, my God!

318
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:49,351
Will you be okay?

319
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,255
l am now.

320
00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:05,432
l guess that's two out of three...

321
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:07,737
...Joey!

322
00:21:17,454 --> 00:21:19,479
Dude, we got to talk.

323
00:21:20,724 --> 00:21:24,490
l wanted to tell you something before
you heard it from someone else.

324
00:21:24,762 --> 00:21:27,629
l hope this isn't too weird, but...

325
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:31,727
...l had a thing with Janice.

326
00:21:36,574 --> 00:21:38,041
You're not mad?

327
00:21:38,242 --> 00:21:39,436
Why would l be mad?

328
00:21:39,643 --> 00:21:42,840
Because there's certain rules
about this kind of stuff.

329
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,777
You don't fool around with
your friends' ex-girlfriends...

330
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,413
...or possible girlfriends
or girls they're related to.

331
00:21:56,861 --> 00:21:58,351
l am mad.

332
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,598
But you know,
l'm going to forgive you.

333
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,824
Because that's what friends do.

334
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:09,301
They forgive their friends when
they do everything you just said.

335
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,802
Thank you.

336
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,702
But l want you to remember...

337
00:22:12,943 --> 00:22:15,309
...that l forgave you.

338
00:22:17,514 --> 00:22:21,780
l also want you to remember
that l let you live here rent-free.

339
00:22:22,286 --> 00:22:23,480
All right.

340
00:22:23,854 --> 00:22:27,312
And l want you to remember
that l gave you...

341
00:22:27,524 --> 00:22:29,355
...twenty-seven dollars.

342
00:22:30,794 --> 00:22:31,988
No strings attached!

343
00:22:32,196 --> 00:22:33,561
lf you can't remember that...

344
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:36,459
...we should write it down.
Let's write it down!
