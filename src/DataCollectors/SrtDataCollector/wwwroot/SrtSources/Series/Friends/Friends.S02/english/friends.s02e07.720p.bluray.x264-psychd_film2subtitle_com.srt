1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:06,171
Okay. What is it about me?
Do I not look fun enough?

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,675
Is there something
repellent about me?

3
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:11,593
How was the party?

4
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:15,180
It couldn't have been worse.
A woman literally passed through me.

5
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,308
So, what is it?
Am I hideously unattractive?

6
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:21,603
No, you are not.
You are very attractive.

7
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,605
I go through the exact same thing.

8
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:26,817
Every time I put on a little weight,
I question everything.

9
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:30,988
Whoa, whoa.

10
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,323
I've put on a little weight?

11
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,993
- Did you want to?
- Yeah, uh...

12
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,248
No, not weight. More like insulation.

13
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,711
Chandler, I'm unemployed,
in dire need of a project.

14
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,588
Wanna work out? I can remake you.

15
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:52,092
Uh, I would, but that might get
in the way of my lying-around time.

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,303
- Please?
- Come on, let her do it!

17
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,806
All right. But if we put on spandex...

18
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:01,018
...and my boobs are bigger than yours,
I'm going home.

19
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,396
Your boobs are fine.
Look, I never should have said anything.

20
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,648
Come here. Come here!

21
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,320
Ooh, can't make hands meet!

22
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,749
Okay! Let's do it.

23
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,672
What?

24
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:15,592
Nothing. Just never seen
you in little stretchy pants before.

25
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,304
And we're changing.

26
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,654
- Unh!
- Come on, give me five more!

27
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,824
- Ugh. Aah!
- Five more!

28
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,410
Five more and I'll flash you.

29
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,078
One...

30
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,789
...two...

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,709
...two and a half.

32
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,504
Just show me one of them.

33
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:01,680
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

34
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,145
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

35
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,690
She's insane! The woman is insane.

36
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,610
It's before work, after work,
and during work.

37
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:18,030
She's got me doing
butt-clenches at my desk.

38
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,240
And now they won't
bring me my mail anymore.

39
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,578
Hey, Pheebs. How'd it go with Scott?

40
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,081
Oh, um, it was nice.
Took him to a romantic restaurant...

41
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,167
...ordered champagne. Nice.

42
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,630
- The guy still won't put out?
- Nope. Zilch. Nothing. Uh-uh.

43
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,882
- Sorry, Pheebs.
- Sorry, Pheebs.

44
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,218
Well, look, I don't mind taking it slow.

45
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,677
I like him a lot.

46
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,972
He's really interesting,
and he's really sweet.

47
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,058
Why won't he give it up?

48
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,562
Maybe he, uh, drives his car
on the other side of the road.

49
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,522
If you know what I mean.

50
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,568
No. What do you mean?
He's not British.

51
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,741
- Maybe he's gay.
- Oh!

52
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,744
Um, no, I don't think that's the problem.

53
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,746
We went, um,
dancing the other night...

54
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:12,334
...and just the way he held me so close
and the way he was looking into my eyes...

55
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,920
...I just definitely felt something.

56
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,547
Yeah, but how much can you
tell from a look?

57
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,675
No, I felt it on my hip. I could tell.

58
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,764
Yo, Bing!
Racquetball in 20 minutes.

59
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,685
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand
and smack her with it.

60
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,311
Heh.

61
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,231
Ooh. Oh, Rachel! Don't look.

62
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,024
What?

63
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,987
Come on, guys.
I don't care. I have a date tonight.

64
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,655
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You have a date?

65
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,740
Yeah. Monica's setting me up.

66
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,743
Heh, now, what about, uh, Ross and...

67
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,246
What? My whole
insane jealousy thing?

68
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,999
Well, you know,
as much fun as that was...

69
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,418
...I've decided to opt for sanity.

70
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,712
So you're okay about all this?

71
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,131
Oh, yeah, come on! I'm moving on.

72
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,010
He can press her up against
that window as much as he wants.

73
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,972
For all I care, he can throw her
through the damn thing.

74
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,975
- Hi, guys.
Hey.

75
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,313
Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow
and pick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?

76
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,231
Only if you say his full name.

77
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:22,112
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up
Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?

78
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,741
- All right.
- You're getting a cat?

79
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:29,036
Actually, we're getting a cat. Heh.

80
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,829
- Together?
- Uh-huh.

81
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,123
- Both of you? Together?
Yup.

82
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,959
It'll live with Ross half the time
and me half the time.

83
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,546
Oh, well, isn't that just lovely?

84
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:43,216
Ha, ha. That's something
the two of you will be able to enjoy...

85
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,011
...for a really, really, really long time.

86
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,763
- Hopefully.
Oh, wow.

87
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,308
Whoa! Look at that.
I gotta go! I got a date!

88
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,977
With a man. Ahem, okay.

89
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,438
You guys have a really, uh, good night...

90
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:00,650
...and you two have a, uh,
really good cat. Heh.

91
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,407
We're not supposed to
take these when we leave.

92
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,041
I don't know if Monica told you...

93
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,544
...but this the first date I've gone on
since my divorce.

94
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,671
So if I seem a little nervous...

95
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,006
...I am.

96
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,384
How long do cats live?

97
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,430
- I'm sorry?
- Cats. How long do they live?

98
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,600
Figuring you don't throw them
under a bus or something?

99
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,896
Um, maybe 15, 16 years.

100
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,399
Well, that's just great.

101
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,318
- Um, cheers.
- Mm.

102
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,362
Right. Clink. Heh.

103
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,663
Monica told you I was cuter
than this, didn't she?

104
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,752
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you.
Sorry. It's just...

105
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,339
It's this thing.
It's probably not as bad as it sounds...

106
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:08,301
...but this friend of mine
is getting a cat with his girlfriend.

107
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,429
Oh, that does sound...

108
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:16,017
- Huh.
- He just started going out with her.

109
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:19,729
Ahem. Is this guy, uh, an old boyfriend?

110
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,733
Yeah, he wishes.

111
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,488
Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me.

112
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,575
Okay, Michael, let's talk about you.

113
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,953
- All right.
- Okay. Okay?

114
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,830
So...

115
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,501
Did you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?

116
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,089
- So I figured it out.
- What?

117
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,508
Why Scott doesn't want
to sleep with me.

118
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,093
I'm not sexy enough.

119
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,638
Heh, Phoebe, that's crazy.

120
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,349
When I first met you,
you know what I said to Chandler?

121
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,853
- Mm-mm.
- I said, "Excellent butt, great rack. "

122
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,649
Really? That's so sweet.

123
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,906
I mean, I'm officially offended.
But that's so sweet.

124
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,827
Look, if you wanna know what the deal is,
you're gonna have to ask him.

125
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,705
You're right. You're right.

126
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,540
Ugh, you are so yum!

127
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,689
I mean, it's a cat, you know?
It's a cat.

128
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,569
Why can't they get one of those bugs?
One of those fruit flies.

129
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,905
Those things that live for a day.

130
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,115
What are they called?
What are they called?

131
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,369
- Fruit flies?
- Yes!

132
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,038
- Thank you.
- Would you like any dessert?

133
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,666
No! No dessert.

134
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,085
Just the check. Please.

135
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,922
Oh, no. You're not having fun, are you?

136
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,757
No, no, I am.

137
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:15,762
But only because I've been playing
the movie Diner in my head.

138
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,932
Oh, look at me.

139
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,600
Look at me.

140
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,354
Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy.

141
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,815
All I can think about is Ross...

142
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,900
...and his cat...

143
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,610
...and his Julie.

144
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,323
I just want to get over him.
God, why can't I do that?

145
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,950
Oy.

146
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,996
Look, I've been through a divorce.
Trust me, you're gonna be fine.

147
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,957
You can't see it because
you haven't had closure...

148
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,166
Aah!

149
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,835
Closure!

150
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,421
That's what it is. That's what I need.

151
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,423
God, you're brilliant!

152
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,844
Why didn't I think of that?
How do I get that?

153
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,641
Well, there's no one way
really, it's just...

154
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,978
Whatever it takes so that
you can finally say to him:

155
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,354
"I'm over you. "

156
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,358
Over you. That's what it is.

157
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,903
Closure.

158
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,573
Hello? Excuse me?

159
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,743
Excuse me. Hel... Whoo!

160
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,244
- Hang on.
- Hello? Excuse me?

161
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,163
- What?
- Hi. I'm sorry.

162
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,750
I need to borrow your phone
for just one minute.

163
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,085
- I'm talking.
- I see that.

164
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:33,965
It's one phone call, I'll be very quick.
I'll even pay for it myself.

165
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,844
Okay, you're being a little weird
about your phone.

166
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,350
All right. Fine.

167
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,644
I'll call you back.

168
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,105
Thank you.

169
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,776
Okay.

170
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,615
Machine.

171
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,910
- Just waiting for the beep.
- Good.

172
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,623
Ross! Hi, it's Rachel.

173
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,376
I'm just calling to say that, um...

174
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,877
...everything's fine.

175
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,296
And I'm really happy for you...

176
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,674
...and your cat.

177
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:20,261
Who, by the way,
I think you should name Michael.

178
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,475
And you see there,
I'm thinking of names...

179
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,020
...so obviously I am over you.

180
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,399
I am over you.

181
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:37,821
And that, my friend,
is what they call "closure. "

182
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,750
No, no, no, no, no, no. No.

183
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,422
Monica, it's Sunday morning.
I'm not running on a Sunday.

184
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,258
- Why not?
- Because it's Sunday!

185
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,177
It's God's day.

186
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,098
Ha, hey. If you say stop, then we stop.

187
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,474
Ha, ha, okay.

188
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,853
- Stop.
- No, come on! We can't stop!

189
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,980
We got three more pounds to go!

190
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,983
I am the energy train
and you are on board!

191
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,828
Whoo.

192
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,460
- Hey, Rach.
- Mm.

193
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,379
- Oh. And how was the date?
- Ugh.

194
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,758
Um, I think there was a restaurant.

195
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,926
I know there was wine.

196
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,554
Wow. Well, uh...

197
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,223
Uh, actually, Julie's getting a cab.

198
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:50,602
I just need the cat toys.
Did Monica say?

199
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,438
What? Why are you
looking at me like that? Heh.

200
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,024
Ahem, I'm sorry. I don't know, I...

201
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,902
I feel like I had a dream
about you last night...

202
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,445
...but I don't remember.

203
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,490
Okay.

204
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,158
Heh. Oh, oh, oh.

205
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,285
- There they are.
- Ahem.

206
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,330
Did we speak on the phone?
Did you call me?

207
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,916
No. I stayed at Julie's last night.

208
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,586
- Huh.
- Oh, I haven't even been home yet.

209
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,588
Do you mind if I check my messages?

210
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,423
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

211
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,387
Rach, I got a message from you!

212
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,937
- Who's Michael?
- Oh, my God.

213
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,481
God, Ross, no! Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone!

214
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,359
Give me the phone! Give me the phone!
Give me the phone!

215
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,236
Give me the...

216
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,743
You're over me?

217
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,703
Oh, God.

218
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,081
- Wha...? You're, uh...
- Oh, God.

219
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,251
- You're over me?
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

220
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,504
Oh, my God. Oh...

221
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,216
When...? When were you...

222
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,051
...under me?

223
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,473
Rach.

224
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,308
Rachel, do you?

225
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,894
I mean, were you, uh...?

226
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,564
Ugh. Okay. Okay, okay.
- What?

227
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,567
Well, basically...

228
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,403
...ahem, lately, I've, uh...

229
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,991
Ahem, I've sort of had feelings for you.

230
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,789
You've had feelings for me?

231
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,125
Yeah, so? You had feelings for me first.

232
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,294
Whoa, huh.

233
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,506
You know about my...?
You know I had...?

234
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,508
You know?

235
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,887
- Chandler told me.
- When did he...?

236
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,930
When did he...? When did he?

237
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,518
- When you were in China.
- China.

238
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,645
- Meeting Julie.
- Julie.

239
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,607
Julie. That's... Oh, God.

240
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,067
Julie? Julie, right.

241
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,570
Okay, I need to lie down.

242
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,073
- No, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand...
- Okay.

243
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,076
...and I'm gonna walk.
I'm walking and I am standing.

244
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,745
Okay, so you, uh?

245
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,372
And now, what? Now...? Now.

246
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,207
Now you're over me?

247
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,420
Are you over me?

248
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:36,184
That's... That's Julie. That's Julie. Julie.

249
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,937
- Hi, Julie.
Honey, I've got a cab waiting.

250
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,980
I'll be right down!

251
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,569
Wait, so you're going?

252
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:50,490
Well, okay, I, uh... I have to.
I can't deal with this right now.

253
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,909
I mean, I've, uh... Heh.
You know, I've got a cab.

254
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,371
I've got a girlfriend.
I'm gonna go get a cat.

255
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,332
Okay. Okay.

256
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,668
Cat!

257
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,728
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

258
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,608
How come you're watching
a rabbi play electric guitar?

259
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,153
I can't find the remote.

260
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,367
Ugh, thank you. Heh.

261
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,996
So, Scott asked me to come over
for lunch and I did.

262
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,999
- And?
- And we did.

263
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,502
- All right, Pheebs! Way to go!
- Yay, me. Ha, ha.

264
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,171
So how did it happen?

265
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,174
I took your advice and
asked him what was going on.

266
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,676
What did he say?

267
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:56,222
He said he understands how sex can be
a very emotional thing for a woman.

268
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,308
And he was just afraid
that I was going to get all, you know:

269
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,562
"Is he gonna call me the next day?"
And "Where is this going?" and:

270
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:09,152
So he said he wanted to hold off
until he was prepared to be serious.

271
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,154
- Wow.
- Yeah.

272
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:15,658
So I said, "Okay. Relax, please. "
You know?

273
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:20,663
I mean, sex can be just about two people
right there in the moment.

274
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:24,834
If he wants to see me again,
he can call. If not, that's fine too.

275
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,921
So after a lot of talking, heh...

276
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,550
...I convinced him. Heh!

277
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,014
Let me get this straight.

278
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,267
He got you to beg to sleep with him.

279
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,062
He got you to say
he never has to call you again.

280
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,941
And he got you thinking
this is a great idea?

281
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,736
Uh-huh.

282
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,281
This man is my god.

283
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,467
- Hi.
- I didn't get a cat.

284
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,597
Oh, that's, um, interesting.

285
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,643
No. No, it's not interesting.
Okay? It's very, very not interesting.

286
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,896
It's actually a hundred percent
the opposite of interesting.

287
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,397
I got it, Ross.

288
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:31,234
You had no right to tell me
you had feelings for me.

289
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,528
- What?
- I was doing great with Julie...

290
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,196
...before I found out about you.

291
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,532
I was doing great before
I found out about you!

292
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,951
You think it's easy for me
to see you with Julie?

293
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,203
You should've said something
before I met her.

294
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,706
I didn't know then. And how come
you never said anything to me?

295
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,458
There was never a good time.

296
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:51,045
You only had a year.
And we only hung out every night!

297
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,172
Not... Not... Not...

298
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,757
...every night.

299
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,137
It's not like I didn't try.
But things got in the way.

300
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,055
You know, like Italian guys...

301
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,725
...or ex-fiancés, or... Or... Or...

302
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,228
Italian guys.

303
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,567
There was one Italian guy, okay?
And do you have a point?

304
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,653
The point is, I don't need this right now!

305
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,613
Okay? It's too late.

306
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,741
I'm with somebody else.
I'm happy. This ship has sailed!

307
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:24,162
You're just gonna put away feelings
or whatever it was you felt for me?

308
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,998
I've done it since ninth grade.
I've gotten good at it.

309
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,667
All right, fine.
You go ahead and do that, Ross.

310
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,210
I don't need your stupid ship!

311
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,212
- Good.
- Good!

312
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,257
And you know what? Now I got closure!

313
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,103
Try the bottom one.

314
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:03,511
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.

315
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,430
We're not working out. It's over.

316
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,350
No way! With one pound to go?
Come on!

317
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:13,312
We're workin', we're movin'
We're in the zone, we're groovin'

318
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,232
Okay, I don't mind the last pound.

319
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,318
In fact, I kind of like the last pound.

320
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,322
So don't make me do anything
that I'll regret.

321
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,410
Ha, oh, what you gonna do, fat boy, huh?
Ha, ha.

322
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,120
What? Heh.

323
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:35,167
Nothing. Except tell you, uh, it's
wonderful how much energy you have.

324
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,295
Well, thanks.

325
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,965
Especially considering how tough
it's been for you to find work.

326
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,551
Well, you know. Heh.

327
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,844
You know, I mean...

328
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:50,099
...you can't tell your parents you were fired,
because they'd be disappointed.

329
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,601
Uh-huh.

330
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:56,439
It's not as if you have
a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.

331
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,443
- Well, no. But I...
- I mean...

332
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,946
...if it were me, I'd have difficulty
getting out of bed at all.

333
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,747
You know, I try to stay positive.

334
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,665
So you?

335
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,752
You feel like going for a run?

336
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,131
All right.

337
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:27,428
Because you don't have to.
You could just take a nap right here.

338
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,639
Okay.

339
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,268
- Just for a little while.
- Okay.
