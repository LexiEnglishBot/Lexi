1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,964
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

2
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,050
None of that.
Not while you're living under my roof.

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,052
What?

4
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:16,306
Look, just because I know about you two
doesn't mean I like looking at it.

5
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:19,226
Aren't you supposed to be
at an audition for another hour?

6
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:22,354
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not
a middle-aged black woman.

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,235
And I'm also sorry if sometimes
I go to the wrong audition.

8
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,614
Okay, look, if I have to pretend
I don't know about you two...

9
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:36,118
...then you two are gonna have to pretend
there's nothing to know about.

10
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,871
Okay, sorry.

11
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,545
I can hear that.

12
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,882
Rachel's at work.

13
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,598
I can still hear you.

14
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,564
- Hey.
- Hey.

15
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,941
Hey. What's that?

16
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:53,028
Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom
that once belonged to my grandmother.

17
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,279
Can you believe it?

18
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,073
A year ago I didn't even have a family...

19
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,492
...and now I have heirlooms
for crying out loud.

20
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,963
- Oh, God!
- Aah!

21
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,133
Oh, soft.

22
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,718
- Is this mink?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:22,057
Why would my mother send me a fur?
Doesn't she know me but at all?

24
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:27,062
Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that
no innocent animals suffered to make.

25
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,274
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids
who worked their fingers bloody...

26
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,025
...for 12 cents an hour.

27
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,530
That didn't happen, I made that up.

28
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,368
- Hey.
- Ross?

29
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,163
Ross, you can't put up flyers in here.

30
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,373
How come? Everybody else does.

31
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,792
You can't.

32
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,921
What is that?

33
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:57,009
Oh, uh, I'm getting rid
of a couple of things.

34
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,219
This is all of your things.

35
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,306
Yes, yes, it is.

36
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,351
No, but it's good. Emily thinks
we should get all new stuff.

37
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,563
Stuff that's just ours.
Together, you know, brand new.

38
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,733
So basically this is a "getting rid
of anything Rachel ever touched" sale.

39
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,736
Touched, used, sat on, slept on...

40
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,738
I'll take it all.

41
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,949
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?

42
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,035
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants...

43
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,038
...and get her to New York,
I'm sure everything will be fine.

44
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,290
Okay, but don't you think
that's a little extreme?

45
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,669
- After what I did, can you blame her?
- Oh, my God. You got off easy.

46
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,505
When my friend Sylvie's husband
said someone else's name in bed...

47
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,258
...she cursed him
and turned his thingy green.

48
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,100
What is he doing?

49
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:51,521
Emily thinks Ross' furniture
has got Rachel cooties?

50
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,649
- Calm down, Joey.
- No.

51
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,984
Everything's getting all messed up,
you know?

52
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,986
Emily won't let Ross see Rachel.

53
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:02,950
We're not gonna stop seeing Rachel,
hence, Ross stops seeing us.

54
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,535
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.

55
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,413
Yeah, I know.
We're losing Ross, Joey said "hence."

56
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:17,089
I'm not happy about this either, but,
you know, if Ross says he's happy...

57
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,300
...then we just have to keep our feelings
about Emily to ourselves.

58
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,843
Are you cool with that?

59
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,512
No.

60
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,432
But, you know, I'm an actor.

61
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,476
I'll act cool.

62
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:39,945
Ooh. Oh, God,
storage rooms give me the creeps.

63
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,364
Monica, please, hurry up, honey, please.

64
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,074
If you want the little round waffles...

65
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,202
...you've gotta wait till I find
the little round waffle iron.

66
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,205
- I want the little round waffles.
- All right.

67
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,415
Here it is.

68
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,210
Right underneath the can of bug bomb.

69
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,923
I wonder if the best place to put something
that cooks food is underneath the poison?

70
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,968
Okay, you know what? I'll have toast.

71
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,017
Fog him! Fog him!

72
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,692
I don't know what I'm gonna do
about this coat.

73
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,360
I'll take it.

74
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,989
- That might work.
- Oh, yeah, ha, ha.

75
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,412
Huh? All right, what do you think?

76
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,873
You're on in five, Ms. Minnelli.

77
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,128
No, no, no, it's just a bit sudden.

78
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,214
No, it's great, okay?
I am totally on board.

79
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,633
I love you too. All right, bye.

80
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:51,016
- What's the matter, Ross?
- Nothing. No. Oh, uh, actually...

81
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,851
...great news. Heh.

82
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,603
Um, just got off the phone with Emily...

83
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,981
...and looks like I'm moving
to a new apartment.

84
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,399
Whoo-hoo!

85
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,905
- Why?
- Well, her thought is... And I agree.

86
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:09,409
- Fresh new furniture,
why not a fresh new apartment?

87
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,370
Her cousin has this great place to sublet.

88
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,498
It's got a view of the river on one side
and Columbia on the other.

89
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,000
That's way uptown.
That's like three trains away...

90
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,919
...which is great.

91
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,213
I love to ride that rail.

92
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,591
So you're really okay with this?

93
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,511
Yes, yes. I mean,
it's kind of far from work...

94
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,972
...but, uh, you know,
I'll get so much done on the commute.

95
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,851
I've been given the gift of time.

96
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,980
That's so funny, because last Christmas
I got the gift of space.

97
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,068
We should get them together
and make a continuum.

98
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,573
Now he's moving?

99
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,411
Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!

100
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,913
He's not even here.

101
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,958
You guys. You guys.

102
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,920
We were just in the storage area
and we saw this really creepy man.

103
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,840
He was like this crazy-eyed,
hairy beast-man.

104
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,593
He was like a Bigfoot
or a yeti or something.

105
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,764
He came at us with an ax,
so Rachel had to use the bug bomb on him.

106
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:16,351
Yeah, I pulled the tab
and I just fogged his yeti ass.

107
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,814
Uh, like, dark hair, bushy beard?

108
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,483
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you fogged Danny.

109
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:28,029
Ugh, please. We did not fog Danny.

110
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,614
Who's Danny?

111
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,741
Danny just moved in downstairs.

112
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:36,580
He just got back from this four-month trek
in the Andes. Nice fella.

113
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:40,083
Oh, he's nice. He's nice.
You know, you always...

114
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,003
...stick up for the people we fog.

115
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,222
- Yeah?
- Hi.

116
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,643
You might not remember us,
but we are the girls that fogged you.

117
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,563
- We're really sorry we fogged you.
- Yeah.

118
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,773
Okay.

119
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,074
Hi, uh, just so you know,
we didn't mean to fog you.

120
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,495
We actually thought you were
like a yeti or something.

121
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,663
Okay.

122
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,169
Yes?

123
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,421
Hi. Ahem, sorry to bother you...

124
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,925
...but I don't think that we can accept
your acceptance of our apology.

125
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,928
It just doesn't really seem
like you mean it.

126
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,597
Okay.

127
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,019
Wow. That guy is so rude.

128
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,688
Really. What is with that guy?

129
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,149
I mean, you'd forgive me
if I fogged you.

130
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,235
Well, you did, a little bit.

131
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,905
Oh, my God, honey. I'm so sorry.

132
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,449
- I totally forgive you.
- Really?

133
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,206
- Hey.
- Hey.

134
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,626
So listen, you know my friend Chris
who owns the crematorium?

135
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,254
Crematorium Chris? Sure.

136
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,675
Well, he said that he would cremate
my fur coat for free...

137
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,387
...if I, um, you know, bring in
the next person I know who dies.

138
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,600
Oh, my God.

139
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,103
Oh, my God. Look at these pelts.

140
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,523
Don't get too attached.
She's having it cremated.

141
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,066
Wha...?

142
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,652
Phoebe? Ha. Honey?

143
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,739
Honey, I know you're quirky, and I get
a big kick out of it. We all do, actually.

144
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,992
But if you destroy a coat like this...

145
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,662
...I mean, that is like a crime
against nature.

146
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,290
Not nature. Fashion.

147
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,208
This is fashion?

148
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,794
Okay, so to you, death is fashion?

149
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,798
That's really funny.
Yeah, here's Phoebe, uh...

150
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,260
...sporting, you know,
cutting-edge hairy carcass...

151
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:59,472
...from, you know,
the steel traps of wintry Russia.

152
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,101
I mean, you really think this looks good?

153
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,437
Because I do.

154
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,446
I know, I miss you too.
I can't wait to see you.

155
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,156
I love you. Bye.

156
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,366
Okay, what is in here, rocks?

157
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,911
No, this is my collection
of, uh, fossil samples.

158
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,955
So rocks.

159
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,342
I'm really gonna miss this apartment.
Heh.

160
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,638
You know, Ben took his first steps
right over there.

161
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,392
Hey, remember when I ran into this thing
and it kind of knocked me out a little?

162
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,937
I love this place.

163
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,899
To tell you the truth,
I wish I didn't have to move.

164
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:56,321
Uh, are you saying that you're not
entirely happy about this?

165
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,032
Well, I mean, if, uh,
Emily gave me a choice...

166
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,326
You do have a choice.

167
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,996
Ross, why are you listening to her?
Are you crazy?

168
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,498
What?

169
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:10,418
It's not right what Emily wants you to do.
She is totally... Ow!

170
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,712
Stop pinching me.

171
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:17,634
You guys said I only had to keep my mouth
shut as long as Ross was happy, right?

172
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,971
Well, he just told me
that he's not entirely happy.

173
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,684
What's going on?

174
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,018
We all hate Emily.

175
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,816
- No.
- No, Ross, we do not hate Emily.

176
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,985
We just think that
you're having to sacrifice...

177
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,113
...a whole lot to make her happy.

178
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,656
Yeah.

179
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:44,411
We just think that maybe
she's being a little unreasonable.

180
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,579
Yes, yes, unreasonable.

181
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,873
Unreasonable?

182
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,711
How about we have this conversation
when one of you guys gets married?

183
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,840
You have no idea what it takes
to make a marriage work.

184
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,634
It's about compromise.
Do you always like it? No.

185
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,969
Do you do it? Yes.

186
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,514
Because it's not all laughing,
happy, candy in the sky...

187
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,976
...drinking coffee at Central Perk
all the time. It's real life, okay?

188
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,396
It's what grownups do.

189
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,571
I think he's right.

190
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,073
You guys hang out at the coffeehouse
way too much.

191
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,417
- God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
- Ugh, I know.

192
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,336
I kind of feel like it's my fault.

193
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,299
Kind of?

194
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,552
If you just kept this to yourself,
none of this would have happened.

195
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,221
Well, I'm keeping so many things
to myself these days...

196
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,056
...something was bound to slip out.

197
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,811
Well, I think it's very brave
what you said.

198
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:57,692
I can't sit here anymore.
I have to walk places.

199
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,571
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat?
How about the whole animal rights thing?

200
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,949
Well, ahem, I've been reading up,
and for your information...

201
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,993
...minks are not very nice.

202
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,664
Okay, I admit it.
I love this coat, okay?

203
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:16,294
It's the best thing I've ever had wrapped
around me, including Phil Huntley.

204
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,173
Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine.

205
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,727
Hi.

206
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,941
- So you like the short hair better?
- What?

207
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,904
Yeti? Uh, Danny?

208
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,492
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the, uh...

209
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,744
...fogger smell.
- Oh.

210
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:54,040
Listen, I'm so sorry.
I would have never fogged you...

211
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,544
...you know, if you hadn't looked so...
You know, um...

212
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,548
Absolutely. Some people
are just into appearances.

213
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,259
- What?
- That's cool. That's cool.

214
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,095
What...? Hey, whoa, no, no, no,
that is not cool.

215
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,721
You don't even know me.

216
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,933
Come on. You got the shopping bags
and the Saks catalogue.

217
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:16,229
So from that, you think
you've got me all figured out?

218
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,772
Well, you don't.

219
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:22,318
You know, I could have toys
for underprivileged kids in here.

220
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,487
Do you?

221
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:28,366
Well, you know,
if kids like to play with capri pants.

222
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,577
Okay.

223
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,080
And stop saying that. I hate that.

224
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,748
Okay.

225
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,345
Fine. I judged you.
I made a snap judgment.

226
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,097
But you did it too, and you're worse...

227
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,975
...because you are sticking
to your stupid snap judgment.

228
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,437
You can't even open up your mind for a
second to see that you might be wrong.

229
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,147
What does that say about you?

230
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,692
That pizza place
across the street any good?

231
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,736
- What?
- I'm hungry.

232
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,614
You wanna get some pizza?
You can keep yelling if there's more.

233
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,782
Okay.

234
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,245
- Okay.
- Stop saying that. I hate that.

235
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,959
Uh, Ross?

236
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,337
- Are you still mad at us?
- Yup.

237
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,048
Oh, good, because we have
an "I'm Sorry" song. Ha, ha.

238
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,300
You know what?
I'm really not in the mood.

239
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,886
Look, Ross.

240
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:34,891
I feel really bad. I mean,
you're going through all this stuff...

241
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,226
...and I just acted like a jerk.

242
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:41,356
- Yeah, we are so sorry.
- You're stepping on the song.

243
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:46,152
Look, we were way out of line, all right?
We totally support you.

244
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,446
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.

245
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,741
Okay, now you're just taking lines
right out of the song.

246
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:56,829
Look, this is hard enough, okay?
I really need you guys right now.

247
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,124
Yes, exactly. And that's why...

248
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,088
Why don't you come over tonight,
and I'll make you your favorite dinner?

249
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,215
Come on.

250
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,634
Okay.

251
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,636
Thanks, you guys.

252
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,346
Pheebs, are you wearing fur?

253
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,598
Okay, let's get some perspective, people.

254
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,102
It's not like I'm wearing
a seeing-eye dog coat.

255
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:27,652
You know, Ross, I, uh, think I kind of
understand why I lost it today.

256
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,613
- You do, huh?
- Yeah, you see, um...

257
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,991
...I'm an actor, right?

258
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,828
So I gotta keep my emotions
right at the surface, you know?

259
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,456
I got a lot of balls in the air,
you know what I mean?

260
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:47,255
It's tough. Guys like me, you know,
you wander around, you're alone.

261
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,758
What are you talking about?

262
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,720
I'm not sure.

263
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,807
- Hi.
- Hey, look at you. Where have you been?

264
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,727
Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.

265
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,815
- How did that happen?
- That yeti is one smooth talker.

266
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,318
I hope you're not too full,
because dinner's almost ready.

267
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,739
Yeah, you know, I think I'm probably
just gonna hang out in my room.

268
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,115
- Oh, no.
- Why?

269
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,575
Come on, you guys.

270
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,870
Listen, if Emily knew I was here having
dinner with you, she would flip out...

271
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,663
...and you know it.

272
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,917
It's okay. I really... I don't mind.

273
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,920
Wait, wait, wait. You know what?
Just stay.

274
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,839
Please.

275
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,675
It would really mean a lot for me
if you stay.

276
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,344
Ross, I just...

277
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,973
Rachel, please, just have dinner with us.

278
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,143
Okay, Joey, it's okay. Settle down.

279
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,812
All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

280
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,106
You see, Rach, I'm an actor.

281
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,655
Hey. Hey, look. Ugly naked guy's back.

282
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,826
We haven't seen him in so long.

283
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,538
Oh, God.
I really missed that fat bastard.

284
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,960
Wow. This is so weird.

285
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,923
I just realized this may be the last time
we're all hanging out together.

286
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,842
It's almost as if he knew.

287
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,013
I'll get it.

288
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,142
Hello?

289
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,478
Hi, Emily.

290
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,565
Yeah, uh, you tracked him down.
Hold on one second.

291
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,902
Hey.

292
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:37,532
Yeah, yeah, we're, uh, just having dinner.

293
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,659
Uh, yeah, sure, hold on.

294
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,452
She wants to say hi. Hold on.

295
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,957
Hi, Emily.

296
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,625
Hello, everyone.

297
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,919
So who am I saying hello to?

298
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,964
Well, uh, I don't know
about who's here...

299
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,884
...but I can tell you for damn sure
who's not here, and that's Rachel.

300
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:03,015
Well, I should hope not.
Ross knows better than that by now.

301
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,063
You know what? Uh, Rachel is here.

302
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,023
She's there?

303
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,234
Oh, yeah, there she is.

304
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,946
Yeah. Yeah, she's here.

305
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,906
Ross, take me off speakerphone.

306
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,536
- Hi.
- How could you do this to me?

307
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,581
I thought I'd made my feelings
about Rachel perfectly clear.

308
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,793
Look, Emily, I'm just having dinner
with my friends, okay?

309
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,380
- You obviously can't keep away from her.
- That's ridiculous.

310
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:38,885
Look, I'm moving for you.
I'm cutting friends out of my life for you.

311
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:42,471
Please, just get on the plane
and come to New York, okay?

312
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,975
You'll see you're the only person
I want to be with.

313
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:50,438
I'll feel better when I'm there
and I can know where you are all the time.

314
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:57,195
Well, you can't know where I am
all the time.

315
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,949
Look, this marriage is never gonna work
if you don't trust me.

316
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,161
You're right.

317
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:10,166
So... can you trust me?

318
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,214
No.

319
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,594
I think it's going okay.

320
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,596
Looks like he's smiling.

321
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,682
How can you tell?
You can only see the back of his head.

322
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,310
You can totally tell.

323
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,978
Here, look, watch me.

324
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:37,777
Smile. Frown. Smile. Frown. Smile.

325
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,125
Well, I guess that's it.

326
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,962
Why? What happened?

327
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,797
My marriage is over.

328
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,549
- What?
- Oh, sweetie.

329
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,552
Oh, look at you, you're shivering.

330
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,846
Here.

331
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,311
Ross, honey,
is there anything we can do?

332
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,564
Yeah.

333
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,027
You can help me
get my furniture back from Gunther.

334
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,883
Okay, stop tormenting me.

335
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:48,639
This is mink, okay?
They're mean, and they hate squirrels.

336
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,892
And, you know, most of these
