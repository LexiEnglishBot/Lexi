1
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:07,672
So what do you think?

2
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:10,101
Casa de Joey.

3
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,402
- I decorated it myself.
- Get out!

4
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:17,375
Wow, Joey, this is...

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,244
- Art.
- Art it is.

6
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,888
Check this out!
Is it a coffee table?

7
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:27,352
Is it a panther?
There's no need to decide.

8
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,361
Hey, nice pillow.

9
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,459
So tell me,
is this genuine Muppet skin?

10
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,696
Hey, excellent water, table thing.

11
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:41,202
Thanks. I love this.
But you know what?

12
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,466
It makes me want to pee.

13
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:47,245
Yeah, me too.
I think that's the challenge.

14
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,776
How come Chandler didn't come?

15
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,946
It's because he had
a thing with the...

16
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,223
...with the thing.

17
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,360
Right. I got it.

18
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:05,795
So why don't you show us
the rest of your casa?

19
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,332
The best part! Come on.

20
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,979
Nice toilet.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,913
No, no, no. Behind it.

22
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,742
- You have a phone in here?
- That's right.

23
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:26,212
I have a phone.

24
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,781
In here.

25
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,253
Joey, promise me something.

26
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,719
Never call me from that phone.

27
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:39,830
The One Where Eddie Moves In

28
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,416
Okay, here we go.

29
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:37,356
Sorry, they were all out of apple pie.
Someone just got the last piece.

30
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:41,352
Oh, my God!
You won't believe this!

31
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,362
I have just been discovered.

32
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,568
Wait a minute. I claimed you
in the name of France four years ago.

33
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,271
Anyway.

34
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:58,236
Don't freak out and say how
great this is until I'm done.

35
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,948
I just met this producer
of this teeny record company...

36
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,150
...who said that I have
a very fresh, offbeat sound...

37
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,547
...and she wants to do
a demo of "Smelly Cat."

38
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,717
Okay, I told you not to do that yet.

39
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,893
And she wants to do a video.

40
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,793
I'm not done yet, okay?

41
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,169
God!

42
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:28,671
If that goes well,
they may even want to make an album.

43
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,473
I'm done now.

44
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,916
If you care about me,
get the pie out of the man's hood.

45
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,815
- Get the what?
- There's a pie in the hood. Go!

46
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:50,891
What are you doing?

47
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,031
I'm sorry.
My pie was in your hood.

48
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,337
I have to get the coffee
out of that guy's pants...

49
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,072
...and I'll be back
in the hospital by 7.

50
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,412
Damn it, Ross!
Get your butt out of the bathroom!

51
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,779
Calm down. I'm blow-drying.

52
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,322
Blow-drying what?
You have no hair.

53
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:20,793
What's going on?

54
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,494
Your boyfriend has been
in there for an hour!

55
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,527
It's like I'm living with him again.

56
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:29,632
He's here when I go to sleep and
wake up and when I want to shower.

57
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,631
I feel like I'm 16 again.

58
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:34,737
Well, you're not 16.
You're both adults now.

59
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:36,908
Get out, you doofus!

60
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,738
Or, you know,
he's rubber and you're glue.

61
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,652
All yours.

62
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,283
I hope you cleaned your hair
out of the drain.

63
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,555
Shut up!

64
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,453
Cut it out!

65
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,097
I've never wanted you more.

66
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,108
- Lui. Where is Howard?
- He went home.

67
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,512
He said he might stop by after a shift.

68
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,114
He said he tell you
he don't feel so good.

69
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,085
Hey what time do you get off?

70
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,488
I'm not feel too good either.

71
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,995
So what do you say, boys?
Should I call him?

72
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,004
You know what they say:

73
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,469
Ask your slippers a question...

74
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,540
...you're going crazy.

75
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,031
I'm sorry I didn't make it
over there today.

76
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,262
That's okay.

77
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,229
You had a thing.

78
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,731
I hear the place looks great.

79
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,542
Forget about it.
I'm having a ball!

80
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,370
How's the apartment?

81
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,076
It's terrific.
I mean, it's a regular space...

82
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:58,675
...- fest!

83
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,587
Well, great.

84
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:03,787
Yeah, I just...

85
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,622
...wanted to call and say hey.

86
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,259
Well, okay.

87
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,128
Was that the oven timer?

88
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,196
That's right, my friend.

89
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,333
It's time for...

90
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:17,500
...Baywatch!

91
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,106
Can you believe they gave
Stephanie skin cancer?

92
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,808
I can't believe
they made her lieutenant!

93
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,210
You're saying that because
you love Yasmine Bleeth.

94
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,318
How could anyone
not love Yasmine Bleeth?

95
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,717
Hey, they're running.

96
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,956
See, this is the
brilliance of the show.

97
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,056
I say always keep them running.

98
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,429
All the time running!

99
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,190
Run!

100
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,437
Run!

101
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,299
Run, Yasmine! Run like the wind!

102
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,275
But you wanted to live by yourself.

103
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:01,035
I did. I thought it'd be great.

104
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,511
I figured I'd have time alone
with my thoughts.

105
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:08,242
But it turns out I don't have
as many thoughts as you think.

106
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,690
Why don't you talk to Chandler
about moving back?

107
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,859
You really think he'd take me?

108
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,027
We had a good talk last night...

109
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,490
...but when I moved out,
I hurt him bad.

110
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,290
He would definitely want you back.

111
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:25,594
I'm telling you,
there's no way he's moving back.

112
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,330
But we had one of the greatest talks
we ever had last night.

113
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,236
I mean, it was

114
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,412
It was like when we first
started living together.

115
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,645
I know you don't want
to hear this right now...

116
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:41,818
...but we've seen him
in his new place. And he's happy.

117
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,513
He's decorated.

118
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:49,984
Chandler, he has moved on, okay?
You have to, too.

119
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,960
You'll have to accept the fact
that you're just friends now.

120
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,598
You're not...

121
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,337
...roommates anymore.

122
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,540
Okay, Phoebe.
You ready to try one?

123
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:08,369
Smelly cat, smelly cat

124
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,310
What are they feeding you?

125
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,012
Smelly, smelly, smelly
Really bad smelling smelly cat

126
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:16,346
Whoa! Oh, my God!

127
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,655
I mean, like, who was that?

128
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,726
They're your backup singers.
Behind you, hon.

129
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,699
I thought they were just watching me.

130
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,235
Like at an aquarium, you know?

131
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,435
You are so good, hi, you are so good.

132
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,408
All right.

133
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:43,643
Now everyone knows everyone.
Let's try it again.

134
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,081
From the top.

135
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,548
Smelly cat, smelly cat

136
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,723
What are they feeding you?

137
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:57,961
Okay, sorry.

138
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,796
I'm just not getting...

139
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,032
...that everyone gets...

140
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:05,737
...how smelly
this cat actually is.

141
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,833
Maybe if we could talk about this...

142
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,576
...because I need to feel
that you really care about the cat.

143
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,009
We can talk.

144
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,114
It's just that this costs
$100 a minute to be in here.

145
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,182
So the cat stinks,
but you love it. Let's go.

146
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,622
No, there is no way
he was a velociraptor.

147
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,689
Look at the cranial ridge, okay?

148
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,259
If Dino was a velociraptor,
he'd have eaten the Flintstones.

149
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:36,627
Were you taking a nap?

150
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:37,801
I was.

151
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,636
Tony, can you hold on?
That's the other line.

152
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:46,010
Yeah, she's here,
but can she call you back?

153
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,744
Okay, thanks.

154
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,036
Call Joanna.

155
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,315
Did she leave a number?

156
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,846
Did you see me write one down?

157
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,345
I don't have her number, butt-munch.

158
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,685
She'll call back.
Don't be such a baby.

159
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,223
You're the baby.

160
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,722
- Get off my back.
- Get out of my face.

161
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,659
Wait, hold on, Tony. Hold on.

162
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,997
Yeah, she's right here.
Hold on.

163
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,507
Tony, can I call you back?

164
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,176
That's my sister's boyfriend.

165
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,045
Give me that.

166
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:28,084
Sweetie, before I forget, did I
leave my diaphragm at your place?

167
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:30,885
Hi, Mom.

168
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,347
So how's the palace?

169
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,782
It's funny you should mention that
because I was thinking...

170
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:02,115
What's with the boxes?

171
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,456
Actually, I have some news.

172
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:10,455
Is that Joey guy gonna pick up
his moose hat or should I toss it?

173
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,432
Why don't you ask him yourself?
This is my new roommate, Eddie.

174
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:16,725
Nice to meet you.

175
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,765
- Likewise.
- How you doing?

176
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,100
I'll take that.

177
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,601
It's what I came for.

178
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,438
This is new.
Where'd you two meet?

179
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,274
At the supermarket
in the ethnic food section.

180
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,414
I helped him pick out a chorizo.

181
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:40,181
We got to talking. He needed
a place, and I had a spare room.

182
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:42,821
Now it's a spare room?

183
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,925
Well, yeah.
In that it's not being used...

184
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,028
...and I have it to spare.

185
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,799
Well, I got what I came for.

186
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:57,774
I'll see you.

187
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:00,734
Hey, Joe.

188
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,914
When'd you start using
moose in your hair?

189
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,376
Is this guy great, or what?

190
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,253
Yeah, he is.

191
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,895
I can't believe he has
a new roommate. Who is he?

192
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,828
Eddie. He just met him.

193
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,503
It'll never last.
He's just a rebound roommate.

194
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,400
Check it out! Check it out!

195
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,611
It's "Smelly Cat," the video!

196
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:41,512
Now, I haven't seen it yet,
so if you don't like it...

197
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,222
...so what?
None of you ever made a video.

198
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:56,424
Get out of here, cat! You stink!

199
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,399
Smoking!

200
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,610
Look at me!

201
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,403
Smelly cat, smelly cat

202
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,113
What are they feeding you?

203
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:17,010
Smelly cat, smelly cat

204
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,951
It's not your fault

205
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,497
Smelly, smelly, smelly
Really bad smelling smelly cat

206
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,426
It's not your fault

207
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,466
Smelly cat, smelly cat

208
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,797
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

209
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,040
I sound amazing!

210
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,777
They won't take you to the vet

211
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,311
You're obviously not their favorite pet

212
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,950
Smelly cat, smelly cat

213
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,084
It's not your fault

214
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,755
I've never heard myself sing before.

215
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,224
I mean, except in my own head.

216
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,591
This is so cool!
Now I can hear what you hear!

217
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,502
Pretty different, huh?

218
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,500
I am sorry,
but I'm incredibly talented!

219
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,004
Smelly cat, smelly cat

220
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,543
It's not your fault

221
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,819
What's going on, man?

222
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,856
Eddie.

223
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,057
Morning.

224
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:35,124
I just came by to pick up my mail.

225
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,763
- Where's the mail?
- Over there on the table.

226
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,529
You don't keep it
on this table anymore?

227
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,364
Eddie likes it over there.

228
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:51,175
All right, here you go, my friend.
Eggs a la Eddie.

229
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,049
That's great.

230
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,393
What?

231
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,491
I thought you liked your eggs...

232
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:06,993
...with the bread with the hole
in the middle, a la me!

233
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,197
I do, but Eddie makes them this way.
They're pretty darn good.

234
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,601
Will you try some,
there are some extra.

235
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:13,905
- No, thanks!
- All right.

236
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,664
Well, you guys...

237
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,099
...I'm out of here.

238
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:19,742
See you, pals.

239
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:20,911
See you.

240
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,510
- How are you two getting along?
- I couldn't be happier.

241
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,220
Great.

242
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,213
I'm happy for you.

243
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,816
All right, that's it!

244
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:40,892
He just comes in here,
Mr. Johnny New Eggs...

245
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:47,095
...with his moving the mail
and his "See you, pals."

246
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,135
And now there's no juice!

247
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:55,072
There's no juice for the people
who need the juice. I need the juice!

248
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,578
There's another carton there.

249
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,283
This isn't about juice anymore,
all right, man?

250
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:04,652
All right.

251
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:05,924
So what's it about?

252
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,087
Eggs!

253
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,022
Whose eggs do you like better,
his or mine?

254
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,890
- Well, I like both eggs equally.
- Oh, come on!

255
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,833
Nobody likes two eggs equally.
I wanna know which one you like better.

256
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,629
What's the difference?
Your eggs aren't here anymore.

257
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,705
You took your eggs and you left!

258
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,738
Did you expect me
to never find new eggs?

259
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,717
Maybe this is not about the eggs.

260
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,620
Maybe it's about the
chicken that lay them.

261
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,725
What chicken, there is no chicken.

262
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,250
I can't talk to you.

263
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,994
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.

264
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,827
Tough. We're watching
Predators of the Serengeti.

265
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,332
Would you guys stop!

266
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,439
It's my TV!

267
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,005
- Quit it!
- Bite me!

268
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,973
Monica keeps changing the channel.

269
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,910
That's great.
Why don't you tell Mommy on me?

270
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,184
Now I'm Mommy in this little play?

271
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,479
Look, I refuse to get sucked into...

272
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:14,954
...this weird little Geller
dimension thing, okay?

273
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:18,129
So I'm gonna go take
a nice long hot bubble bath...

274
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:21,298
...because you kids
are driving me crazy!

275
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,693
What do we do about this?

276
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,872
We could tape Entertainment Tonight.

277
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,039
Not that!

278
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,070
This! Us!

279
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,810
Oh, my God, Ross, it's...
You're just...

280
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,639
Since you've been here,
you're driving me...

281
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,874
Mon, you've gone ultrasonic
again, all right?

282
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,511
I just can't stand you being here...

283
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:44,779
...all the time!

284
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,220
Why? Why can't you
stand me being here?

285
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:49,654
We're just having fun.

286
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,523
Fun? You think this is fun?

287
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:57,391
I thought we were fooling around,
like when we were kids.

288
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,433
I hated you when we were kids!

289
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,398
You hated me when we were kids?

290
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,908
I hated you.

291
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,578
I loved you in a you're-my-
brother-so-I-have-to way...

292
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,747
...but basically, I hated your guts.

293
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,476
Why did you hate me?

294
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,653
Because you were mean to me...

295
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:19,221
...and you teased me
and you always got your way.

296
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,583
That wasn't fun for you?

297
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,865
I can't believe you hated me.

298
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,599
But now I love you.

299
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,607
And not just because I have to.

300
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,276
Really?

301
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,576
You're just gonna have
to stop pissing me off.

302
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,444
I can do that.

303
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,381
Then I won't have to kill you.

304
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:59,052
So you wanna watch
Entertainment Tonight?

305
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:00,356
Thanks.

306
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,128
You know what?

307
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:10,330
If you really wanna watch
that Serengeti thing, we can.

308
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,552
Listen, you are not
going to believe this...

309
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,219
...but that is not me
singing on the video.

310
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,129
How did you find out?

311
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:36,800
The record company sent this paper
for me to sign saying it's okay...

312
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:40,596
...for someone else to sing for me.
That was my first clue.

313
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,764
What will you do?

314
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,441
I can't work with people
who would do this.

315
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:46,835
Sure.

316
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,478
I mean, this poor woman.

317
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:50,644
What woman?

318
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,110
The voice woman.

319
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:55,182
She has a great voice,
but she doesn't have a video.

320
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,114
Okay, Pheebs, but what about you?

321
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,291
I have a video. Pay attention.

322
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:06,823
This voice woman, she's so talented.

323
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:12,002
But according to the producer people,
she doesn't have the right look.

324
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,033
She's like one of those
animals at the pound...

325
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,708
...who nobody wants
because they're not pretty.

326
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:22,344
Or you know, like some old dog
who's kind of like stinky and

327
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,548
Oh, my God! She's "smelly cat"!

328
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:30,020
That song has so many levels.

329
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:33,722
Hey, Eddie.

330
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,023
You wanna play some foosball?

331
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,855
No, thanks, man.
I'm not really into sports.

332
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,332
Yeah, okay. All right.

333
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:51,073
Doesn't matter.
Time for Baywatch!

334
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,240
You like that show?

335
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:57,937
You don't?

336
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:03,044
It's just pretty people
running around on the beach.

337
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:05,846
That's the brilliance of it.

338
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:10,022
The pretty people.

339
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,920
And the running.

340
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,767
I'm gonna go read in my room
for a little while.

341
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,469
Okay, man.

342
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:34,850
I think of all the friends I've known

343
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:40,450
But when I dial the telephone

344
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,689
No one's home

345
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:58,742
All by myself

346
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,904
Don't wanna live

347
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,276
All by myself

348
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,253
Anymore

349
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:14,415
All by myself

350
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:21,455
I'm gonna sort off with a
little song called smelly cat.

351
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:26,437
For those of you who wondering
this is my real voice.

352
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:30,902
Smelly cat, smelly cat

353
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:34,042
What are they feeding you?
Everybody!

354
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:37,077
Smelly cat, smelly cat

355
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,509
It's not your fault

356
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,553
They won't take you to the vet

357
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,417
You're obviously not
their favorite pet

358
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,990
You may not be a bed of roses

359
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,732
And you're no friend
To those with noses

360
00:23:57,402 --> 00:24:00,860
Ross, those are the only lines we have.
Back to the chorus!
