1
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,306
So how was Joan?

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:08,470
Broke up with her.

3
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,073
Oh, why?

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,006
Don't tell me.
Because of the big nostril thing?

5
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,977
They were huge!

6
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:19,148
When she sneezed,
bats flew out of them.

7
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:21,950
They were not that huge.

8
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:25,486
I'm telling you, she leaned back,
I could see her brain.

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,855
How many women will you reject...

10
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,359
...over superficial,
insignificant things

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,360
Hold it. I gotta side
with Chandler on this one.

12
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,158
When I first moved here,
I went out with this girl.

13
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,837
Really hot. Great kisser...

14
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:43,199
...but she had the biggest
Adam's apple.

15
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:45,403
Drove me nuts.

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,640
- You or me?
- I got it.

17
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,443
Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,324
You guys are messing with me, right?

19
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,130
Yeah. We are!

20
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:10,896
That's a good one.
For a second there, I was like, whoa!

21
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:16,199
The One Where Heckles Dies

22
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:02,983
You name one woman that you broke up
with for an actual real reason.

23
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,154
Maureen Rasillo.

24
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:09,054
Because she doesn't hate Yanni
is not a real reason.

25
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,124
Hello, Mr. Heckles.

26
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,360
You're doing it again.

27
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,062
We're not doing anything.

28
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,203
You're stomping.
It's disturbing my birds.

29
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,635
You don't have birds.

30
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,078
I could have birds.

31
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,914
We'll try to keep it down.

32
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,446
Thank you.

33
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,188
I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.

34
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,887
All right, bye-bye.

35
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,427
Okay, Janice.

36
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,561
Give me Janice.
That wasn't about being picky.

37
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:45,923
We'll give you Janice.

38
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,963
I miss Janice, though.

39
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,292
Hello, Chandler Bing!

40
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,200
Oh, my God!

41
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,033
Oh, Chandler!

42
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,369
Now! Now!

43
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:03,911
That's it.

44
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,251
There! Faster!

45
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:18,056
Stop with the broom!
We're not making noise!

46
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,300
We won.

47
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,009
We did it!

48
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:35,812
Mr. Heckles!

49
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,485
- How did this happen?
- He was sweeping.

50
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,950
They found a broom in his hand.

51
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,754
- That's terrible.
- I know.

52
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,163
I was sweeping yesterday.

53
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,194
It could've been me.

54
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:57,932
Sweeping. You never know.

55
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,330
Never know.

56
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:07,779
It's very faint, but I can
still sense him in the building.

57
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,244
Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!

58
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,086
Okay, Phoebe.

59
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,982
I'm sorry,
but sometimes they need help.

60
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,325
Here we go.

61
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,996
That's fine, go ahead and scoff.

62
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,732
There are a lot of things
I don't believe in...

63
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,059
...but that doesn't mean
they're not true.

64
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,530
Such as?

65
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:36,364
Like crop circles or
the Bermuda Triangle or evolution.

66
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,541
What, you don't believe in evolution?

67
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,008
Not really.

68
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,176
You don't believe in evolution?

69
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,781
I don't know.
It's just, you know...

70
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:55,790
Monkeys, Darwin, it's a nice story.
I just think it's a little too easy.

71
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,996
"Too easy"? Too

72
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,669
The process of every living thing
on this planet evolving...

73
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:10,205
...over millions of years from
single-celled organisms is "too easy"?

74
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,012
Yeah, I just don't buy it.

75
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:18,076
Excuse me. Evolution is not
for you to buy, Phoebe.

76
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:22,150
Evolution is scientific fact,
like the air we breathe...

77
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,912
...like gravity.

78
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,420
Don't get me started on gravity.

79
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,425
You don't believe in gravity?

80
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:38,894
Well, it's not so much that,
you know, I don't believe in it.

81
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,037
Lately I get the feeling that...

82
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:44,437
...I'm not so much being pulled
down as I am being pushed.

83
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,768
Pushed.

84
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,411
It's Isaac Newton and he's pissed.

85
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,553
There she is. And over there,
that's the other one.

86
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,953
This is Mr. Buddy Doyle,
Heckles' attorney.

87
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,250
He'd like to talk to you.

88
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:04,923
What can we do for you?

89
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,223
All right, kids, here's the deal.

90
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,491
According my client's will...

91
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:14,264
...he wants to leave
all his earthly possessions...

92
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,271
...to "the noisy girls
in the apartment above mine."

93
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:20,938
What about his family?

94
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,647
He didn't have any.

95
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,812
Okay, so let's talk money.

96
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:29,951
All right, there was none.

97
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,815
Now, let's talk signing.

98
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,253
You be noisy girl number one.
You be noisy girl number two.

99
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,956
I can't believe that this whole time
we thought he hated us.

100
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:43,735
Isn't it amazing how much
you can touch someone's life...

101
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,970
...without even knowing it?

102
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,706
Would you look at this dump?

103
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,204
He hated us!
This was his final revenge!

104
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,705
I've never seen so much crap!

105
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:56,537
Actually, I think this apartment
sullies the good name of crap.

106
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,142
Check this out.

107
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,644
Can I have this?

108
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,820
How can you not believe in evolution?

109
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,795
I don't know, just don't.
Look at this funky shirt!

110
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,497
Pheebs, I've studied evolution
my entire adult life.

111
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:18,066
And we've collected fossils
from all over the world...

112
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:21,771
...that actually show the evolution
of different species.

113
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,770
I mean, you can literally see them...

114
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:28,571
...evolving through time.

115
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,683
Really? You can actually see it?

116
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:36,513
You bet! In the U.S.,
China, Africa, all over!

117
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,155
See, I didn't know that.

118
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,851
Well, there you go.

119
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:48,599
So now the real question is,
who put those fossils there and why?

120
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:56,074
Look at this!
My Big Book of Grievances.

121
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,245
Hey, there's me!

122
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,810
"April 17th, excessive noise...

123
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,917
...Italian guy comes home with a date."

124
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,049
You're in here too.

125
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,921
"April 18th, excessive noise...

126
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,854
...Italian guy's gay roommate
brings home dry cleaning."

127
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,632
Well, that's excellent.

128
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,303
Look at this lamp.

129
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,940
Is this tacky or what?
We have to have this.

130
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,304
I think we have enough regular lamps.

131
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,672
What? Come on, it's not like...

132
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:38,576
...I'm asking for this
girlie clock or anything.

133
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,718
Which, by the way,
I also think is really cool.

134
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,954
Look, it doesn't go
with any of my stuff.

135
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,886
Well, what about my stuff?

136
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,153
You don't have any stuff.

137
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,963
You still think of it
as your apartment, don't you?

138
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,061
Yes, you do.

139
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,637
You think of it as your apartment
and I just rent a room.

140
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:09,571
While you "mmm" on that,
I'll go find a place for my new lamp.

141
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:16,480
Okay, Pheebs. See how I'm making
these little toys move?

142
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,714
Opposable thumbs!

143
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:27,199
Without evolution, how do you
explain opposable thumbs?

144
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,102
Maybe the Overlords needed them
to steer their spacecrafts.

145
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,496
Tell me you're joking.

146
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:38,942
Look, can't we say that you believe
in something and I don't?

147
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,907
No, Pheebs, we can't.

148
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,059
No, what's that all about?

149
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,423
What is this obsessive need
to make everybody agree with you?

150
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:04,927
I think maybe it's time
you put Ross under the microscope.

151
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,033
Is there blood coming out of my ears?

152
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,274
Check it out.
Heckles' high-school yearbook.

153
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,413
He looks so normal!

154
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,654
He's even kind of cute.

155
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,152
"Heckles, you crack me up
in science class.

156
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,425
You're the funniest kid in school."

157
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,957
- Funniest? Heckles?
- That's what it says.

158
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:34,460
Heckles was voted class clown,
and so was I.

159
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,664
He was right!
Would you listen to that?

160
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,202
I'd call that excessive.

161
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:42,970
What?

162
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,142
Heckles played clarinet in band,
and I played clarinet.

163
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,905
He was in the scale
modeler's club and I was

164
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:53,208
There was no club,
but I sure thought they were cool.

165
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,950
So? You were both dorks.

166
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:57,383
Big deal.

167
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,892
I just think it's weird, you know?
Heckles and me

168
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,155
Heckles and me. Me

169
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:04,685
Me and Heckles.

170
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,391
Hey, would you knock it off!

171
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,814
Have you been here all night?

172
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:30,850
Look at this.

173
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,389
Pictures of all the women
Heckles went out with.

174
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:37,323
Look what he wrote on them.
"Vivian, too tall."

175
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,188
"Madge, big gums."

176
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,455
"Too loud."

177
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,860
"Too smart."
"Makes noise when she eats."

178
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,695
This is me.

179
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,802
This is what I do.

180
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,908
I'm gonna end up alone,
just like he did.

181
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,770
Heckles was a nut case.

182
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,945
Our trains are on the same track.

183
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:59,615
I'm coming up 30 years behind him,
but the stops are all the same.

184
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,510
Bitter Town...

185
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:04,514
...Alone-ville, Hermit Junction!

186
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,423
You know what we gotta do?
Get you out of here.

187
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,355
I'll buy you breakfast.

188
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,427
What if I never find somebody?
Or worse, what if I found her...

189
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,601
...but I dumped her because
she pronounces it, "supposably"?

190
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:21,306
Chandler, come on,
you're gonna find somebody.

191
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,438
How do you know that? How?

192
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,338
I don't know. I'm just
trying to help you out.

193
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,311
You guys will all get married...

194
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:30,980
...and I'll end up alone.

195
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,409
Will you promise me something?

196
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,951
When you're married, will you
invite me over for holidays?

197
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,117
I don't know what we'll be doing.

198
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,324
I mean, what if we're over
at her folks' place?

199
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,692
Yeah, I understand.

200
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,338
You can come over
and watch the Super Bowl.

201
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,474
Every year, all right?

202
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:02,043
You know what?
I'm not gonna end up like this.

203
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,111
I'll see you, man.

204
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,125
"Supposably."

205
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,296
Supposably!

206
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,196
Did they go to the zoo?

207
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,631
Supposably.

208
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,483
Hi. It's me.

209
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:46,019
Oh, my God!

210
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,520
Janice? You called Janice?

211
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,355
Yes. Janice.

212
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,530
Why is that difficult to comprehend?

213
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,028
You remember Janice, right?

214
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:02,731
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty
and she honestly cared about me.

215
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,670
Janice is my last chance
to have somebody.

216
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,742
Oh, my God!

217
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,548
Jeez, look how fat she got.

218
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:24,255
- Hey, it's everybody!
- Hi, Janice.

219
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,689
Janice, you're...

220
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,956
Yes, I am.

221
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,632
- Is it?
- Is it yours?

222
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,894
You wish, Chandler Bing!

223
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,541
You are looking at a married lady now.

224
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,045
Congratulations.

225
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,444
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

226
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,619
You couldn't tell me on the phone?

227
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,859
And what? Miss the expression
on your face? Oh, no!

228
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,858
Janice likes to have her fun!

229
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:11,800
You know what we haven't
played in a while?

230
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,437
Hide the lamp.

231
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,143
Monica, let it go.

232
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,315
Did you know
I'm allergic to shellfish?

233
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,613
Then you'll just have
to eat the other lamps.

234
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,387
It's scary scientist man.

235
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,793
Okay, Phoebe, this is it.

236
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,764
In this briefcase I carry
actual scientific facts.

237
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,700
A briefcase of facts, if you will.

238
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:48,937
Some of these fossils are
over 200 million years old.

239
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:52,342
Before you even start,
I'm not denying evolution.

240
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,676
It's just one of the possibilities.

241
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,854
It's the only possibility.

242
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,489
Ross, could you just open
your mind, like, this much?

243
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:06,458
Didn't the brightest minds in
the world believe the Earth was flat?

244
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,995
And up till 50 years ago, you thought
the atom was the smallest thing...

245
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,968
...until you split it open
and this whole mess of crap came out.

246
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:22,474
Are you telling me that you are
so unbelievably arrogant...

247
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:26,512
...that you can't admit that
there's a teeny, tiny possibility...

248
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,720
...that you could be wrong about this?

249
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,461
There might be...

250
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,561
...a teeny...

251
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,091
...tiny...

252
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,395
...possibility.

253
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,368
I can't believe you caved.

254
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:56,611
You just abandoned
your whole belief system!

255
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,248
Before, I didn't agree with you,
but at least I respected you.

256
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,914
But...

257
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,583
How are you gonna go
into work tomorrow?

258
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,554
How are you going to face
the other science guys?

259
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,592
How are you going to face yourself?

260
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,238
That was fun.
So who's hungry?

261
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,346
I am.

262
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,744
Me too.
Let me just get my coat.

263
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,756
What happened?

264
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,563
It was an accident, I swear.

265
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:50,768
I was putting on my jacket and
the thing and the lamp and it broke.

266
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:54,403
Oh, please, Monica!
You've always hated my lamp!

267
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:58,837
And now all of a sudden,
it's just magically, it's just broken?

268
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,304
Phoebe, tell her?

269
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,843
I didn't see it, because
I was putting on my jacket.

270
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,380
But I want to believe you.

271
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:13,757
Hey, Chandler. Monica just
broke my seashell lamp.

272
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,452
Neat.

273
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,559
I'm gonna die alone!

274
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:20,828
Okay, you win.

275
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,265
Chandler, you are not
gonna die alone.

276
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,769
Janice was my safety net, okay?

277
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,632
And now I have to get a snake.

278
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:32,806
Why is that?

279
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:36,445
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man,
I'm gonna need a thing.

280
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,273
You know, a hook.

281
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:41,509
Like that guy on the subway
who eats his own face.

282
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,246
So I figure I'll be
"Crazy Man With A Snake."

283
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:45,751
Crazy Snake Man.

284
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,992
Then I'll get more snakes,
call them my babies.

285
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,352
Kids will run past my place!

286
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,790
"Run away from Crazy Snake Man,"
they'll shout!

287
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,870
You've got to get over this.

288
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:01,703
You won't end up alone.

289
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,497
Of course I will.

290
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:07,506
I reject anyone who's crazy enough
to actually go out with me...

291
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:11,375
...and then I bitch that there
aren't any great women out there.

292
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,314
You have just described...

293
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:19,149
...virtually every man
that we've ever gone out with.

294
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,219
You are not a freak.
You're a guy.

295
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,158
She's right.

296
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,052
You're no different than the rest.

297
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,487
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Yes, he is.

298
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,492
You are totally different.

299
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:00,730
In a bad way?

300
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,761
No, honey, in a wonderful way.

301
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,762
You know what you want now.

302
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,537
Most guys don't even have a clue.

303
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:10,569
You're ready to take risks, be
vulnerable and intimate with someone.

304
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,376
You're not gonna end up alone.

305
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,707
You called Janice. That's how much
you wanted to be with someone!

306
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,417
- You've made it!
- You're there!

307
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,054
You are ready to make a commitment!

308
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,519
Don't know about that!

309
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,025
What you got there?

310
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:39,395
Something else that's not yours
that you can break?

311
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,309
I know you like this
and I want you to have it.

312
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,545
It'll look good in our apartment.

313
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,543
Thank you.

314
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,213
That's fine.

315
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,251
You'll all be pleased to know
that I have a date tomorrow night.

316
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,860
This woman Allison from work.
She is great.

317
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,293
She's pretty, she's smart.
And I've been...

318
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,833
...holding off asking her out
in the past, because she has a...

319
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,474
...unusually large head.

320
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:21,137
But I'm not going to let
that stuff hang me up anymore.

321
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,178
Look at me. I'm growing.

322
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,577
You can't recycle yearbooks, can you?

323
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:29,579
I'll take that.

324
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:30,946
You want his yearbook?

325
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:35,551
Some people said nice things about him.
Somebody should have it.

326
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,261
Gosh, this is so weird.

327
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,827
His whole life was in
this apartment and now it's gone.

328
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:47,434
I think it would be nice if we just
took a few moments for Mr. Heckles.

329
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:52,373
He was kind of a pain.
He was, but he was a person.

330
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,809
You're all going to hell.

331
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,246
It's really not that big!

332
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,686
- Taking that with you, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

333
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:16,496
You coming?

334
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,226
In a second.

335
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,387
Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.

336
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,851
We'll try to keep it down.

337
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,661
My major was useless.

338
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:57,966
How often do you look in the classifieds
and see "Philosopher Wanted"?

339
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,676
Sure.

340
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,106
My God, that's a big head!

341
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:07,813
It didn't look this big in the office.
Maybe it's the lighting.

342
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:11,249
My head must look
like a golf ball at work.

343
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:16,087
Don't get hung up on it. Quick!
List five things you like about her.

344
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,361
Nice smile, good dresser.

345
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,065
Big head, big head, big head!
