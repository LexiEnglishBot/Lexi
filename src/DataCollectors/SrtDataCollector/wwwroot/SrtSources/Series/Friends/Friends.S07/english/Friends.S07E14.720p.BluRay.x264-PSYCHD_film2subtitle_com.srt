1
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:07,297
Happy birthday!

2
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,632
Happy birthday!

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,345
- Rach, come on.
- Come on.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:14,972
It's your birthday.

5
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:16,849
Hey.

6
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,645
She's not as pretty as she was
when she was 29.

7
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:27,443
Ms. Green wants to establish
some ground rules before she comes out.

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,988
She would appreciate it if you didn't
use the words "old" or "downhill"...

9
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,741
...or "They still look pretty damn good."

10
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,038
They do.

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,124
Rachel, come on out.

12
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,251
Monica made breakfast.

13
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,878
Chocolate chip pancakes.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,297
We've got presents.

15
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,259
Good ones?

16
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,680
They all came from the list
you handed out to us two weeks ago.

17
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,768
Well, can I keep the presents
and still be 29?

18
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:05,022
Come on, Rach, look,
turning 30 is not that big a deal.

19
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,025
Oh, really? Is that how you felt
when you turned 30?

20
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,194
Why, God, why?

21
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:15,199
We had a deal.
Let the others grow old, not me.

22
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,662
Oh, come on, you guys, is it just me?
Am I overreacting?

23
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:25,542
No, Rach, it is not just you. My 30th
birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.

24
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,836
And now Chandler.

25
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,715
We're all getting so old.

26
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,510
Why are you doing this to us?

27
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,099
Rach, you're in a great place in your life.
You have an amazing job, good friends.

28
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,476
Your roommate's a soap opera star.

29
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,562
Your character is in a coma.

30
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,775
I promised myself
I wasn't gonna cry at this one.

31
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,905
I know my life's going pretty well,
but I see so many people...

32
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,576
...who've accomplished so many
of their goals by the time they're 30.

33
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,579
Yeah, but you shouldn't
compare yourself to me.

34
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,999
- Come on, Phoebe.
- You can do it.

35
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,459
Come on. There you go.

36
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,678
I did it.
One mile on a Hippity Hop.

37
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,015
That's it. That's everything I wanted to do
before I was 30.

38
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,101
Oh, except I wanted to
patch things up with my sister.

39
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,519
Oh, well. But, yay!

40
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,192
And, girls, this thing is a godsend,
if you know what I mean. Heh.

41
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,121
Come on, let's have some fun, huh?
What do you want to do today?

42
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,165
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.

43
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:33,337
Doing nothing on your 30th is better
than doing something stupid, like Ross.

44
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,423
Hey, that was a practical purchase.

45
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,635
I needed that car for transportation.

46
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,012
Okay? I have a child.

47
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,641
How hot do I look in this, huh?

48
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,018
Ross, a sports car?

49
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,563
Wouldn't it be cheaper
to just stuff a sock down there?

50
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,483
That's not what this is about, okay?

51
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,985
I am a sports car enthusiast.

52
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,948
- I've always been into cars.
- What's the horsepower on this thing?

53
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,742
I don't know, but look how shiny.

54
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:09,915
- I can't believe you bought this.
- So can I have a ride, stud?

55
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,583
Hop in.

56
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,339
Get ready for the smoothest ride
of your life.

57
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,239
Damn it.

58
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,993
Okay, who's next?

59
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,206
You know what?
I am gonna do something today.

60
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,375
I'm not just gonna sit around
like some old lady.

61
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,961
I want to get something pierced.

62
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,506
Like my, uh, nose
or my tongue or something.

63
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,425
Really? Because, you know, that hurts.

64
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,468
So what? You know, the way I see it...

65
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,804
Ow! Son of a bitch.

66
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,766
Look, Rachel,
I know what you're going through.

67
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,228
I'm totally freaked out about turning 25.

68
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,567
Get out of my apartment.

69
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,070
Rach, for what it's worth,
I think that you're doing great.

70
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,115
I mean, let's face it,
no one handles this well.

71
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,242
Heh. Least of all you.

72
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,542
Would you put that back on.
Monica's gonna be here any minute.

73
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,919
But it hurts my Joey's apple.

74
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:45,177
Okay, for the last time,
it's not named after each individual man.

75
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,350
You've done a wonderful job
with this party, Chandler.

76
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,644
- Everything looks so lovely.
- Oh, well, not as lovely as you.

77
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:58,357
I mean, I can't believe
you would have a 30-year-old daughter.

78
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:02,402
And you, I can't believe
you would have a tux that's 30 years old.

79
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,783
It's older than that. Ross was actually
conceived right near this tuxedo.

80
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,451
Oh.

81
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,913
Okay, everybody hide.
I saw her. She's coming.

82
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,665
Okay, okay. Everybody down.
Everybody down.

83
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,966
Okay, everybody stay here.
I will find out what's going on.

84
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:30,305
Hey, you got the door open.

85
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,809
Hey, are you drunk?

86
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,227
No.

87
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,730
Okay.

88
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,607
Whoa.

89
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,361
Okay.

90
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,074
See, I was a little nervous
about turning...

91
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,367
...30.

92
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,704
So the busboys
took me out for some drinks.

93
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,544
Might want to puke on you later.

94
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:07,008
Okay, here's the thing. We have thrown
a very formal surprise party for you.

95
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,469
All your friends are in there
and your parents.

96
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,847
- No.
- Yes.

97
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,850
Oh, no. My parents have never
seen me drunk.

98
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,560
That they know of.

99
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,731
Here's the thing. We'll get you some coffee
and they will never know that you're drunk.

100
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,443
- Really, you promise?
- Yeah, I'll take care of it.

101
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,695
I love you so much.

102
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:30,991
Okay, we have to do something
about your breath.

103
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,286
What about your breath?

104
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,372
That's still yours.

105
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,002
Okay, now, remember,
it's a surprise party.

106
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,546
So when you go in, act surprised.

107
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,839
- Okay.
- Okay. Shh.

108
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,132
Ready?

109
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,724
Surprise!

110
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,607
Okay, forward. Forward.

111
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,983
Stop!

112
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,111
Okay, back... Stop!

113
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:13,241
Okay, for... Stop! Stop! Stop!

114
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,661
Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

115
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,664
I'm gonna break into this minivan,
put it in neutral.

116
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,709
You guys push it forward
so Ross can drive out of the spot.

117
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,795
Okay? All right. Here we go.

118
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,303
Haul ass!

119
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,109
Happy 30th birthday. Here.

120
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,571
It's for the child in you.
And the woman.

121
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,532
Happy 30th.

122
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,534
Why do you keep saying that?

123
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,203
Because it's our 30th birthday.

124
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:01,790
Yeah, no, we're not 30.
We're 31. Okay.

125
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,000
Wait.

126
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,629
Oh, it's you.

127
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,548
Yeah. What?

128
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,800
Yeah, we're not 30. We're 31.

129
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,301
Nuh-uh.

130
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,971
Yuh-huh. That's what it says
on my birth certificate.

131
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,764
You have your birth certificate?

132
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,892
Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff
when my mom died.

133
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,477
Our mom.

134
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,146
Right. Okay.

135
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:30,068
- Do you have my birth certificate?
- No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.

136
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,239
Oh, my God.

137
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,284
Oh, my God, we are 31.

138
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,035
Yeah.

139
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,872
I just lost a whole year of my life.

140
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,374
Okay.

141
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,378
- Your middle name is Pamela?
- Yes.

142
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,631
Oh, I never knew mine.
Do you remember what it is?

143
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,009
Yes. Phoebe.

144
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:59,014
- That's my first name.
- Right. Okay. Then, no.

145
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,645
Look at that. We made it all the way
across the room. You're doing great.

146
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,940
- What's going on?
- Monica's a little drunk.

147
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,443
Yay, I love drunk Monica.

148
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,031
Oh, she's so much more fun
than regular Monica.

149
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,369
She doesn't want her parents
to know she's drunk.

150
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,956
Oh, all right, all right.
Here's what we'll do.

151
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:29,127
I'll get twice as drunk as Monica
and then no one's even gonna notice her.

152
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,966
What's going on?

153
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,093
Monica's wasted.

154
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,888
Maybe that'll liven up this party.

155
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,974
Okay, will you just go help her
get changed, please?

156
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,645
Okay, but taking care of a drunk,
naked woman seems like a job for Joey.

157
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,896
Yep.

158
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,652
- This one's from me.
- Ah.

159
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,529
It wasn't on your list,
but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.

160
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,908
A scooter.

161
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,870
Stick to the list.

162
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,583
Always stick to the list.

163
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,711
No, no, no, I love it. Thank you.

164
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,714
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next.

165
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,425
Now that you're a couple,
we don't get two presents from you?

166
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,762
For my last birthday,
you gave me a hug.

167
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,765
- Okay, read the card, read the card.
- Okay.

168
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,896
"Happy birthday, Grandma.

169
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,901
It's better to be over the hill...

170
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,696
...than buried under it.

171
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,868
All our love,
Monica and Chandler." That's funny.

172
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,454
No, no, no, no. That was a joke.

173
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,457
I know, I get it. It's funny.

174
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,668
No, because you're not a grandmother.

175
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,422
I know, because to be a grandmother,
you have to be married and have children.

176
00:11:55,631 --> 00:12:00,135
I don't have any of those things.
That's why it's so funny.

177
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,137
I'm just gonna go...

178
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,477
All you had to do was buy the card.

179
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,402
Okay, you know what?

180
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,321
It was stupid to get upset
about not having a husband and kids.

181
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,824
All I really needed was a plan.

182
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,034
See, I wanna have three kids.

183
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,787
Let me guess. And you want to have them
all at the same time...

184
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,331
...and you want to have them
for your brother. Ha, ha.

185
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,835
As I was saying...

186
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,630
I should probably have the first
of the three kids by the time I'm 35, right?

187
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,966
Which gives me five years.

188
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:44,846
So if I wanna have a kid when I'm 35,
I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34.

189
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,767
Which gives Prada four years
to start making maternity clothes.

190
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:55,690
Oh, wait, but I do want to be married
for a year before I get pregnant.

191
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,776
Really? That long?

192
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,575
Look all you want, it's happening.

193
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,538
So I don't have to get married
until I'm 33.

194
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,707
That's three years.
That's three whole years.

195
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,083
Oh, wait a minute though.

196
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,462
I'll need a year and a half
to plan the wedding.

197
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,132
And I'd like to know the guy
for like a year, year and a half...

198
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,344
...before we get engaged.

199
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:28,723
Which means I need to meet the guy
by the time I'm 30.

200
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,062
Which is fine,
because you just turned...

201
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,064
...28.

202
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,317
No, Ross. No, it is not fine.

203
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:43,029
According to my plan, I should already
be with the guy that I'm gonna marry.

204
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,080
Will you quit hogging it?

205
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:01,172
Oh, I'm telling you, it's like
watching Bambi learn how to walk.

206
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,884
You're drunk.

207
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:09,097
Mom and Dad are gonna be mad.

208
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,183
Maybe I'm a little drunk.

209
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,187
Hey. Are those crab cakes?

210
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:20,149
Did I not tell you to come straight to me
when more crab cakes were ready?

211
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,778
How you feeling?

212
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,448
You are so handsome.

213
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,495
I want to make love to you
right here, right now.

214
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,293
I really wish that you wouldn't.

215
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,298
All you have to do is just get through
a little bit more, okay?

216
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:49,554
Then we can put you in bed, okay?
Just smile and don't talk to anyone.

217
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,516
Speech, speech.
Let's hear from the birthday girl, huh?

218
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,643
Pheebs.

219
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,812
Don't you see,
everybody's looking at me.

220
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,480
The plan's working.

221
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,651
I didn't even have to take off my top yet.

222
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,112
Speech. Come on, speech.

223
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,615
Come on. Speech.

224
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,994
Hey, Chandler, you can't keep
your hands off her for one second.

225
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,829
Oh, I think it's nice.

226
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,290
I think it's necessary.

227
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,009
I wanna thank you all for coming.

228
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,346
My family and my friends.

229
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,973
Whoo-hoo.

230
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:39,312
I'd really like to say that I'm, um...

231
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,024
You know what I'd really like to say?

232
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,860
I'm drunk.

233
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,906
That's right, Mom and Dad.

234
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,534
Your little "Harmomica" is hammered.

235
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,290
And guess what? I've been drunk before.

236
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,168
And I've smoked a cigarette.

237
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,546
But you know what? You know what?

238
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:11,678
It's all okay.
It's okay, because I turned 30 today.

239
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,222
And I can do anything I want.

240
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,934
Because I am a grownup.

241
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,693
- Okay, quick. Help me get this off.
- Yeah.

242
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,739
I lost a whole year.

243
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,575
I can't believe it. This is so unfair.

244
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,744
Come on, Pheebs, it'll be okay.

245
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,246
Will it? Will it?

246
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,250
How would you feel if you found out
you were 31?

247
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:46,254
That's not gonna happen, you know,
because we have a new deal.

248
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,716
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule.

249
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:53,928
I haven't done any of the things
I wanted to do by the time I was 31.

250
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,888
- Like what?
- Like, okay...

251
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,558
...I haven't met any Portuguese people.

252
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,269
I haven't had the perfect kiss.

253
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,771
And I haven't been to sniper school.

254
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,943
Phoebe, why don't we go upstairs
and have some birthday cake?

255
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,947
No, I just feel like being by myself for a
while, all right? I'll see you guys later.

256
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,490
Thanks.

257
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,368
Oh, poor Pheebs.

258
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:21,122
Hey, you know what, you guys?
I think I'm gonna go walk her home.

259
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,128
- Oh, man.
- What?

260
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,297
He's gonna eat the cake.

261
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,508
Pheebs. Wait up.

262
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,302
Listen, I...

263
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,304
Close your eyes.

264
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,903
Maybe that's one
you can cross off your list.

265
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,324
Oh, yeah. Heh.

266
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,286
Oh, and plus,
I'm one-sixteenth Portuguese.

267
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,504
Okay, is everybody clear?
We're gonna pick it up...

268
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,340
...and move it.

269
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:18,679
All we need is teamwork, okay?
We're gonna lift the car...

270
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,016
...and slide it out.

271
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,103
Lift...

272
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,605
...and slide.

273
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,525
- Ross, I really don't think this...
- Lift...

274
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,861
...and slide.

275
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,697
- Okay, here we go.
- All right, everyone.

276
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,574
Lift...

277
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,455
...and slide.

278
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:52,463
- Hey, Joey...
- Oh, come on, Rach, my turn just started.

279
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,925
Actually, I just want to talk to Tag.

280
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,137
Oh, okay.
Hey, can I ride this outside?

281
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,889
- Whatever, okay? I'm not your mother.
- Okay.

282
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,142
- Not in the street!
- Yeah.

283
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,603
- Hey.
- Hey.

284
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:12,859
- How you doing, you feeling any better?
- Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm, um...

285
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,112
- Let's talk.
- Okay.

286
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,573
- Um...
- What's up?

287
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,159
Uh, Tag, um...

288
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:25,079
You're such a great guy,
and we have so much fun together.

289
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,497
- But I...
- Wait.

290
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,417
I think I see where you're going.

291
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:33,379
But before you say anything else,
can I just say one more thing?

292
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,264
Well said.

293
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,895
And a, uh, good example of the fun
I was referring to.

294
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:55,276
Uh, but, heh, I think I'm past the point
where I can, you know, just have fun.

295
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,988
Rachel, don't do this.
This is just because you're turning 30.

296
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,990
Yeah, it is.

297
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,952
But you're just a kid.
I mean, you're 25.

298
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,788
- Twenty-four, actually.
- Oh, God.

299
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:15,171
You know what I wish?
I wish you were six years older.

300
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:19,800
Well, actually, if I'm wishing for stuff,
I actually wish I was six years younger.

301
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,638
- Me too.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

302
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,981
Hey, how'd it go?

303
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,399
Oh.

304
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:40,071
If I only want two kids,
can I keep him for another year?

305
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,324
You did the right thing.

306
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,081
I don't like this anymore.

307
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,172
Well, here we are.
Just a bunch of 30-year-olds.

308
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:03,678
Wow, do you realize in 10 years
we're gonna be 40?

309
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:12,019
Why, God?
Why are you doing this to us?

310
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,697
Yes. My baby's finally free.

311
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,198
All right.

312
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,867
Start it up. Let's go.

313
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,246
Whoo-hoo!

314
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,420
How hot are we?

315
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,221
You wanna buy a car?
