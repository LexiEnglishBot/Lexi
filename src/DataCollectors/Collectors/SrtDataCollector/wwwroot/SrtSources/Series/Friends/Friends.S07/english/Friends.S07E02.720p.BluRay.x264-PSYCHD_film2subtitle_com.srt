1
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:06,422
- Hey. Who wants French toast?
- Oh, I'll have some.

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,758
Me too. Eggs and milk in the fridge.
Thanks.

3
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:11,760
Ow.

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,430
- Oh, what's the matter, honey?
- My hand feels weird.

5
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:16,557
I guess it's because I'm engaged.

6
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,020
- When will that start getting annoying?
- Start?

7
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,606
So let's actually get started
on the wedding plans.

8
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:25,941
- Okay.
- Already?

9
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:28,777
Yeah, we got a lot to do.
We gotta think about the flowers...

10
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,362
...the caterers, the music...

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,407
- Oh, I got some thoughts on the music...
- Chandler, too many cooks...

12
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:39,413
Take it from me. All you have to do
is show up and try to say the right name.

13
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,709
Okay.

14
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,171
- What in God's name is that?
- Oh, my God, the wedding book?

15
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,798
I haven't seen that since the 4th grade.

16
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:55,137
This baby has everything.
Take, you know, locations for instance:

17
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:59,099
First organized alphabetically,
then geographically...

18
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,643
...then by square footage.

19
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,606
That is so smart. Ha.

20
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,275
Break it off. Ahem. Break it off, now.

21
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,901
And that should conclusively prove...

22
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,905
...that I had the idea
for Jurassic Park first.

23
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,032
- Now, let's take a look...
- Hey, Ross.

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,451
Phoebe, oh, my God,
what are you doing here?

25
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,122
I need to talk to you. It's pretty urgent.
It's about Monica and Chandler.

26
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,541
Oh, my God. Um, of course.

27
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,335
Uh, would you please excuse me
for a moment?

28
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:12,589
Um, heh, do you know each other's
hometowns? Why don't you?

29
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,925
What's going on?

30
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:19,721
Well, um, not much. I was just thinking
that since those guys just got engaged...

31
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,224
...that maybe it'd be nice
if they had some privacy.

32
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:26,103
So could I just move in with you
for a couple days?

33
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,897
Um...

34
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:32,734
Okay, yeah, sure. But what's wrong
with Monica and Chandler?

35
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,154
Nothing. Why?

36
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,907
Phoebe, you said it was urgent.

37
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,286
Oh, yeah, it is. I'm going to the movies
and it starts in like five minutes.

38
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:49,626
Do you realize I have a classroom
full of students?

39
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:55,591
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude.
Does anyone want to come to the movies?

40
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,930
I haven't cleared the
budget with my parents yet...

41
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,724
...but tell me how this is for music.

42
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:08,103
All right, um, a string quartet for the
processional, a jazz trio for cocktails...

43
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,606
...the Bay City Rollers
for dancing...

44
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,733
Wait, that was
for my 6th grade wedding.

45
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:18,572
Well, you couldn't get them anyway.
Ian doesn't play anymore, and Derek...

46
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,993
Well, Derek is a name I shouldn't know.

47
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:27,873
Hey, Mon, do you have another pillow,
you know, something a little snugglier?

48
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,293
Why are you napping over here
instead of over at your place?

49
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,587
- The duck.
- What, the duck?

50
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,131
What the hell
did the damn duck do now?

51
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:41,470
Uh, well, he did not get sick
somewhere in there...

52
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,973
...and it was immediately found
and properly cleaned up.

53
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,893
Now, do I get to look at this book...

54
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,355
...or is it just for people who are actually
involved in the wedding?

55
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,816
Of course you can look at it.
Yeah, I want your opinion too.

56
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,652
- Okay.
- Here you go.

57
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,404
- What do you think about centerpieces?
- Centerpieces.

58
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,658
- Roses or lilies?
- Definitely roses.

59
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:10,332
Well, I just think they're a bit more
wedding-y, you know.

60
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:16,004
- But lilies are the clear choice.
- Oh, my God, it's like one mind.

61
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,673
Uh-huh.

62
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,927
Guys, guys, you gotta let me nap.

63
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,680
I'm gonna get cranky.

64
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:29,059
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch
across the hall.

65
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,561
Yes, it is perfectly good...

66
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:35,274
...and it is not one of the places
the duck got sick.

67
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,359
What?

68
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,863
- All right, I'm gonna go.
- Joey, what did the duck do?

69
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:45,075
I don't know,
but he did not eat your face cream.

70
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,921
Hey, little buddy.

71
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,258
How you feeling? Aah.

72
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,179
What the hell is in that face cream?

73
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,987
That's so soft.

74
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,783
Pillowcases.

75
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,913
Oh, ah.

76
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:46,303
"Zelda looked at the chimney
sweep. Her father, the vicar..."

77
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,846
Vicar?

78
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,433
"...wouldn't be home for hours.

79
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,602
Her loins were burning.

80
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:58,023
She threw caution to the wind
and reached out and grabbed his..."

81
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:02,944
Whoa.

82
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,781
This is a dirty book.

83
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,463
Uh, Phoebe?

84
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,298
Oh, Ross, hi.

85
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:29,805
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.

86
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,267
- Phoebe.
- Okay, let's talk outside.

87
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,480
Phoebe, you can't massage people
in my apartment.

88
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,191
What's the big deal?
I did it at Monica and Chandler's.

89
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,068
And they knew about it?

90
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,408
Okay, look, Ross,
what is this really about?

91
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:53,870
Look, this is my home, and I want to
be able to come and go whenever I want.

92
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,499
Okay. I will find someplace else
to do the rest of my appointments.

93
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,501
I just don't know what the big deal is.

94
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,671
The big deal is I don't want naked,
greasy strangers in my apartment...

95
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,175
...when I want to kick back with a puzzle...
Beer, cold beer.

96
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,055
Hey, Joey. What are you doing?

97
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,309
Sweeping. Why? Does it turn you on?

98
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,688
No.

99
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,690
Hmm.

100
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:25,068
What if I was, uh, sweeping a chimney?

101
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,322
Joey, did you eat my face cream?

102
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,454
Where are you going?
The vicar won't be home for hours.

103
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,878
Joey...

104
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,380
...where did you learn that word?

105
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,718
Where do you think...

106
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,386
...Zelda?

107
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:57,601
- You found my book?
- Yeah, I did.

108
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,605
Joey, what are you doing
going into my bedroom?

109
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,732
Okay, I'm sorry.
I went in there to take a nap.

110
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,734
And I know I shouldn't have,
but you got porn.

111
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,444
Ugh.

112
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,906
You know what? I don't care.
I'm not ashamed of my book.

113
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:15,952
There's nothing wrong with a woman
enjoying a little erotica.

114
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:20,081
It's just a healthy expression
of female sexuality...

115
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:24,294
...which, by the way, is something
that you will never understand.

116
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,465
You got porn.

117
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:54,115
- Hello.
- Hi, is, uh, Phoebe here?

118
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:58,286
- Uh, no, no, she's out for the night.
- Oh, great.

119
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,456
Heh. Can I help you with something?

120
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,667
I don't know. Are you a masseur?

121
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,794
Yes, I am.

122
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,173
Great. Dad?

123
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,140
Thank you so much.
I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.

124
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,066
So, Chandler, your parents
must've been thrilled...

125
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,734
...when you told them
you were engaged.

126
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,195
Oh, yeah.
I should probably call them.

127
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,490
I remember when we first got engaged.

128
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,867
- I don't think I've heard that story.
- Dad, you don't...

129
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,328
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant.

130
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,999
I still don't know how.

131
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:48,503
You don't know how? Your dog
thought my diaphragm was a chew toy.

132
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,258
What a sweet story.

133
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,220
At least you're not hearing it
at your 5th grade Halloween party.

134
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,097
What? They wanted a scary story.

135
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,101
Anyway, we're really excited
about our wedding plans.

136
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,980
Pretty soon we'll be making a big
withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.

137
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,904
- What?
- You tell her, Jack. I can't do it.

138
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,699
What happened?
You still have the wedding fund, don't you?

139
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:21,119
We have it.
Only now we call it "the beach house."

140
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:28,168
I can't believe you spent my wedding fund
on the beach house.

141
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,711
We're sorry. We assumed...

142
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,839
...if you got married after you turned 30
you'd pay for it yourself.

143
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,675
You bought the beach house
when I was 23.

144
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,178
Which means you had seven years
of beach fun...

145
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,430
...and you can't put a price on that,
sweetie.

146
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,934
We really do feel bad about this though.

147
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,228
We started saving again
when you dated Richard.

148
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,898
But then that went to hell,
so we redid the kitchen.

149
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,277
What about when I started
dating Chandler?

150
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,780
It was Chandler.
We didn't think he'd ever propose.

151
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:02,577
Clearly I did not start drinking enough
at the start of the meal. Heh.

152
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,871
I can't believe there is no money
for my wedding.

153
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,083
We might still have some
if your father hadn't thought...

154
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,085
...to sell ice over the Internet.

155
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,963
- It seemed like such a simple idea.
- Stupid, Jack. The word is stupid.

156
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,425
All right, enough.
I don't want to hear about it anymore.

157
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,094
Good luck, Chandler.

158
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,622
Okay, now I'm going to...

159
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,542
...touch you.

160
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,178
Oh, that's soft.

161
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,999
I can't believe this. Do you think
your parents could help pay for it?

162
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,333
I don't know.

163
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:36,671
My mother spent most of her money
on her fourth wedding.

164
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,215
She's saving the rest for her divorce.

165
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:44,220
And any extra cash my father has,
he saves for his yearly trips to...

166
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,347
...Dollywood.

167
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,934
What happened at dinner?

168
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,228
My parents spent the money
for our wedding.

169
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,607
My God, what did you order?

170
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:01,738
Wait, there's no money?
Well, this is terrible.

171
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:05,492
You guys are gonna have to get married
in, like, a rec center.

172
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:10,663
- Honey, it's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not gonna be okay. It sucks.

173
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:14,709
- No swing band, no lilies.
- No, you know what? It's gonna be okay.

174
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,712
I mean, you don't need to have this...

175
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,799
...rustic Italian feast, you know?

176
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:27,514
And you don't need this custom-made
empire-waisted, duchess satin gown.

177
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,432
You can wear off-the-rack.

178
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,439
Look, it really is gonna be okay.

179
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,819
The important thing is that we love
each other and we're gonna get married.

180
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,739
Do you even understand
what "off-the-rack" means?

181
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,576
Why don't you just pay for it yourself?

182
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,286
How? I don't have any money.

183
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,539
- Well, I have some.
- How much?

184
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,790
Well, close to...

185
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,638
- Whoa! Are you kidding me?
- What? How much?

186
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,766
- It's enough for wedding scenario A.
- Really?

187
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,853
How great are you, you little saver? Heh.

188
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,939
The amount you have is exactly
the budget of my dream wedding.

189
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,067
Oh, you guys
are so made for each other.

190
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,446
Well, you're not suggesting we spend
all of the money on the wedding?

191
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,448
Uh, yeah.

192
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,662
Look, Mon, I've been saving this money
for six years...

193
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:37,125
...and I kind of have some of it earmarked
for the future, not just for a party.

194
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:41,337
Wow. Hello, Mr. Chandler.

195
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,302
Sweetie, this is the most special day
of our lives.

196
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:51,389
I realize that, honey, but I'm not gonna
spend all the money on one party.

197
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,058
Honey, um, I love you. Heh.

198
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,520
But, um, if you call our wedding a party
one more time...

199
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,355
...you may not get invited.

200
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:06,112
We can always earn more money, okay?
But we're only gonna get married once.

201
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:10,742
Look, I understand, but I have to put
my foot down, okay? The answer is no.

202
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,162
You're gonna have
to put your foot down?

203
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,664
Yes, I am.

204
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,836
Wow. Money and a firm hand.

205
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,672
Finally a Chandler
I can get on board with.

206
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,683
- Hey, Rach.
- Joey.

207
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,188
Hey, Rach, do you smell smoke?

208
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:44,651
Uh-huh. I get it. Smoke, chimney,
chimney sweep. Very funny. Ha, ha.

209
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,780
No, no, no, I'm serious.
You don't smell it?

210
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,698
Something's on fire.

211
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,867
No, I don't smell anything.

212
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,788
Oh, you know what?
It's probably just your burning loins.

213
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,545
- Hey, what are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

214
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,051
Mm, damn, this coffee's cold.

215
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,470
Hey, Rach, do you mind
if I heat this up on your loins?

216
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,269
You know, I cannot believe
you told him. Joey...

217
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,898
So I guess you bought that book
after we broke up, huh?

218
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,735
Uh-huh, I did, because I wore out
my first copy when I was with you.

219
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,238
Oh, yeah? Yeah?

220
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:34,701
Well, uh, when we were going out,
I read tons of porno magazines.

221
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,953
'Sup?

222
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:42,417
Ross, how could you do that
to an old man?

223
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,754
Excuse me, ladies.

224
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,257
I'm sorry?

225
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,843
My massage client, Arthur.

226
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,762
His daughter called and said
some guy that worked for me...

227
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,098
...gave him a really weird massage
this afternoon.

228
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:00,226
I gave him an extremely
professional massage.

229
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,813
He said you poked
at him with wooden spoons.

230
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,774
Okay, so it wasn't
a traditional massage.

231
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,111
But I did give him acupressure
with a pair of chopsticks...

232
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,532
...and I gently exfoliated him
with a mop.

233
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:20,538
Well, he's never coming back, okay?
You just cost me $80 a week.

234
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:24,000
You know what? This is your fault.
You didn't move his appointment.

235
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,253
Oh, it's my fault?
You didn't have to massage him.

236
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,755
You could've sent him away.

237
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,674
You could've not rolled Tonka trucks
up and down his back.

238
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,970
He said he liked that.

239
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,392
You're right, you're right.
I'm sorry.

240
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,979
Dude, what are you massaging
an old man for?

241
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,525
- His daughter was hot.
- Gotcha.

242
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,993
- Hey.
- Hey.

243
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,287
Listen, um...

244
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,165
...I've been thinking.

245
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:09,337
And it's not fair for me to ask you
to spend all your money on our wedding.

246
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,507
I mean, you work really hard for that.

247
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,926
- Well.
- Well, you work for that.

248
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,596
Look, I thought about it too.

249
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:24,352
And I'm sorry. I think we should spend
all of the money on the wedding.

250
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:29,190
- You do?
- Yeah, I'm putting my foot down.

251
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,986
Yeah, look, when I proposed, I told you...

252
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:37,365
...that I would do anything
to make you happy.

253
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,952
And if having the perfect wedding
makes you happy...

254
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,329
...then that's what we're gonna do.

255
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,124
You are so sweet.

256
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,086
Oh, but wait.

257
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:53,214
What about our...?
What about the future and stuff?

258
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,716
Ah, forget about the future and stuff.

259
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,343
So we only have two kids.

260
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,389
You know, we'll pick our favorite
and that one will get to go to college.

261
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,059
- Have you thought about that?
- Yeah.

262
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,936
How many kids were we gonna have?

263
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,857
Uh, four. A boy, twin girls
and another boy.

264
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,652
What else did you think about?

265
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,655
Well, heh, stuff like where we'd live,
you know.

266
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,575
Like a small place outside the city...

267
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,995
...where our kids could learn
to ride their bikes and stuff.

268
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,081
We could have a cat that had a bell
on its collar...

269
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:31,878
...and we could hear it every time
it ran through the little kitty door.

270
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:36,132
Of course we'd have an apartment
over the garage where Joey could grow old.

271
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,889
You know what?

272
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,767
I don't want a big, fancy wedding.

273
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,312
- Sure you do.
- No.

274
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:55,610
I want everything that you've just said.
I want a marriage.

275
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,113
- You sure?
- Mm-hm.

276
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,118
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

277
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,127
Hey, listen, when you were talking
about our future, you said cat.

278
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,838
But you meant dog, right? Ha, ha.

279
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,635
- Ha, yeah, totally.
- Oh, good.

280
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,065
Hello, Zelda.

281
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,278
- Who are you supposed to be?
- The vicar.

282
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:44,116
- Do you even know what a vicar is?
- Like a goalie, right?

283
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,743
Yeah.

284
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,870
Look, Joey, it's enough, all right?

285
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:51,123
You keep making these stupid jokes
and these sleazy innuendoes...

286
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,209
...and it's just not funny anymore.

287
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,712
All right, I'm sorry. Rach, I'm sorry.
Okay? I'm sorry.

288
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:01,217
Maybe I could make it up to you
by taking you roughly in the barn.

289
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,885
Ugh.

290
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:07,265
All right, you know what? That's it.
You want to do it? Let's do it.

291
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,392
Huh?

292
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,186
That's right.
I want to do it with you.

293
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:18,651
Been trying to fight it,
but you just said all the right things.

294
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,278
Uh, I did?

295
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,698
Yeah, oh, I've been waiting so long
to get on that body.

296
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:27,159
- This body?
- Yeah, that's right.

297
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,453
Come on, Joey, sex me up.

298
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:33,332
Hey, you're starting to sound like
the butcher's wife there in chapter seven.

299
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:37,837
Oh, come on, now. Don't keep me waiting.
Get those clothes off.

300
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:42,300
But I would keep that helmet on,
because you're in for a rough ride.

301
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,303
I don't want to. I'm scared.
