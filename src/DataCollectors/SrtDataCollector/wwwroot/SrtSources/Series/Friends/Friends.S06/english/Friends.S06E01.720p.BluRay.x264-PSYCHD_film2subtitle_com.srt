1
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:06,088
Okay, this is it.

2
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:08,382
You sure you wanna do this?

3
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:14,847
Hello, Mrs. Ross. Woo-hoo!

4
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:18,267
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel.

5
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:28,277
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,238
Come on, Pheebs, hurry!
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

7
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,157
Okay! Okay!

8
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,995
Oh, my God!
Is everybody getting married?

9
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,750
- Agh.
- No running in the chapel.

10
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,919
Hey, don't you give me
any of your... Hey!

11
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,588
- Hi.
- Hey!

12
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,006
What are you doing here?

13
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:52,426
Ross and Rachel left a message.
They're getting married.

14
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,511
- Isn't that why you guys are here?
- Yes.

15
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,847
- Why else would we be here?
- Ha-ha-ha.

16
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,769
Well, what happened? Did we miss it?

17
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,312
We actually missed it.

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,648
Maybe you wouldn't have
if you could run in the chapel!

19
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,984
This is insane.

20
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,154
What's the big deal?
It's not like it's a real marriage.

21
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,156
What?

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,160
If you marry in Vegas,
you're only married in Vegas.

23
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,248
What? If you marry here,
you're married everywhere.

24
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,583
Really?

25
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,251
Yeah.

26
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,962
Oh, my God.

27
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,882
Oh, well.

28
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,264
Mm.

29
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,127
Why are we in bed together?

30
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,628
I don't know.

31
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,841
Do you have any clothes on?

32
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,718
Yes.

33
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,178
- Really?
- No.

34
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,804
Ugh...

35
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,225
But we didn't have...

36
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,770
...sex, did we?

37
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,317
I don't remember much about last night.

38
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:16,737
- It was such a blur. Ha, ha.
- Oh.

39
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,113
Oh!

40
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,283
- I remember laughing. I laughed a lot.
- Uh-huh?

41
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,868
Then we didn't have sex.

42
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,168
Oh, I mean, we were really drunk.

43
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,170
I'm glad we didn't do anything stupid.

44
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,005
Tell me about it.

45
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,179
- Morning, Pheebs.
- Mm.

46
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,933
Well, my movie has been
officially canceled.

47
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,769
Mm. Joey, I'm so sorry.

48
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,187
You want my breakfast?

49
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,898
Eh, too depressed to eat.

50
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,442
I'll probably eat in, like, five minutes.

51
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,404
So I guess I'll fly home with you.
What time is your flight?

52
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,199
- What about my cab?
- I don't need that anymore.

53
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:06,036
No, you borrowed my cab.
You have to drive it back.

54
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,289
I don't wanna drive back
by myself. I get lonely.

55
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,042
Oh, ooh. How about if you come with me?

56
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,544
- I don't know, it's a long trip.
- That would be great.

57
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,172
We could talk and play games.

58
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:21,385
This could be our chance to,
like, renew our friendship.

59
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,097
Are you asking me
to have a "frienaissance"?

60
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,975
Sure?

61
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:33,272
Heh. All right, although I don't think we
need one. I never stopped loving you.

62
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,066
- Hey.
- Hey.

63
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,276
- Hey.
- Hey.

64
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,028
So has anybody talked
to Dr. And Mrs. Geller yet?

65
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,240
Mm-hm. They left me a message.
They'll be here.

66
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,701
Where is the waitress? I'm starving.

67
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,871
It's a buffet, man.

68
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,542
Here's where I win all my money back!

69
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,462
I gotta talk to you.

70
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,714
Sure.

71
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,090
What's up?

72
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,851
Monica and I almost got married.

73
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,477
My God!

74
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,314
That's huge! Ha-ha-ha, hey.

75
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,900
Wait a minute. Why wasn't I invited?

76
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:24,114
And who was gonna be your best man?
Don't say Ross. Do not say Ross.

77
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:28,660
I just don't think that Monica and I
are ready yet. I love her...

78
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:32,372
...but seeing Ross and Rachel
come out of that chapel...

79
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:37,586
...was like a wake-up call that Monica
and I are moving so fast, you know.

80
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,881
How do I tell her
without crushing her?

81
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,549
Oh!

82
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,510
Tell her she's not marriage material.

83
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,847
What?

84
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,476
Girls say it to me all the time.

85
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:58,440
And if she's anything like me,
she's just gonna be relieved.

86
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,611
How do I tell him that it's too soon?

87
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,238
He's gonna think
I don't love him anymore.

88
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,741
- Well, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

89
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,868
Good. I was just testing you.

90
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,246
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

91
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,582
We were just talking about bacon.

92
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,043
No, we were talking about tennis.

93
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,504
Tennis is more believable.

94
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,092
Hey.

95
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,302
- Hi.
- Thank you.

96
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,390
- Coffee. Heh.
- Mm.

97
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,482
- What?
- Are we gonna talk...

98
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,859
...about what you guys did last night,
or?

99
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:48,490
What do you mean "last night"?
Nothing, uh, happened last night.

100
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,993
Uh-huh. Ross invited us all to watch.

101
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,249
Rach, we weren't gonna miss
our friends marrying.

102
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,334
Huh, who got married?

103
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,921
You did?

104
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,173
- What?
- Heh.

105
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,927
- Wh...? Hello. We didn't get married.
- No, we didn't. That's ridi...

106
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,477
Wait, wait, wait.
I remember being in a chapel.

107
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:21,148
They would not let us get married
when we were that drunk.

108
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,400
They let you get married.

109
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,819
Most people who marry
in Vegas are drunk.

110
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,156
Heh, I'm drunk right now.

111
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:34,786
I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?
I'm on vacation.

112
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,621
What are you gonna do?

113
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,249
- Well, I guess we find a divorce lawyer.
- Uh-huh.

114
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,586
Well, I think,
I think Ross already has one.

115
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,798
Now, this one's free, right?

116
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,384
Because you paid for the first two,
third one free.

117
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,304
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you...

118
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,015
...because we don't need to get divorced.

119
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:58,059
- We're just gonna get an annulment.
- An annulment?

120
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,730
Ross, I don't think surgery
is the answer here.

121
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,859
Oh, that's your thing!

122
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,944
What?

123
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,157
Your thing, that you're the guy
who gets divorced.

124
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,825
Oh, yeah.

125
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,453
No, no, that's not "my thing."

126
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,164
I do not love getting divorced.

127
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,751
Yes, you do. This is your third divorce.

128
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,588
You love divorce so much,
you're probably gonna marry it...

129
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,801
...and then it won't work out, so you're
gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy.

130
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,595
Ha-ha-ha.

131
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,472
I'm so drunk.

132
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,524
- So, what should we do?
- I don't know.

133
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,400
I know I love you.

134
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,528
- I know I love you.
- Heh.

135
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,660
Where are we on the whole
"going back...

136
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,871
...to where they have the marriages"
thing? I love you.

137
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,374
That's a good question.

138
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,418
Last night we let the dice decide.

139
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,588
We should leave it
up to fate again. I love you!

140
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,383
We don't get married
unless there's a sign.

141
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,176
Okay? So say, uh...

142
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:17,430
You roll another eight, then there's a sign
that we should get married.

143
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,224
All right. Eight we get married...

144
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,770
...but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10,
11, 12, we don't get married.

145
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,105
- Sounds great.
- Okay.

146
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,148
Hey, we got a shooter.

147
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,692
Money, please.

148
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:29,943
- Ready?
- Ready.

149
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,987
Come on, eight.

150
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,075
Yes, yes, eight.

151
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,954
Eight, easy eight.

152
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:47,627
- Wow, I can't believe I rolled an eight.
- That was so unlikely.

153
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,841
- Well, let's get married. I guess.
- Aah.

154
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,510
That wasn't hard.
Last night I rolled a hard eight.

155
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,638
It was the wrong kind of eight.
No wedding! Damn it!

156
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,100
- Agh! Aah!
- Unh, I wanted it so bad!

157
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:05,979
- Wanna go pack?
- Yeah.

158
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,068
- We're doing the right thing, right?
- Oh, of course we are.

159
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,446
Heh, we left it up to fate.

160
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,283
If we were supposed to get married,
there would be a sign.

161
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:30,170
Okay, you have 19 questions left.
Use them wisely.

162
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,051
Come on, Joey.
You can't win if you don't ask any...

163
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,260
...questions!

164
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,471
Aah! Aah.

165
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,058
- What?
- You promised me a fun road trip.

166
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,936
We've been on the road for 6 hours,
and you've been asleep for 5 and a half.

167
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,398
We are switching,
and you are going to drive back.

168
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:54,444
That will be your punishment,
you greedy sleeper.

169
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,488
All right. All right.

170
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,574
Yeah. And until then,
you are going to sing to me.

171
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:04,120
Because the radio's broken, and you are
selfish, but you have a nice voice.

172
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,623
- Really?
- Sing!

173
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:12,462
I wanna rock 'n' roll all night

174
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,721
Man, this is a long drive.

175
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,599
Are my eyes open?

176
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,309
No!

177
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,702
- Morning.
- Aah!

178
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,419
- Hey.
- Hey, hubby. Heh.

179
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,966
Yeah. Actually, um,
I wanted to talk to you...

180
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,552
...about that whole annulment thing.
- Uh-huh?

181
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,804
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

182
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,610
- Okay.
- Heh.

183
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,156
So we'll just stay married.

184
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,657
Yes, exactly.

185
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,661
And I will make everyone
call me Mrs. Geller.

186
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,956
Wow, this is so amazing.

187
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:34,002
I, uh, really thought I'd have
to talk you into this more.

188
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:39,007
Ha, ha. Now I'm scared because
I don't actually think you're kidding.

189
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,093
I'm not kidding.

190
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,803
Look, I... I... Heh.

191
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:47,223
I can't have three failed marriages.

192
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,058
I can't, okay?

193
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,437
I am not gonna be that guy.

194
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,735
So, what, we just stay married forever?

195
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,445
Okay, how...?

196
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,573
How is this going to affect you, really?

197
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,537
I mean, you fill some form out
once in a while...

198
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:13,917
...instead of checking the box "Miss,"
you check the box that says, "Mrs."

199
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,045
It's right next to it.

200
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,841
Okay. I'm sorry, you're right.
You know what?

201
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,802
We can stay married...

202
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:28,640
...because I thought that the boxes
were far away from each other.

203
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,353
All right. Look, just...

204
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,522
...please take a moment here...

205
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,650
...and think about what
you're asking of me. Okay?

206
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:44,072
I am asking you to do me a favor.

207
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:49,911
You are asking me to be your wife.

208
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,041
And, as my wife, I think
you should grant me this favor.

209
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,089
That kid kicked me really hard.

210
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,299
Well, you did pull his hair.

211
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,845
- He took my snack.
- I'm not getting into this again.

212
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,639
All right, you know what?
Hurts really bad.

213
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,891
Well, I told you not to walk. Here.

214
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,560
There. There. Okay.

215
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,655
- This doesn't mean anything, does it?
- No.

216
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,661
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?

217
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:36,499
He could be a rape... He could be
a rapist or a killer or something.

218
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,419
Don't you think I asked him that
before he got in?

219
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,922
I'm not talking to you.
You go back to sleep.

220
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,592
- And, you, are you a rapist?
- No.

221
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,510
Do you like car games?

222
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,971
Yeah, you know the, uh,
license plate game?

223
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,890
I love the license plate game!

224
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,017
Ooh, I'll play. I'll play.

225
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,269
No, you need your sleep.
Night-night. Shh.

226
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,235
- Hey.
- Hey.

227
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,863
Listen. I know you wanted to talk to me...

228
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,533
...but I have an idea that may
make you wanna stay married.

229
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,201
Uh...

230
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,245
We register...

231
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,040
...and you get to keep all the presents.

232
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,880
No, Ross, come on. No, listen.

233
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:28,134
I've thought about how to tell you this,
and, um, the bottom line, Ross...

234
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,929
...is we cannot stay married.

235
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,808
- I don't know if that's true...
- Oh, but it is.

236
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,436
Ahem. Okay. You know what this is?

237
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,357
This is a difference of opinion.

238
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,028
- When that happens in a marriage...
- Oh, Ross, come on!

239
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:51,199
This is not a marriage!
This is the world's worst hangover!

240
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,662
Ross, listen, if you do not
get this annulment, I will.

241
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,542
All right. All right, I'll do it.

242
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,127
Thank you.

243
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,339
Hey, hey, um...

244
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:10,093
...uh, is there any such thing
as an annulment shower?

245
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,766
There's the train station, where I get off.

246
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,268
Well, I have your address
and phone number.

247
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,563
And I have your name
and the fact that you're a drifter.

248
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,566
So ball's pretty much in your court.

249
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,152
All right. See you, Pheebs.

250
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,414
Come on, Pheebs,
I can't take this anymore.

251
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,873
Please talk to me.

252
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,712
Let me make it up to you, huh?

253
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,717
Ground control to Major Tom

254
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,972
Commencing countdown
Engines on

255
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:04,355
Take your protein pills
And put your helmet on

256
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,274
Pssh, this is...

257
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,901
Stop it! Stop it! No.

258
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,865
That's not fair. You know I can't
resist that beautiful voice.

259
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,326
Pheebs, look, I am so sorry.

260
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,204
I promised you a fun
road trip with your friend...

261
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,124
...and I didn't deliver, okay?

262
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:28,296
Now I know that you think being awake
is an important part of friendship.

263
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:33,342
So I will strive to stay awake
for as long as I know you.

264
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,556
You can still sleep
at night and stuff.

265
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,059
Thank you.

266
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,103
So can we play 20 Questions now?

267
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,148
I got a good one.
I thought about it since Kansas.

268
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,151
Okay.

269
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,445
Is it...

270
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,031
...a kind of hot sandwich?

271
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,075
Yes.

272
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,744
Is it a meatball sub?

273
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,913
That is incredible!

274
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,290
You are the master!

275
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,377
Aah! Bug!

276
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,425
- Ah! That's funny. You look like you're...
- Don't say it!

277
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,302
Don't even think it.

278
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,805
All right.

279
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,640
Chandler, enjoy your handful.

280
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,729
Should we just get married?

281
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,899
All the signs are telling us to do it.

282
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,275
I'm sick of the signs.

283
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,070
- I'm happy the way things are.
- Me too.

284
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,072
- I don't want change, do you?
- No.

285
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,534
All right then, nothing changes.
Everything stays the same!

286
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:43,496
Go unpack. It's been three days,
and it's driving me insane!

287
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,917
Jeez, relax, it's not like we're mar...
Aah, agh.

288
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,762
You know, I was thinking, what if I, uh...

289
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,806
...unpack here?

290
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,724
All your stuff would be here.

291
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,186
Well...

292
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,816
What if all my stuff was here?

293
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,319
Then you'd be going back
and forth all the time.

294
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,655
Doesn't make any sense.

295
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,490
Okay.

296
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:25,204
What if we live together,
and you understand what I'm saying?

297
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,126
Live together?

298
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,628
There've been no signs for that.

299
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,965
Me asking is kind of a sign.

300
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,430
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Okay!

301
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,852
Yes.

302
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,229
Okay. Okay, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

303
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,481
- Okay.
- Here's your key. Here's your key.

304
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,317
Now go out and christen it!

305
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,943
Go out and come back in!

306
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,696
Door hasn't been locked
in five years, but okay.

307
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,782
- Ready?
- Ready!

308
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,995
The key broke in the lock,
and I can't get in.

309
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,915
Wait. Oh, my God, I can't get out!

310
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,792
- This isn't a sign!
- No, it's a very old key!

311
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,337
- It's an old key!
- Oh, my God, it's old.

312
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,422
I love you.

313
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,967
I love you.

314
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,721
Are you hugging the door right now?

315
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,394
No.

316
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,522
Yeah, yeah, me neither.

317
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,401
Hey.

318
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,738
So did everything go all right
with the annulment?

319
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,866
Oh, yeah. No problems.
It's all taken care of.

320
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,368
Ross, thank you.

321
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,621
Do you wanna go see a movie?

322
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,623
- Yeah, why not?
- Pheebs?

323
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,708
Thanks, I've already seen one.

324
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,129
- Okay, um, I'm gonna get my sweater.
- Okay.

325
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,385
You wanna hear something weird?

326
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,970
Always.

327
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,723
I didn't get the annulment.

328
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,103
- What?
- We're still married.

329
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,564
Don't tell Rachel. See you later.

330
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,746
What are you doing?

331
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,456
Key is stuck in the lock.

332
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,208
I can fix it. Hold on.

333
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,753
Watch out, watch out.

334
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,261
It still doesn't work.

335
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,929
- I'm not finished.
- Oh.

336
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:01,027
Nice job, Joe.
You are quite the craftsman.
