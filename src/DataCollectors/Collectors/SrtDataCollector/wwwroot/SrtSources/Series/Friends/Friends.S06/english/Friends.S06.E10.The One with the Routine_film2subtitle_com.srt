1
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:06,755
Why is everybody using
these tiny, little lights nowadays?

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,049
I remember when people used big ones.

3
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,760
That's a good story, Grandpa.

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,347
- Hey.
ALL: Hey.

5
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:19,601
Wow. Monica's letting other people
help decorate her tree?

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,062
Did someone get her
drunk again, or?

7
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:26,859
Having a perfect tree is
not what Christmas is about.

8
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,986
It's about being with loved ones.

9
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,697
That is nice. And we're done.
Ta-da!

10
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,036
It just doesn't quite
feel like Christmas to me.

11
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,621
Oh, here.

12
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,668
See, now it feels like Christmas.

13
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,962
And that's the story of the dreidel.

14
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:35,010
Some people trace the Christmas tree
back to the Egyptians...

15
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,932
...who'd bring palm branches into huts
on the shortest day of the year...

16
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,726
...symbolizing life's
triumph over death.

17
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,896
And that was, like, 4000 years ago.

18
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:49,775
So around the same time
that you started telling this story.

19
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,364
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey. What's up?

20
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:59,868
I had to get out of the apartment.
Janine's stretching all over the place.

21
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,121
Everywhere I look she's like...

22
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,002
I can see why that's hard to resist.

23
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,463
I like her so much.

24
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,507
I'm sorry she doesn't feel the same.

25
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,467
I know. And she's so sweet.

26
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:19,429
I just want to feed her grapes
and brush her hair.

27
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:23,058
You are aware that she's
not a monkey, right?

28
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,689
I am so over Janine.

29
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:34,403
Yeah, at first I thought she was hot,
but now she's like old news.

30
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,364
- Hey, guys.
- Janine!

31
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,995
I'm gonna be a dancer on a TV special
for New Year's Eve.

32
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:47,166
It's called some sort of
Dickin' Rockin' Dicky Eve.

33
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,545
Hold it.

34
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:55,507
Are you talking about
Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve?

35
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,593
Yeah, that's what I said.

36
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,015
Oh, my God, we love that show!

37
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,268
Ross and I have been watching it
since I can remember.

38
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,897
You're still just a little
fat girl inside, aren't you?

39
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,651
I'm gonna be one of the party people.

40
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:19,698
You're gonna be a party person?
Those guys rock the most!

41
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:23,493
They said to bring someone.
Want to be my dance partner?

42
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,455
I would love to spend
New Year's with you.

43
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,458
They're taping tomorrow.
I don't understand why...

44
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,168
Well, how it works is...

45
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:35,172
...the part with Dick Clark
in Times Square is actually live.

46
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,467
But they tape some of the party stuff
ahead of time.

47
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,053
Not a lot of people know that.

48
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,139
Do you guys want to come too?

49
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,060
- Are you serious?
- We are there!

50
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,604
[LAUGHS]

51
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,232
What are you laughing at?

52
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:57,402
Well, I used to date him,
but you're still going out with her.

53
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,866
Thanks.
Great, so we can all go together.

54
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,077
I gotta run. I'll catch you later.

55
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,663
Bye, Janine.

56
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,625
Did she just ask me out on a date?

57
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,544
I don't think so.

58
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:18,173
She invited him to the biggest
party of the millennium.

59
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,926
Yeah, but she also invited
you and Ross.

60
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:24,388
I'm sorry, I don't think that
that was a romantic thing.

61
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,516
Well, maybe.
But, hey, I know how I can find out.

62
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,476
It's a New Year's Eve party.

63
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:34,147
So at midnight, I can kiss her.
And if she kisses me back, great.

64
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,192
If she says, "What are you doing?"

65
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,195
I can say, "It wasn't me,
it was New Year's."

66
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,908
That's better than Ross
kissing me in high school...

67
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:48,745
...and saying that he did it
because he needed Chap Stick.

68
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,874
It was a dry day.

69
00:04:56,254 --> 00:05:00,632
We are going to Dick Clark's
New Year's Rockin' Eve!

70
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:07,222
Oh, my God!

71
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,606
Okay, I've been on sets before...

72
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,567
...so let me give you some advice.

73
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:22,154
It's a show, but we're just dancing.
It's no big deal.

74
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,449
Important thing to remember:
Stay cool.

75
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,326
- Got it.
- Okay.

76
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,662
ROSS: Oh, my God!
It's just like I dreamed it!

77
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,290
Everyone! Gather up!

78
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,293
MONICA: Excuse us!
ROSS: Excuse us!

79
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,088
The music's gonna start,
you're gonna dance...

80
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,425
...we'll tape it. Don't look
at the camera. Questions?

81
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:47,346
Uh, yeah, I have a question.
Uh, when is this gonna air?

82
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,350
Yeah. Now, uh, you guys dance
over there...

83
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,353
...you guys, over there.
I want you two here.

84
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,521
- And everyone else, spread out.
JOEY: Ross.

85
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,484
So when is it gonna air?

86
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,991
You look in the kitchen,
I got the closet.

87
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,536
I can save you time, ladies.
I'm right here.

88
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:16,541
Yeah. Why don't you take a walk?
This doesn't concern you.

89
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,087
We're looking for our presents
from Monica.

90
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,588
CHANDLER:
That's terrible.

91
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,465
No, we do it every year.

92
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,134
Oh, well, that makes it not terrible.

93
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,179
Yeah, we never find them.

94
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,266
She's always bested us,
that wily... minx.

95
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,144
We'll search here for an hour...

96
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,064
...and then we'll go to Joey's
and search, okay?

97
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,651
- You can't look for Monica's presents.
- We have to.

98
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,988
You don't have to. And you can't,
because I live here too.

99
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,826
Well, then you should look with us.

100
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,411
Why?

101
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,372
Aren't you worried about
what to get Monica?

102
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,833
No, I have a great idea
for her present.

103
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,044
Oh, that's it?
A great idea? Oh, yeah?

104
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,840
What if she gets you
a great present...

105
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,217
...two mediums
and lots of little ones...

106
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,595
...and you just get her one present?
She'll feel bad.

107
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,390
Why would you do that to her?
Why? Why?

108
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,519
- If I help, we can find them faster!
- Right!

109
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,189
PHOEBE:
Ooh! Ooh! We have a live one!

110
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,109
- Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
- Yeah.

- Ooh! Who's it for?

I'd hide presents under the couch?

113
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,581
P.S. Chandler,
I knew they'd break you."

114
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,503
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.

115
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,382
We are so gonna find them this year.

116
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,428
You said you'd go across the hall
and look. Do you do that every year?

117
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,721
Yeah.

118
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,640
You don't go into the back
of my closet...

119
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,268
...and look under my gym bag
or anything?

120
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,480
- No. Never do that.
- No.

121
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,736
That's where Joey gave me stuff
to store that I've never seen.

122
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,491
Okay, that did not just happen.

123

[SMASH MOUTH'S "EVERY WORD
MEANS NO" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]

124
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,708
Here comes a camera.

125
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,003
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.

126
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,723
- Why do they keep doing that?
- Ugh!

127
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,809
We have to get up on one
of those platforms.

128
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,770
They've been taping them all day.

129
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,146
Right.

130
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,362
What'd you guys do
to get up on there?

131
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,155
We learned how to dance.

132
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,118
When you learned to dance, did you
forget how to put on underpants?

133
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,328
Yeah!

134
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,585
- Hey, you're a good dancer.
- Really?

135
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,004
You'd be better if you
loosened your hips.

136
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,882
- What do you mean?
- Like this.

137
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:16,471
That's it. Feel the rhythm.
That's better.

- Yeah, we came together.

Really, you think so? I don't.

145

I couldn't find anything...
Hey, wait!

146
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,764
Yeah, we found them.

147
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,058
They were in the guest room closet.

148
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,395
You have nothing to worry about
because they're crap.

149
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,275
Those are mine.
I got those for you.

150

Oh. Thanks, Chandler, they're great!

metal A-Z thing?

Oh. Okay, I'm sorry.
Thank you for my "az."

154

Make sure you put all that stuff
back in the closet.

155
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,467
Yes, okay.

156
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:40,221
By the way, I think it's really nice
of you that even after you moved...

157
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,224
...you still keep storing
that stuff for Joey.
