1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,713
How did the audition go?
- Incredible.

2
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:08,507
I met the director.
You'll never believe who it was.

3
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:09,758
Who?

4
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,593
I'll give you one hint.

5
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,138
Warren Beatty.

6
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,347
Wow.

7
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:18,726
There's just one thing
that might be a problem.

8
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,437
See, I had to kiss this guy.

9
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:24,106
Because he was just so darn cute?

10
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,276
No, part of the audition.
I'm up for the part of this guy...

11
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,111
...who the main guy kisses.

12
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:33,907
Well, you're an actor. I say
you just suck it up and you do it.

13
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,329
Or you just do it.

14
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,957
I did do it.
I'm a professional.

15
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,001
- What's the problem?
After the scene...

16
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,672
...Mr. Beatty comes up to me and
he says, "Good actor. Bad kisser. "

17
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,092
Can you believe that?
Me, not a good kisser.

18
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,719
That's like...

19
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,680
...Mother Teresa, not a good mother. Pfft.

20
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,975
Who cares what that guy thinks?

21
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,895
What does Warren Beatty
know about kissing? Heh.

22
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,815
Oh. Heh, heh.

23
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,568
The One With Barry and Mindy's Wedding

24
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,117
What did your agent say?

25
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,911
Yep. This kiss thing is
definitely a problem.

26
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,038
Mr. Beatty wants to see it again
on Monday.

27
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,333
Man, I gotta figure out
what I'm doing wrong.

28
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,336
Oh, okay. One of you girls
come over here and kiss me.

29
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,839
- Forget it.
- Yeah, right.

30
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,049
Hey, come on.
I need your help here.

31
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,761
I'll do it. I've kissed him before.
I can do it again.

32
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,139
See this, huh? This is a friend.

33
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,266
Uh-huh. Let's go.

34
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,226
Oh, wait. I have gum.

35
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,520
Okay.

36
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,948
Good. Very good. Firm, but tender.

37
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,867
I'd recommend you to a friend.

38
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,787
Then I don't know
what the problem is.

39
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,165
Maybe you're not used
to kissing men.

40
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,250
Maybe you tensed up a little.

41
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,127
Maybe you need to work on it.

42
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,254
Yeah, that makes sense.

43
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,219
Over my dead body.

44
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,934
And I'll be using
his dead body as a shield.

45
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,483
Come out, honey.
I'm telling you, you look good.

46
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,570
Tell her she looks good.
Tell her she looks good.

47
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,077
Oh, my God! Ha, ha, ha.

48
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,457
You look so good!

49
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,837
I cannot believe I have to walk down
the aisle in front of 200 people...

50
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,132
...looking like something
you drink when you're nauseous.

51
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,969
So don't.
I don't see why we have to go to this thing.

52
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,388
It's your ex-fiancÃ©'s wedding.

53
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,849
Because I promised Mindy I would.

54
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,894
Yeah, well, you promised Barry
you'd marry him.

55
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,357
You guys, I have to go.
I'm the maid of honor.

56
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,319
Besides, I need to be in a room
again with these people...

57
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,780
...and feel good about myself.

58
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:12,084
Someone's wearing the same clothes
they had on last night. Get a little action?

59
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,335
I may have.

60
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,128
Whoo-hoo! Stud!

61
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,006
- What's she look like?
We haven't met.

62
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,676
We stayed up all night talking
on the Internet.

63
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,637
Whoo-hoo! Geek!

64
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,724
I like this girl.
I seriously like this girl.

65
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,395
You know how I tend to get
a little defended and quippy?

66
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,814
- Get out.
- No. Please.

67
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:38,735
Well, she called me on it, okay?
She said, "Cut it out, get real. "

68
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,404
And I did.

69
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,780
Wow.

70
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,157
What's that like?

71
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,953
It's like this. Me.

72
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,371
No jokes.

73
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,582
Stop it.
You're freaking me out.

74
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,044
Yeah. I don't like you this way.

75
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,380
I'll see you guys later.

76
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,507
Bye, Richard.
- Bye-bye.

77
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,884
Bye, sweetie. I love you.

78
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,678
I love you too.

79
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,604
I think my boyfriend's
ever so dreamy.

80
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,150
I wonder what
our wedding will be like.

81
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,945
What are you talking about?
What wedding?

82
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,031
Come on. You never talk about that?

83
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,116
No, never.

84
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,577
We're just living in the moment.

85
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:32,789
It is so nice for once not to get
hung up on, "Where is this going?"

86
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,126
- Afraid to ask him?
- Could not be more terrified.

87
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,171
I think you should
seriously consider marriage.

88
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,175
Give Rachel another chance to dress
like Princess Bubble Yum.

89
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,597
Where's Benny?

90
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,891
There he is!

91
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,517
Where's Benny?

92
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,519
There he is!

93
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:01,943
That's probably why babies learn to talk,
so they can tell grownups to cut it out.

94
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,947
Hey, I got a question for you.

95
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,158
Just a little thing, no pressure.

96
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,451
Okay.

97
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,748
Do you ever, uh, think about the future?

98
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,166
Sure, I do.

99
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,460
Yeah? Am I in it?

100
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,712
Honey...

101
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,172
...you are it.

102
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,510
Oh, God.
You're about to get so lucky.

103
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:27,969
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

104
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,267
- Keep talking.
- Well...

105
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,396
...sometimes I think about
selling my practice.

106
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,358
We could move to France.

107
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,736
- Make French toast.
- Ooh.

108
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,154
Okay, so...

109
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,448
...we're in France...

110
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,576
...and we're making the toast.

111
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,288
Do you see a little bassinet
in the corner?

112
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,624
Like a hound?

113
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,878
Not a basset.

114
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,672
A bassinet.

115
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,176
You really need the bassinet?

116
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:12,597
Well, I just think the baby
would keep falling off the dog.

117
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:19,187
- Do you not see kids in our future?
- Oh. Heh.

118
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,772
I love children.

119
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,858
I have children.

120
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,486
I don't wanna be 70
when our kids go off to college...

121
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,405
...and our life can finally start.

122
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,577
- Hm.
- Look.

123
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,370
I want you...

124
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,913
...now.

125
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,960
Well, that's great.
We don't need to talk about this now.

126
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,423
Really, I mean this is so, like,
way, way, way in the future.

127
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:50,343
I'm talking hovercrafts
and apes taking over the planet. Heh, heh.

128
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,684
Come on, Chandler.
I want this part so much.

129
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,812
Just one kiss.
I won't tell anyone.

130
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,148
Joey, no means no.

131
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,359
Hey.

132
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,822
I'm sorry,
we don't have your sheep.

133
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,370
Aw, Rach, I think you look cute.

134
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,124
And you. You...

135
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:25,712
- You, I could eat you with a spoon.
- Get away from me. I said no.

136
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,758
Richard buzzed. He's downstairs.

137
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:33,303
Richard's here?
I should run down, say goodbye to him.

138
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,767
Bye.
Good luck.

139
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,104
How's your date
with your cyber-chick going?

140
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,606
Hey, what is all that?

141
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,901
It's a web site.
It's the Guggenheim Museum.

142
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,237
She likes art...

143
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,156
...and I like funny words.

144
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,992
What does she mean by "H.H."?

145
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,996
It means we're holding hands.

146
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,624
Are you the cutest?

147
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,085
I'm afraid I might just be.

148
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,840
I think it's so great
that you're totally into this person...

149
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,887
...yet for all you know, she could be
90 years old or have two heads.

150
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,807
It could be a guy.

151
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,769
It's not a guy, all right?
I know her.

152
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,480
It could be like a big, giant guy.

153
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:32,779
Man, I got this close to him,
and Monica kneed me in the back.

154
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,614
What's going on?

155
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,784
We're wondering if
Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.

156
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,911
Ask her how long she's gonna live.

157
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,746
Women live longer than men.

158
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,711
How do you not fall down more?

159
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:53,049
Okay, ask her what is her method
of birth control.

160
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,509
All right.

161
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,807
"My husband is sleeping
with his secretary. "

162
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,852
She's married?

163
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,688
At least we know she's a woman.

164
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,817
I can't believe she's married.

165
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,236
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

166
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,616
This must be really tough for you.

167
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,832
I read this article that says
you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings...

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,918
...because when pigeons eat rice,
it kills them.

169
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,713
That's why you never see
pigeons in sushi bars.

170
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,010
- See, we're having fun.
- Oh, absolutely.

171
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,139
I'm not even thinking about that thing
that we're not gonna think about.

172
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,641
Neither am I.

173
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,727
Hey, there.
Are you all right?

174
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:49,689
Yeah. But in the bathroom, I saw
the window I crawled out of at my wedding.

175
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,902
And, God, I just started thinking
I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't.

176
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:58,323
People are gonna be looking at me and
judging me and thinking about the last time.

177
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,950
Sweetie, it's gonna be okay.
It's a wedding.

178
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,119
Generally, people focus on the bride.

179
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,288
I know, you're right.

180
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,624
Alrighty.
Everybody look at me. Good.

181
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,418
It's time. Bridesmaids and ushers...

182
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,545
...let's see two lines.
Thank you.

183
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,091
I'll see you after the thing.

184
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,094
- Okay. Good luck.
- Thank you. Okay.

185
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,637
Okay.

186
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,598
Ah.

187
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,814
Why didn't you tell me?

188
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,065
What could I do?

189
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,360
Stand up and shout,
"Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!"

190
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,487
Oh, my God. This is so humiliating.

191
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,907
The only thing that tops that
was when I was in eighth grade...

192
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,703
...and I had to sing the "Copacabana"
in front of the entire school.

193
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,788
Two lines into it, I ran and freaked out.

194
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,332
Oh, my God. My entire life's flashing
before my eyes.

195
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,669
Rach, look, I remember that.
It wasn't so bad.

196
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,880
Ross, would you stop!
You got me. I'm dating you.

197
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,425
Rachel.

198
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,844
Hi, Mr. Weinberg. Hi, Mrs. Weinberg.

199
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,680
It's wonderful
to see you again, my dear.

200
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,267
In fact, I hardly expected
to see so much.

201
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,230
- You told me you didn't see anything.
- I tell you a lot of things.

202
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:17,193
Well, it's wonderful to have you
up and about again, dear.

203
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,945
Stay well.

204
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:24,951
That's the third time someone has
said something like that to me today.

205
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,953
- Rach!
Hi.

206
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,622
- Oh, my God, I'm married!
- I know!

207
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,417
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter,
hyphen, Farber.

208
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,587
I am so proud of you, Min.

209
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:36,838
Min.

210
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,424
Oh, Rach. Still here.

211
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:43,136
At our wedding, they were packing up
the chopped liver about now.

212
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,888
Yeah, I love that story.

213
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,266
Ahem. I have a question for you guys.

214
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,686
Why do people keep saying
it's good to see me up and about?

215
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,773
After you ran out on your wedding...

216
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:58,193
...Barry's parents told people
you were sort of...

217
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,569
...insane.

218
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,323
- Insane?
- From the syphilis.

219
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,116
What?

220
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,204
What were they gonna say?
You didn't love me anymore? Come on.

221
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,916
Angela?

222
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,501
Joey Tribbiani.

223
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:18,379
Listen, what are you doing tonight?

224
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:22,550
I know you're seeing that guy.
I was thinking maybe you could bring him...

225
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,053
Hello? Hello?

226
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:39,234
You gonna answer her? That's the 10th
bing-bong message she's sent.

227
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,821
- She wants to know what's wrong.
- What's wrong? You're married!

228
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,489
That's what's wrong!

229
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,201
Oh, my.

230
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,662
- What?
- She wants to meet you in person.

231
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,665
Look, Phoebe,
I wanted to meet her in person too.

232
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,167
But she's married.
She has a husband.

233
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,838
What if the husband is the wrong guy
and you are the right guy?

234
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,674
You don't get chances like this
all the time.

235
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,677
If you don't meet her, you'll
kick yourself when you're 80...

236
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,388
...which is hard to do
and that's how you break a hip.

237
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,559
Okay. I'll do it.

238
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:17,397
Okay, great! Put on your shoes
and then march out there and meet her.

239
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,525
No, wait! You have
to take a shower because ew!

240
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,026
And I'll get the...

241
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,405
No, you have to answer her.
Answer her first.

242
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,658
No, make some coffee
because it's too much.

243
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,745
Tall and tan, and young and lovely

244
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:36,207
Okay, one more, please.
I'm gonna get it in this time.

245
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,293
Okay, last chance.

246
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,842
Again, I'm sorry.

247
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,600
You know what, maybe I don't
need to have children.

248
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:57,478
Maybe I just think I do
because that's what society...

249
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,731
...and by that I mean my mom...

250
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,984
...has always convinced me that I...

251
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,070
But I want her so badly

252
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,157
I do.

253
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,035
I have to have children.
I'm sorry, I just do.

254
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,998
Yo, could I have your attention?

255
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,334
Best man making a toast here.

256
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,127
Thank you. Ahem.

257
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,340
I remember when Barry got home
from his first date with Rachel.

258
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,133
Huh?

259
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,013
What? You hired the same band.
I can't use the same speech?

260
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,266
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

261
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,353
Anyway, I wish you both...

262
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,939
...a wonderful life together.
Aw.

263
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,148
And, Rachel.

264
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,652
- What?
- No, no, in all seriousness.

265
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,780
Not a lot of women would
have the guts to come back here.

266
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,616
And even fewer who'd do it
with their asses hanging out.

267
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,577
That's it.

268
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,335
I'd like to add something to that.

269
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,713
- What are you adding? What are you adding?
- It's okay. It's okay.

270
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,634
Most of you don't know me.
I'm Rachel's boyfriend...

271
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:10,927
Oh, dear God.

272
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,179
...Ross.

273
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,473
And I'd just like to say that...

274
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:20,228
...it did take a lot of courage
for Rachel to come here tonight.

275
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,271
And just for the record...

276
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,651
...she did not run out on Barry
because she had syphilis.

277
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,864
What are you doing? I'm serious.

278
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,242
The reason...

279
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,954
...she walked out on Barry
is simply that...

280
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,706
...she didn't love him.

281
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,584
Which, incidentally,
worked out pretty well for me. Heh, heh.

282
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,010
Cheers.

283
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,680
- See you in the parking lot.
- No, Rach.

284
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,643
And once again,
she is out of here!

285
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,354
Okay, who had 9:45? Hm?

286
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,196
Heh.

287
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,829
You know what, Bar?
I'm not gonna leave.

288
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,249
I probably should, but I'm not.

289
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,795
I promised myself I'd make it
through at least one of your weddings.

290
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,845
Tonight, all I wanted was
to make it through this evening...

291
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,308
...with a little bit of grace
and dignity.

292
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,687
Well, I guess we can all agree
that's not gonna happen.

293
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,943
I guess there's nothing
really left to say...

294
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,237
...except...

295
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,953
Her name was Lola

296
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,541
She was a showgirl

297
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,378
With yellow feath...

298
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,422
Feathers in her hair

299
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,675
And a dress cut down to there

300
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,427
She would...

301
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,887
Merengue
- Merengue

302
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,263
Thank you, honey.

303
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,016
And do the cha-cha

304
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:26,854
And while she'd like to be a star
Tony always tended bar

305
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,147
Wait, wait!

306
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,732
Everybody!

307
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,359
Copa

308
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,902
Copacabana

309
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,823
The hottest spot north of Havana

310
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,366
At the Copa

311
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,993
Copacabana

312
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:46,249
Music and passion were always
In fashion at the Copa

313
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,130
There's a somebody I'm longing...

314
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,631
Okay.

315
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,591
I'll do it.

316
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,260
You'll do what?

317
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,263
If kids is what it takes to be with you,
then kids it is.

318
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,682
Oh, my God.

319
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,393
If I have to,
I'll do it all again.

320
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,854
I'll do the 4:00 feeding thing.

321
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,981
I'll go to the PTA meetings.

322
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,108
I'll coach the soccer team.

323
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,403
- Really?
- Yeah, if I have to.

324
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,905
Monica...

325
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,702
...I don't wanna lose you.

326
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,497
So if I have to do it all again...

327
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,124
...then I will.

328
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,838
You are the most wonderful man.

329
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,758
And if you hadn't have said...

330
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,679
..."If I have to," like, 17 times...

331
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,224
...then I'd be saying, "Okay, let's do it. "

332
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,895
But you're not.

333
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:56,277
Oh, my God. I can't believe
what I'm getting ready to say.

334
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,533
I wanna have a baby.

335
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,749
But I don't want to have one with
someone who doesn't really want to have one.

336
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,628
God.

337
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,010
I love you.

338
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,767
I know you do.

339
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,938
Me too.

340
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,696
So what now?

341
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,659
I guess we just...

342
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,203
...keep dancing.

343
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:53,793
Someone to watch

344
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,379
Over me

345
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,719
Where is she? Where is she?

346
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,554
Oh, hey, I have a question.

347
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,806
Where is she?

348
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,101
Chandler. Relax, Chandler.
She'll be here.

349
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,146
Oh, oh, oh. That's her.

350
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,817
Yeah, because life's just that kind.

351
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,528
You gotta stop staring at the door...

352
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,029
...like a watched pot.

353
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,366
If you keep looking at it,
the door's never gonna boil.

354
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,662
I think what you have to do
is try not to...

355
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,044
Oh, my God.

356
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,007
Oh...

357
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,050
...my...

358
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,927
...God.

359
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,229
Oh...

360
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,439
...my...

361
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,940
...God.

362
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,533
All right.

363
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,370
I've been feeling incredibly guilty
because I wanna be a good friend.

364
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,458
And damn it, I am a good friend.
So shut up and close your eyes.

365
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,379
Wow.

366
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,591
You are a good friend.

367
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,177
The audition was this morning,
and I didn't get it.

368
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,514
But that was a hell of a kiss.

369
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,808
Rachel is a very lucky girl.
