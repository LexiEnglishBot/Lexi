1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,061
Mom, would you relax?

2
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:08,171
That was 10 blocks from here, and any
women won't walking alone at night.

3
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:09,999
I would never do that.

4
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,843
Mom, come on, stop worrying.

5
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:16,378
This is a safe street. This is
a safe building. There's nothing

6
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:19,585
Oh, my God! What are
you doing in here?!

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,582
Mom, I gotta go! IT gotta go!

8
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:25,925
Oh, my God!

9
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,352
That's fine, you just read the paper.

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,030
I'm gonna get a pot.

11
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,330
It's not for you.

12
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,038
Okay, that's fine.

13
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,001
Read the Family Circus...

14
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,544
...enjoy the gentle comedy...

15
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:56,186
Oh, my God, my God, my God, my God...

16
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,893
It's open, you guys.

17
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,402
Can I help you?

18
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,697
Does Phoebe still live here?

19
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,272
No, she doesn't. But I can get
a message to her.

20
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,410
Great. Just tell her
her husband stopped by.

21
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,079
Her what?

22
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,040
How did you do that?

23
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:32,090
The One With Phoebe's Husband

24
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,567
This is unbelievable, Pheebs.
How can you be married?

25
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,636
I'm not "married"
married, you know?

26
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,533
He's just a friend, and he's gay...

27
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,404
...and he was from Canada,
and he needed a Green Card.

28
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,670
I can't believe you married Duncan!

29
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:32,578
How could you not tell me?
We told each other everything.

30
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,448
I'm sorry, but I knew if I told you,
you'd get judgmental...

31
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:37,621
...and wouldn't approve.

32
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,791
Of course I wouldn't approve!

33
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:43,119
You were totally in love
with this guy who, hello, was gay.

34
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,126
What the hell were you thinking?

35
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,163
See? And you thought
she'd be judgmental.

36
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:52,696
I wasn't in love with him.
I was helping out a friend.

37
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:56,271
When he left town, you
stayed in your pajamas for a month.

38
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,443
And I saw you eat a cheeseburger.

39
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,207
Well, didn't you?

40
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,808
I might have.

41
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,017
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

42
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:10,688
Like you tell me everything?

43
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,892
What have I not told you?

44
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,758
I don't know.

45
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:18,929
The fact that the underwear out
on the telephone pole is yours...

46
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,756
...from when you had sex
with Bobby on the terrace!

47
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,127
What?

48
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,228
Wait a minute! Who told you?

49
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,471
You are dead meat.

50
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,345
I didn't know it was a big secret.

51
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,682
Oh, it's not big. Not at all.

52
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,350
IKind of the same as, say...

53
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,050
...I don't know, having
a third nipple!

54
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,380
You have a third nipple?

55
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,294
You bitch!

56
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,128
Whip it out! Whip it out!

57
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,602
There's nothing to see! It's a
tiny bump. It's totally useless.

58
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,102
As opposed to your other
multi-functional nipples?

59
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,704
I can't believe you!
You told me it was a nubbin.

60
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,473
Joey, what did you think
a nubbin was?

61
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:15,380
You see something, you hear a word,
I thought that's what it was.

62
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,982
- Let me see it again!
- Yes, show us your nubbin!

63
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,891
Joey was in a porno movie!

64
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:27,525
If I'm going down,
I'm taking everybody with me!

65
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,061
- Oh, my God!
- You were in a porno?!

66
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,231
I was young and I just wanted a job.

67
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,539
But I couldn't go through with it.

68
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,877
They let me be the guy who fixes
the copier but can't...

69
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,775
...because there's people
having sex on it.

70
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,577
That is wild!

71
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,077
- What's it shaped like?
- Is it hairy?

72
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,287
What happens if you flick it?

73
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:02,334
So does it do anything,
you know, special?

74
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:05,963
Pressing my third nipple
opens the delivery entrance...

75
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,400
...to the magical land of Narnia.

76
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:14,104
In some cultures, having a third nipple
is actually a sign of virility.

77
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:17,043
You get the best huts,
and women dance naked around you.

78
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:21,714
Are any of these cultures,
per chance, in the Tri-State area?

79
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:26,915
You know, you are so amazing.
Is there anything you don't know?

80
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:32,325
Julie's so smart!
Julie's so special!

81
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:40,062
I wanted you to hook up
with Ross as much as you did.

82
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,741
But he's with her now.
You'll have to get over it.

83
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:46,705
Oh, I'm going to have to get over it.

84
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,471
I didn't know that's what I had to do.
I just have to get over it.

85
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,026
- Sassy lady!
- Where are you going?

86
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,689
I'm meeting Duncan.
He's skating tonight at the Garden.

87
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,862
He's in the Capades.

88
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,166
- The Ice Capades?
- No, the Gravel Capades.

89
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:16,864
The turns aren't as fast,
but when Snoopy falls? Funny.

90
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,238
I can't believe
you'd dress up for him.

91
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,743
You're setting yourself up
all over again.

92
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,742
Okay, no.

93
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:29,288
For your information, I'm seeing him
so I can put those feelings behind me.

94
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:33,358
The reason I'm dressed like this
is because I think it's nice...

95
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:36,060
...to look nice for your gay husband.

96
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,194
Darn it, we're all out of milk.

97
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,593
Chandler, will you fill me up here?

98
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:53,408
I see, I see. Because of
the third-nipple thing.

99
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,951
Okay, sweetie, I'll see you later.

100
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:07,315
- See you later, Rach.
- Bye-bye, Julie.

101
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,898
Come on, cut it out!

102
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,410
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

103
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,511
What?

104
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,609
Come on, talk to me.

105
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,653
What's the longest you've been
in a relationship before...

106
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,923
...having the sex?

107
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,731
Why? Who's not?
Are you and Julie not?

108
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,934
Are you and Julie not having sex?

109
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,036
Technically?

110
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:54,604
No.

111
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,941
Is it because she's so cold in bed?

112
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:05,114
Or because she's kind of bossy,
makes it feel like school?

113
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:10,121
No! She's great. And it's not
like we haven't done anything.

114
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,726
We do plenty of other stuff.
Lots of other stuff like

115
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,622
No! Don't need to know the details.

116
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,964
No, it's just...

117
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,967
It's me.

118
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:26,171
I've only been with
one woman my whole life...

119
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,498
...and she turned out to be a lesbian.

120
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:33,477
So now I've got myself
all psyched out.

121
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,244
It's become, like, this...

122
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,075
...this thing!

123
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,784
You must just think I'm weird.

124
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,856
No, I don't think it's weird.

125
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,527
I think, in fact...

126
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,229
- In fact, you know what I think?
- What?

127
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,727
I think it's sexy.

128
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,233
Sexy?

129
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,562
Let me tell you something.
As a woman...

130
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,875
...there is nothing sexier...

131
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,645
...than a man who does not
want to have sex.

132
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:08,780
No kidding?

133
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,413
You know what I'd do?

134
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,047
I'd wait.

135
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,855
- You'd wait?
- Absolutely. I would wait...

136
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,190
...and wait...

137
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,853
Then I'd wait some more.

138
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,321
Really?

139
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:29,625
I don't care if she tells you
she wants it, she begs, she pleads...

140
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:33,599
...she tells you she's gonna
have sex with another man

141
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,430
That just means it's working.

142
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,108
Women really want this?

143
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,109
More than jewelry.

144
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,066
Look at you! You look great!

145
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,533
Do I? Thank you.

146
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,605
So do you. Sparkly!

147
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:22,254
This is pretty wonderful,
Mr. Major Capades Guy!

148
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:28,185
I remember when you were just
King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice Is Nice.

149
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,490
You always said I'd make it.

150
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,664
Well, you know,
I'm kind of spooky that way.

151
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:37,964
Gosh, I missed you!

152
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,575
- I'm gonna get changed.
- Okay.

153
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:47,511
Now.

154
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,374
Oh! Right. Okay.

155
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,015
Ole!

156
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:55,654
What?

157
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,656
The Matador...

158
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,023
Ole!

159
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,634
Sweetie, can you
hold this for a second?

160
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,881
Sorry, you had a
paleontologist on your face.

161
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,846
But it's gone now.
You're all right.

162
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,679
Hi, everyone.

163
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,990
I wanted to thank you
for our little talk before.

164
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:39,664
No problem! So you're gonna
go with the waiting thing?

165
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,366
I was going to, but after
I talked to you, I talked to Joey.

166
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,038
Good. What did he say?

167
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,937
He told me to get over myself
and just do it.

168
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,680
I thought about what you said
and about what he said.

169
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,147
And his way, I get
to have sex tonight, so...

170
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,392
What is this in my pocket?

171
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,223
Why, it's Joey's porno movie!

172
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,025
Pop it in!

173
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,301
I'm fine, if you're
okay watching a video...

174
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,803
...filled with two-nippled people.

175
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,042
People having sex.
That's just what I need to see.

176
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,416
What's wrong with people having sex?

177
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,814
Well, you know, these
movies are offensive...

178
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:43,459
...and degrading
to women and females...

179
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:48,730
And the lighting's
always unflattering.

180
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,730
- Monica, help me out here.
- Hell, I wanna see Joey!

181
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:05,673
So is there a story?
Or do they just start doing it right

182
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,782
Oh. Never mind.

183
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,681
Wait a minute. That is the craziest
typing test I've ever seen.

184
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,824
All I say is, she'd
better get the job.

185
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:19,097
Looks to me like he's
the one getting the job.

186
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,697
Here I come.

187
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,663
See, I'm coming to fix the copier.

188
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:28,666
I can't get to the copier.
I'm thinking, "What do I do?"

189
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,841
So I just watch them have sex.

190
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,781
Then I say Here's my line!

191
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,584
You know, that's bad
for the paper tray.

192
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,555
Nice work, my friend!

193
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,658
Wait, you see me again. Hang on,
the guy's butt's blocking me.

194
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:53,657
There I am. There I am.
There I am...

195
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,975
So what's up?
You came to see me yesterday.

196
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,108
I kind of need a divorce.

197
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:13,677
O...

198
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,346
...kay.

199
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:16,886
How come?

200
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,852
Actually, I'm getting married again.

201
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,319
What?

202
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,529
I don't know how to tell you this.

203
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,489
I'm straight.

204
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,937
I don't understand.
How can you be straight?

205
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,574
You're so smart and funny...

206
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,678
...and you throw
such great Academy Award parties!

207
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,212
That's what I kept telling myself.

208
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,917
But you reach a point
where you can't live a lie anymore.

209
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,449
How long have you known?

210
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:56,593
I guess on some level
I always knew I was straight.

211
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,621
I thought I was supposed
to be something else.

212
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:04,596
I'm an ice dancer, all my friends
are gay. I was just trying to fit in.

213
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,569
And there's actually a woman?

214
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,607
Her name's Debra.

215
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:19,182
Well, is she the first
that you've been with?

216
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,921
I've never told you this...

217
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:28,355
...but there were one
or two times back in college when...

218
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,585
...I'd get drunk,
go to a straight bar...

219
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,387
...and wake up with
a woman next to me.

220
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:38,570
I told myself it was the liquor,
and everyone experiments in college.

221
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,072
Sure.

222
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,106
Now I know I don't have a choice.
I was born this way!

223
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,881
I don't know what to say.

224
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,881
You're married to someone for
six years and you think you know him.

225
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,985
And then one day he says,
"Oh, I'm not gay!"

226
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,556
I'm still me.

227
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,124
Why couldn't you just have
figured this out six years ago?

228
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,331
You know, it still
smells like monkey in there.

229
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,936
That saves us the conversation.

230
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,543
This has been great,
but I'm officially wiped.

231
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,945
Me too. We should get going.

232
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,788
No! Come on, you guys!

233
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,485
Come on, it's only 11:30.

234
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,820
Let's just talk. We never just
hang out and talk anymore.

235
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,632
Rachel, that's all we do.

236
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,963
Maybe that's all we do.
What about Julie?

237
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,863
What about Julie?

238
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:53,141
You have been in our lives
for nearly two months now...

239
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,644
...and we don't really know you.

240
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,381
I mean, who is Julie?

241
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,976
What do you like?
What don't you like?

242
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,414
We want to know everything.

243
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,687
Well, that could take awhile.

244
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,417
So?

245
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:12,461
Who here does not have
the time to get to know Julie?

246
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,097
I got the time to get to know Julie.

247
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,394
I know her pretty well.
Can I go?

248
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,568
That's fine.

249
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,471
Let's start with your childhood.
What was that like?

250
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:29,779
In a nutshell

251
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,014
So, have you told your parents?

252
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:40,524
No, but it'll be okay.
They're pretty cool.

253
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,091
My brother's straight, so...

254
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,027
Here you go.

255
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,823
You know what?
I just have one more question.

256
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:54,204
If you had figured this out sooner,
and I had been around...

257
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,168
...do you think I
would have been the one...?

258
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,204
No. Don't tell me.

259
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:04,414
I don't think either answer
would make me feel better. Here.

260
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,544
I love you, Phoebe.

261
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,300
So your brother's straight, huh?

262
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,963
Seriously.

263
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:34,910
And my second-grade teacher
was Miss Thomas...

264
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,672
...and my first-grade teacher
was Mrs. Cobb.

265
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,051
Mrs. Gobb?

266
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,912
No, Cobb. Like cobb salad.

267
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,183
What exactly is in a cobb salad?

268
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:49,825
I'm going home.

269
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,328
Boy, that Julie's a talker, huh?

270
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:00,732
Good night.

271
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,402
It's pretty late. You're
probably not still planning on...

272
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,879
No, I am.

273
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,347
Are you nervous?

274
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,652
I have done it before.

275
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,456
I mean, how are
you gonna handle it?

276
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:25,720
Are you gonna talk about it beforehand?
Are you just gonna pounce?

277
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,260
I don't know. I guess
I'm just gonna...

278
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,232
...see what happens.

279
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,370
Good luck!

280
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,842
What?

281
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,741
Nothing...

282
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:46,817
It is your first time with her, and
if the first time doesn't go well...

283
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:50,983
...well then, that's pretty darn
hard to recover from.

284
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,126
Okay, now I'm nervous.

285
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,253
Maybe you should put it off.

286
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,262
No, I don't want to put it off!

287
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,936
I spent last year being
so unbelievably miserable.

288
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:13,075
And now I'm actually happy.

289
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,014
You know, I mean really happy.

290
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,311
I just don't wanna...

291
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,614
I don't wanna mess it up, you know?

292
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,950
I know.

293
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,527
I'm sorry.

294
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,820
It's not your fault.

295
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,287
Right.

296
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:39,096
Maybe it doesn't
have to be this tough.

297
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:44,708
Maybe you were on the right track
with that whole "spontaneous" thing.

298
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,145
- Women really like that.
- Really?

299
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:54,382
I mean if it were me,
I'd want you to...

300
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:58,753
I don't know, catch me off guard
with a really...

301
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:00,788
...good kiss.

302
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,463
Really sort of soft at first.

303
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:13,570
And then maybe brush
the hair away from my face.

304
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:18,133
And then look far into my eyes...

305
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,037
...in a way that lets me
know something...

306
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,542
...amazing is about to happen.

307
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,090
And then, I don't know, then...

308
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:36,260
...you'd pull me
really close to you so that...

309
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:39,953
...so that I'd be pressed up
right against you.

310
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,594
And it would get kind of...

311
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,929
...sweaty...

312
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,706
...and blurry.

313
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,941
And then it's just happening.

314
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,817
Thanks, Rach. Good night!

315
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,889
Oh, God!

316
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,644
Good morning!

317
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,749
Well, somebody got some last night!

318
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,086
Twice!
