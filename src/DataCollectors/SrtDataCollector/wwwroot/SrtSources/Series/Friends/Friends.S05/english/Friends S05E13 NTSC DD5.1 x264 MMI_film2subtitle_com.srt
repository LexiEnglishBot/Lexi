1
00:00:03,315 --> 00:00:07,376
l can't believe we've never
done this. lt's so good!

2
00:00:07,586 --> 00:00:10,077
lt's so good for Monica.

3
00:00:13,392 --> 00:00:14,757
Time's up! My turn.

4
00:00:16,962 --> 00:00:19,328
-That was half an hour?
-lt's your timer.

5
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:27,230
l don't like to brag about it,
but l give the best massages.

6
00:00:27,472 --> 00:00:30,305
All right, then massage me up
right nice!

7
00:00:35,514 --> 00:00:36,947
lt's so good, isn't it?

8
00:00:37,182 --> 00:00:39,412
l don't know what
l did to deserve it.

9
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,180
Now stop trying to add more time
to your massage.

10
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:48,620
Say goodbye to sore muscles!

11
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:50,827
Goodbye, muscles!

12
00:00:52,264 --> 00:00:54,494
The One with Joey's Bag

13
00:01:39,778 --> 00:01:42,269
She gives the worst massages ever!

14
00:01:43,548 --> 00:01:46,779
lt was like she was torturing me
for information.

15
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:50,652
l wanted to give it up.
l just didn't know what it was!

16
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:54,453
lf it hurts that bad,
you should tell her.

17
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,456
For the first time,
l'm in a real relationship.

18
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:00,892
l won't screw that up
by telling the truth.

19
00:02:03,068 --> 00:02:04,501
Dude, look out!

20
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,397
You almost crushed my hat.

21
00:02:07,172 --> 00:02:08,264
Sorry.

22
00:02:09,174 --> 00:02:11,165
And the bunny got away.

23
00:02:19,384 --> 00:02:22,751
This would be the place
where you explain the hat.

24
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:30,254
This is called a top hat.

25
00:02:32,597 --> 00:02:37,091
And why are you wearing this--?
ls it ''top hat''?

26
00:02:39,838 --> 00:02:41,328
There's this play...

27
00:02:41,606 --> 00:02:45,508
...and l'm up for the part of this
cool, suave, international guy.

28
00:02:45,777 --> 00:02:47,608
A clotheshorse. So l figure...

29
00:02:47,846 --> 00:02:52,374
...everyone at the audition will
wear ultra-hip, high-fashion stuff.

30
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:54,380
And you'll make them disappear?

31
00:02:55,654 --> 00:02:58,851
Like you could find something
this sophisticated.

32
00:03:00,525 --> 00:03:01,719
Done!

33
00:03:02,994 --> 00:03:07,226
lf you want to look good,
come to the store. l'll help you.

34
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:08,897
-Thanks!
-Sure.

35
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:10,691
Please, take those off!

36
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:16,164
Hey, Pheebs. How's it going?

37
00:03:16,808 --> 00:03:20,209
Only okay because l just
got back from the hospital.

38
00:03:20,812 --> 00:03:22,245
Are you all right?

39
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:25,473
l'm fine,
but my grandma sort of died.

40
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:28,007
Pheebs, sorry.

41
00:03:28,186 --> 00:03:29,175
lt's okay.

42
00:03:29,421 --> 00:03:31,389
She had a really incredible life.

43
00:03:31,656 --> 00:03:34,648
lt's not like l won't see her again.
She'll visit.

44
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:39,890
Maybe she's with us right now.

45
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:45,034
Right. She's on a new spiritual plain
and she'll come to the coffeehouse.

46
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,728
l just saw two people having sex
in a car right outside!

47
00:03:51,676 --> 00:03:54,167
Pheebs' grandmother just died.

48
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:57,677
Oh, my God! l'm so sorry.

49
00:03:58,116 --> 00:04:01,210
Actually, it's kind of cool.
Because it's like...

50
00:04:01,553 --> 00:04:04,283
...you know, one life ends
and another begins.

51
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:08,288
Not the way they're doing it.

52
00:04:10,195 --> 00:04:12,857
What happened?
How did she die?

53
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:14,224
We were in the market...

54
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:19,096
...and she bent down to get some yogurt
and never came back up again.

55
00:04:20,372 --> 00:04:21,703
l'm so sorry.

56
00:04:21,907 --> 00:04:23,807
The last thing she said was:

57
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:28,979
''You get the eggs, l'll get the yogurt,
and we'll meet at the checkout counter.''

58
00:04:29,581 --> 00:04:30,639
You know what?

59
00:04:31,082 --> 00:04:33,482
We will meet at the checkout counter.

60
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:44,094
Since you're returning
all this stuff...

61
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:46,422
...you'll have to wear underwear.

62
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:50,397
All right.
You'd better show me that too.

63
00:04:52,003 --> 00:04:54,164
lt's missing something.

64
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:03,576
Really? A purse?

65
00:05:03,782 --> 00:05:06,649
lt's not a purse.
lt's a shoulder bag.

66
00:05:07,352 --> 00:05:09,343
lt looks like a woman's purse.

67
00:05:10,088 --> 00:05:14,149
Trust me, all the men are carrying
them in the spring catalog.

68
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:17,088
See, look.
Men carrying the bag.

69
00:05:17,963 --> 00:05:20,625
See, look.
Women carrying the bag.

70
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:33,137
But it is odd how a woman's purse
looks so good on me, a man.

71
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:36,638
Exactly. Unisex!

72
00:05:36,948 --> 00:05:40,008
Maybe you need sex.
l had sex a couple days ago.

73
00:05:41,553 --> 00:05:45,148
No, Joey. U-N-l sex.

74
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:49,191
l ain't gonna say no to that!

75
00:05:57,836 --> 00:05:59,463
-Who is it?
-lt's Phoebe.

76
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:01,137
Oh, great!

77
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:03,804
Oh, you.

78
00:06:04,576 --> 00:06:05,804
What's up?

79
00:06:07,812 --> 00:06:11,373
Well, l sort of have some bad news.
Can l come in?

80
00:06:12,851 --> 00:06:13,875
No, thanks.

81
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:21,320
Grandma died today.

82
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,920
Didn't she die like five years ago?

83
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,596
No, she just died today.

84
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,267
We're having
a memorial service tomorrow.

85
00:06:31,503 --> 00:06:34,233
Okay, l know l went to that already.

86
00:06:34,506 --> 00:06:35,939
No, you didn't!

87
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:37,731
Then who's been dead?

88
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:39,169
Lots of people!

89
00:06:41,746 --> 00:06:43,771
Look, are you coming or not?

90
00:06:47,686 --> 00:06:50,849
l thought she was dead,
so l've made my peace.

91
00:06:52,524 --> 00:06:54,287
Plus l'm going to a concert.

92
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:58,051
l'd invite you,
but l only have two tickets left.

93
00:06:59,698 --> 00:07:04,067
-Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
-Thanks. Enjoy your funeral!

94
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,713
You look just like your son,
Mrs. Tribbiani.

95
00:07:20,118 --> 00:07:22,951
What? Are you referring
to my man's bag?

96
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:27,888
l thought it just looked good,
but it's practical too.

97
00:07:28,326 --> 00:07:32,285
lt's got compartments for your
wallet, keys, address book....

98
00:07:32,464 --> 00:07:33,453
Your makeup.

99
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,325
What are you doing?
The audition's tomorrow.

100
00:07:38,603 --> 00:07:41,128
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.

101
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:44,570
You get mustard on that bag,
you can't return it.

102
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:47,607
Why would l return this?
l love this bag!

103
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:51,145
-All right, then you owe me $350.
-Fine.

104
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:54,641
Do you take Vasa or Mooster Card?

105
00:07:56,955 --> 00:08:02,086
Relax, l'll pay you with the money
from the job l'll get. Thanks to you.

106
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:04,989
What's the part? Auntie Mame?

107
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:07,829
Don't listen to them.
l think it's sexy.

108
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,363
You-and-l sexy?

109
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:20,501
Hello, Mrs. Pinilla.
Thank you for coming.

110
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:22,770
Here's your 3-D glasses.

111
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:28,111
Reverend Pong will say
when to put them on.

112
00:08:31,823 --> 00:08:33,120
Hi, sweetie.

113
00:08:33,324 --> 00:08:35,315
-How are you holding up?
-Fine.

114
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:38,127
Hey, Pheebs. l'm so sorry.

115
00:08:39,964 --> 00:08:43,365
You know what?
My grandma had the exact same bag!

116
00:08:44,302 --> 00:08:45,496
l brought you flowers.

117
00:08:45,737 --> 00:08:47,227
Oh, thanks!

118
00:08:47,505 --> 00:08:50,406
Pulling flowers out
makes the bag look masculine.

119
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:55,741
Excuse me, is this the memorial?

120
00:08:56,014 --> 00:08:57,504
Welcome.

121
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,383
Here's your 3-D glasses.

122
00:08:59,884 --> 00:09:01,317
All right.

123
00:09:03,154 --> 00:09:05,315
So how did you know Frances?

124
00:09:05,523 --> 00:09:08,083
Actually, l hadn't seen her for years.

125
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:13,090
But l was pretty tight
with her and her daughter.

126
00:09:13,364 --> 00:09:14,524
What's your name?

127
00:09:14,766 --> 00:09:16,427
Frank Buffay.

128
00:09:19,204 --> 00:09:22,833
You know what? Strike that.
My name, actually, is Joe.

129
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:25,732
Joe Hill.

130
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,899
You're Frank Buf--

131
00:09:27,212 --> 00:09:29,510
No! Joe Hill.

132
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:31,838
You just said--

133
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,881
l got to go.
Thank you so much for coming.

134
00:09:38,923 --> 00:09:40,220
Oh, my God!

135
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:41,584
What happened?

136
00:09:42,026 --> 00:09:43,186
That was my dad.

137
00:09:44,896 --> 00:09:46,022
Check it out!

138
00:09:47,031 --> 00:09:49,022
lt's like it's coming right at me.

139
00:09:58,443 --> 00:10:00,707
-Did you catch him?
-What did he say?

140
00:10:00,945 --> 00:10:04,142
He said, ''Nice to meet you, Glenda.''

141
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,543
l couldn't give him my real name.

142
00:10:07,785 --> 00:10:08,877
Why not?

143
00:10:09,154 --> 00:10:10,587
You saw the way he ran.

144
00:10:10,788 --> 00:10:13,586
You think he'd talk
to the daughter he abandoned?

145
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:15,554
What did you say to him?

146
00:10:15,793 --> 00:10:19,991
l said l was the executor of the will
and l needed to talk to him.

147
00:10:20,265 --> 00:10:23,098
l'm going to meet him
at the coffeehouse.

148
00:10:23,301 --> 00:10:24,996
Could everyone take their seats?

149
00:10:25,436 --> 00:10:27,927
l just can't think about that now.

150
00:10:28,306 --> 00:10:30,604
l want to say goodbye to my grandma.

151
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:32,671
Let's go say goodbye.

152
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:48,358
l'm off to my audition.
How do l look?

153
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:52,321
Great!
That bag will get you that part.

154
00:10:52,597 --> 00:10:54,189
And a date with a man.

155
00:10:56,167 --> 00:11:00,263
You know what? Make fun all you want.
This is a great bag.

156
00:11:00,505 --> 00:11:03,167
And it's as handy as it is becoming.

157
00:11:03,474 --> 00:11:07,535
Just because you don't understand
something, doesn't make it wrong.

158
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:10,947
You guys have to get used
to the fact that Joey...

159
00:11:11,683 --> 00:11:13,446
...comes with a bag!

160
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,311
l've got to meet my dad.

161
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:19,316
Will you tell him who you are?

162
00:11:19,557 --> 00:11:22,151
Not at first.
l don't want to freak him out.

163
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,294
But aren't you pissed at him?

164
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:26,497
This guy abandoned you.

165
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:30,998
lf it were me, this guy would be
in some serious physical danger.

166
00:11:31,236 --> 00:11:35,969
l'd walk in there,
l'd be like, ''Yo, Dad!

167
00:11:36,207 --> 00:11:39,404
You and me, outside.
Right now!''

168
00:11:40,511 --> 00:11:42,206
l kind of scared myself.

169
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:45,474
Well, at least you scared someone.

170
00:11:47,385 --> 00:11:49,319
You'd think l'd be angry.

171
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,650
You'd think l'd want to rip
his tiny, little head off!

172
00:11:54,425 --> 00:11:56,757
Fortunately, l'm past it.

173
00:11:57,228 --> 00:12:00,925
You do seem a little tense.
Here, let me help you.

174
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:02,255
Get off!

175
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:06,426
Stop it!
Why are you doing that to me?

176
00:12:07,238 --> 00:12:08,432
What are you talking about?

177
00:12:08,706 --> 00:12:11,504
As a masseuse and a human...

178
00:12:11,843 --> 00:12:15,176
...l'm begging you,
never do that to anyone!

179
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:17,841
l give good massages.

180
00:12:20,585 --> 00:12:23,213
l gave them to Rachel
before she got allergic.

181
00:12:25,923 --> 00:12:28,619
And Chandler, he loves them!
Watch.

182
00:12:30,428 --> 00:12:32,760
He does not like it.
He's in pain!

183
00:12:33,031 --> 00:12:35,727
-No, he's not.
-Yes, he is!

184
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,692
-What?
-l'm sorry, but--

185
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:45,539
You've been lying to me?

186
00:12:45,877 --> 00:12:47,469
l can't believe that.

187
00:12:47,745 --> 00:12:49,736
Maybe he didn't want to hurt you.

188
00:12:49,981 --> 00:12:53,246
But the minute we start
to lie to each other....

189
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:57,610
And by ''we'' ...

190
00:12:58,289 --> 00:12:59,984
...l mean society.

191
00:13:02,794 --> 00:13:05,126
Anytime you're ready.

192
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,889
Well, you must be new here.

193
00:13:08,132 --> 00:13:10,430
Maybe we get a table,
l buy you a drink.

194
00:13:10,735 --> 00:13:12,930
Could you try it without the purse?

195
00:13:15,006 --> 00:13:16,633
Yeah, sure.

196
00:13:20,445 --> 00:13:24,245
Well, you must be new here.
Maybe we sit--

197
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:26,273
Can l ask you something?

198
00:13:26,484 --> 00:13:27,473
Sure. What?

199
00:13:27,752 --> 00:13:30,277
Well, first,
it's not a purse.

200
00:13:32,323 --> 00:13:33,347
Anytime.

201
00:13:33,624 --> 00:13:36,024
lf you think
it's a woman's bag, it's not.

202
00:13:36,294 --> 00:13:38,194
lt's a man's bag.

203
00:13:39,097 --> 00:13:41,657
Okay. And go!

204
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,360
Let me show you the catalog.

205
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:47,129
Look. See?

206
00:13:48,706 --> 00:13:50,139
lt's the latest thing.

207
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,208
Everyone's got one.
Men, women, children.

208
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:54,808
Do you sell these?

209
00:13:57,482 --> 00:14:00,178
No, these babies sell themselves.

210
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:03,118
Thank you.
That was great.

211
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:05,145
But l didn't read anything.

212
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,517
l think we've seen enough.

213
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,850
All right, l'll see you.

214
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:12,892
We got it. We got it.

215
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,524
ls Rachel here?

216
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:22,836
Listen, l just wanted to apologize
about the whole massage thing.

217
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:25,565
l really like them.

218
00:14:26,344 --> 00:14:28,335
Please, stop!

219
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,580
We're supposed to be honest.

220
00:14:31,983 --> 00:14:35,510
l wish you could tell me,
''l don't like your massages.''

221
00:14:40,224 --> 00:14:42,715
l don't like your massages.

222
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:47,263
See? lt's no big deal.

223
00:14:48,433 --> 00:14:50,264
But now you're crying!

224
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:54,665
l'm not crying about that.
l'm crying about something at work.

225
00:14:55,873 --> 00:14:59,001
My boyfriend said
he didn't like my massages.

226
00:14:59,777 --> 00:15:02,245
You don't have
to be best at everything.

227
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:06,110
Oh, my God!
You don't know me at all!

228
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,888
You give the worst massages
in the world.

229
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,181
l'm crying here!

230
00:15:14,892 --> 00:15:16,086
Look, hear me out.

231
00:15:16,294 --> 00:15:19,627
You give the best bad-massages.

232
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:23,591
lf anybody was looking
for the best bad-massage...

233
00:15:23,868 --> 00:15:26,132
...and they thought,
''Who's the best?''

234
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,803
They'd have to go to you.

235
00:15:33,978 --> 00:15:37,209
So you're saying that
if there was an award...

236
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:41,976
...for the best bad-massage....
Who would get that?

237
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:43,880
lt would be you!

238
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:47,249
You, Monica!
And you'd get all the votes.

239
00:15:48,426 --> 00:15:50,826
So they could call the award,
''The Monica''?

240
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:54,258
Absolutely.

241
00:15:57,602 --> 00:15:59,069
l suck!

242
00:16:05,977 --> 00:16:07,604
Thank you for meeting me.

243
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:09,244
Thank you.

244
00:16:09,914 --> 00:16:11,347
Come sit.

245
00:16:13,618 --> 00:16:14,915
Sit.

246
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:16,786
Sit!

247
00:16:18,756 --> 00:16:21,657
Alrighty.
Before we get started, l need you...

248
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:26,023
...to state for the record
that you are, in fact, Frank Buffay.

249
00:16:26,297 --> 00:16:28,265
Yes, l am.

250
00:16:31,369 --> 00:16:32,961
What did Frances leave me?

251
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:35,968
That's why you wanted me to come.

252
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,541
Yes, she did. She left you...

253
00:16:42,113 --> 00:16:43,944
...this lipstick.

254
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,985
lt's used.

255
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:54,722
Cool!

256
00:16:57,495 --> 00:17:02,558
l have just a few questions to ask,
so l'll get out my official forms.

257
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:08,004
So question one:

258
00:17:08,706 --> 00:17:12,540
You were married to Frances'
daughter, Lilly. Correct?

259
00:17:12,743 --> 00:17:14,734
Yes, l was.

260
00:17:15,713 --> 00:17:18,341
Question two.
Did that marriage end:

261
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,175
A: Happily?

262
00:17:20,484 --> 00:17:22,714
B: Medium?

263
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,148
Or C: ln the total abandonment...

264
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,415
...of her and her two children?

265
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:30,521
lt really says that?

266
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:31,853
Yeah, see?

267
00:17:33,898 --> 00:17:36,264
l guess then l would have to say C.

268
00:17:37,902 --> 00:17:39,563
Total abandonment.

269
00:17:41,072 --> 00:17:42,767
Reasons for abandonment:

270
00:17:43,174 --> 00:17:46,405
A: Top-secret government work.

271
00:17:47,011 --> 00:17:48,103
B: Amnesia.

272
00:17:48,379 --> 00:17:51,678
Or C: You're just a selfish,
irresponsible...

273
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,350
...bad, bad man.

274
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:57,285
l don't want the lipstick that much.

275
00:17:59,056 --> 00:18:02,355
Would you do me a favor?

276
00:18:02,593 --> 00:18:04,288
Would you give Lilly...

277
00:18:05,262 --> 00:18:06,422
...that, please?

278
00:18:07,398 --> 00:18:09,628
When you see Lilly,
give her that note.

279
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:12,267
l wanted to talk to her
at the memorial...

280
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:17,537
...but l pictured her getting mad
the way you did, and l chickened out.

281
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:20,743
l wrote her a note.
Give it to her, please?

282
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:23,606
But you came to see Lilly?

283
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:25,707
Yeah. Why?

284
00:18:26,784 --> 00:18:28,581
Lilly's dead.

285
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:31,247
She what?

286
00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:32,645
She's dead.

287
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,279
Are you sure?

288
00:18:34,592 --> 00:18:37,652
lf she isn't, cremating her
was a big mistake.

289
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,928
l can't believe this.
l just can't believe--

290
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:44,929
How--?
Oh, my God.

291
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:46,759
How long ago?

292
00:18:47,104 --> 00:18:48,571
1 7 years ago.

293
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:53,343
What about the girls?

294
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,148
Well, Ursula is a waitress
and she lives in Soho.

295
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:03,816
And Phoebe...

296
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:07,420
...is on this couch.

297
00:19:15,032 --> 00:19:18,798
Yep, lipstick and a daughter.
Big day for you!

298
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:23,039
Phoebe, l....

299
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:28,672
lt's just, l don't know what to say.

300
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:34,814
l just can't believe that you're
my daughter. You're so pretty.

301
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,848
Yes, well, that's neither
here nor there.

302
00:19:41,158 --> 00:19:43,956
Would it make you feel
better if l said...

303
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:47,824
...that l was very, very sorry l left?

304
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:53,364
lt doesn't matter what you say.
lt won't make a difference.

305
00:19:53,637 --> 00:19:55,127
So you can just go.

306
00:19:56,907 --> 00:20:01,867
Well, you know, in my defense,
l was a lousy father.

307
00:20:02,313 --> 00:20:04,838
-That's your defense?
-Yes, it is.

308
00:20:05,082 --> 00:20:09,075
l burned the formula,
and l put your diapers on backwards.

309
00:20:09,353 --> 00:20:13,915
l made up a song to sing to you,
but that made you cry even more.

310
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:15,985
You make up songs?

311
00:20:16,227 --> 00:20:19,355
Well, no, just that one.
But it was stupid.

312
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:22,396
Let's see, how did it go?

313
00:20:23,768 --> 00:20:26,760
<i>Sleepy girl, sleepy girl</i>

314
00:20:27,404 --> 00:20:30,202
<i>Why won't you go to sleep?</i>

315
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:33,503
<i>Sleepy girl, sleepy girl</i>

316
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:35,905
<i>You're keeping me up</i>

317
00:20:54,932 --> 00:20:56,900
l'm not very good at this.

318
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,435
Well, l am.

319
00:21:07,111 --> 00:21:08,100
Not yet. No.

320
00:21:14,151 --> 00:21:15,277
How'd the audition go?

321
00:21:15,653 --> 00:21:17,086
Estelle said l didn't get it.

322
00:21:17,354 --> 00:21:20,585
What? Why?
Joey, you were so ready for it.

323
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:22,156
l thought so too...

324
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:25,020
...but the casting people
had problems with me.

325
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:26,490
What kind of problem?

326
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:29,356
To tell you the truth...

327
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:31,863
...they had a problem with the bag!

328
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,964
You know what?
lt was a stupid play anyway.

329
00:21:36,874 --> 00:21:38,637
lt's time to give up the bag.

330
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:41,475
l don't want to give up the bag.

331
00:21:41,946 --> 00:21:44,437
l don't have to give it up.
Do l, Rach?

332
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:50,286
You think l should give up the bag!

333
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:54,990
Joey, l'm sorry. As terrific
as l think you are with it...

334
00:21:57,127 --> 00:22:01,894
...l just don't know if the world
is ready for you and your bag.

335
00:22:04,368 --> 00:22:05,960
l can't believe this!

336
00:22:06,203 --> 00:22:09,400
Wait, l'm not saying
you shouldn't have a bag.

337
00:22:10,674 --> 00:22:14,838
There are other bags
that are maybe a little less...

338
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:17,069
...controversial.

339
00:22:18,148 --> 00:22:20,810
Yeah, they're called wallets.

340
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:25,350
You're right. You're right.

341
00:22:25,522 --> 00:22:27,922
This bag has become like a part of me.

342
00:22:28,092 --> 00:22:31,152
lt's like...my bag.

343
00:22:31,795 --> 00:22:34,593
lt had a place for everything.

344
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,531
-Oh, man.
-What?

345
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:42,832
There's a whole series of pockets here
l didn't even know about, Rach. Look.

346
00:22:46,977 --> 00:22:49,571
Ursula, l have the most amazing news.

347
00:22:49,747 --> 00:22:51,908
l found our dad.

348
00:22:52,082 --> 00:22:53,572
Phoebe.

349
00:22:56,553 --> 00:23:00,785
Your sister.
And l found our dad.

350
00:23:00,991 --> 00:23:04,222
