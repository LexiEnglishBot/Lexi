1
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:06,322
Happy birthday!

2
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:07,714
Happy birthday!

3
00:00:10,786 --> 00:00:12,339
Rach, come on.

4
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:13,982
It's your birthday!

5
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:15,862
Hey...

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,619
She's not as pretty as
she was when she was 29.

7
00:00:21,953 --> 00:00:26,544
Ms. Green wants to establish some
ground rules before she comes out.

8
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:30,123
She'd appreciate it if you didn't use
the words "old" or "downhill"...

9
00:00:30,407 --> 00:00:32,839
...or "They still look
pretty damn good."

10
00:00:37,018 --> 00:00:38,157
They do.

11
00:00:39,488 --> 00:00:41,220
Rachel, come on out.

12
00:00:41,784 --> 00:00:43,373
Monica made breakfast.

13
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:45,017
Chocolate chip pancakes.

14
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:47,416
We've got presents.

15
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:51,833
Good ones?

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,834
They all came from the list
you handed out to us two weeks ago.

17
00:00:56,467 --> 00:00:59,421
Can I keep the presents
and still be 29?

18
00:01:00,537 --> 00:01:03,942
Come on, Rach, turning 30
is not that big a deal.

19
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,070
Really? Is that how you felt
when you turned 30?

20
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:09,336
Why, God, why?

21
00:01:10,035 --> 00:01:13,546
We had a deal.
Let the others grow old, not me!

22
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:26,274
You know, I'm still 29 in Guam.

23
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:29,933
Hey, 30 is not that old.

24
00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:32,884
Do you know how old the Earth is?

25
00:01:34,668 --> 00:01:36,127
Late 30s?

26
00:01:37,486 --> 00:01:40,024
You guys, is it just me?
Am I overreacting?

27
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:44,956
No, it's not just you.
My 30th birthday sure wasn't much fun.

28
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,226
And now Chandler!

29
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:51,119
We're all getting so old.

30
00:01:51,368 --> 00:01:53,906
Why are you doing this to us?

31
00:01:58,188 --> 00:02:02,292
The One Where They All Turn Thirty

32
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:40,213
You're in a great place in your life.
You have an amazing job, good friends.

33
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:42,441
Your roommate's a soap opera star.

34
00:02:42,755 --> 00:02:44,558
Your character is in a coma.

35
00:02:46,826 --> 00:02:49,743
I promised myself
I wasn't gonna cry at this one.

36
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:54,895
I know my life's going pretty well,
but I see so many people...

37
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:58,545
...who've accomplished their goals
before they're 30.

38
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:01,570
Yeah, but you shouldn't compare
yourself to me.

39
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:04,979
- Come on, Phoebe!
- You can do it!

40
00:03:06,031 --> 00:03:07,455
- Come on.
- There you go.

41
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:17,188
I did it!
One mile on a Hippity Hop.

42
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,956
That's everything I wanted to do
before I was 30.

43
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,081
Except I wanted to
patch things up with my sister.

44
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:25,470
Oh, well. But, yeah!

45
00:03:27,532 --> 00:03:31,173
Girls, this thing is a godsend,
if you know what I mean.

46
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:44,405
Thirty. Oh, I mean, 30.

47
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,613
Monica, you remember mean, old
Mrs. Kreiger in fifth grade? She was 30.

48
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:52,823
Let's have some fun.
What do you want to do?

49
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:54,801
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.

50
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:59,953
Doing nothing on your 30th is better
than doing something stupid, like Ross.

51
00:04:00,862 --> 00:04:03,009
That was a practical purchase.

52
00:04:03,298 --> 00:04:06,038
I needed that car for transportation.

53
00:04:06,325 --> 00:04:08,650
Okay? I have a child.

54
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:11,393
How hot do I look in this?

55
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:14,777
Ross, a sports car?

56
00:04:15,058 --> 00:04:18,356
Wouldn't it be cheaper
to just stuff a sock down there?

57
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:21,248
That's not what this is about.

58
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,747
I am a sports car enthusiast.

59
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:27,677
- I've always been into cars.
- What's the horsepower?

60
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:30,463
I don't know, but look how shiny!

61
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:38,185
- I can't believe you bought this.
- Really. God, Ross, what were you thinking?

62
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,285
I know it's really shallow,
but part of me wants him again.

63
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,169
Well, get in line, missy.

64
00:04:44,944 --> 00:04:46,533
So can I have a ride, stud?

65
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:48,243
Hop in.

66
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,223
Get ready for the
smoothest ride of your life.

67
00:05:17,613 --> 00:05:18,893
Damn it.

68
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:22,650
Okay, who's next?

69
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,992
I am gonna do something today. I'm not
just gonna sit around like some old lady.

70
00:05:30,278 --> 00:05:32,603
I want to get something pierced.

71
00:05:32,886 --> 00:05:36,113
Like my nose or my tongue or something.

72
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,025
Really? Because that hurts.

73
00:05:38,384 --> 00:05:40,116
So what?
The way I see it...

74
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:41,825
Son of a bitch!

75
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:46,384
Look, I know what
you're going through.

76
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:49,891
I'm totally freaked out
about turning 25.

77
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:55,252
Get out of my apartment.

78
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:58,733
Rach, I think that you're doing great.

79
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,790
Let's face it,
no one handles this well.

80
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:03,948
Least of all you.

81
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:08,570
- Why, what did you do?
- Weren't you asked to leave, sonny?

82
00:06:14,672 --> 00:06:17,269
Put that back on.
Monica will be here any minute.

83
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:19,671
But it hurts my Joey's apple.

84
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:26,977
For the last time, it's not named
after each individual man.

85
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:34,709
You've done a wonderful job with this
party, Chandler. Everything's so lovely.

86
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,484
Well, not as lovely as you.

87
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:40,133
I can't believe you have a
30-year-old daughter.

88
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:44,167
And I can't believe you have
a tux that's 30 years old.

89
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:49,563
It's older than that. Ross was actually
conceived right near this tuxedo.

90
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,680
Everybody hide! I saw her.
She's coming.

91
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:57,495
Everybody down!

92
00:06:58,404 --> 00:06:59,898
Crap.

93
00:07:05,085 --> 00:07:08,631
Everybody stay here.
I'll find out what's going on.

94
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,425
Hey, you got the door open!

95
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,356
Hey, are you drunk?

96
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,783
No.

97
00:07:21,194 --> 00:07:22,297
Okay.

98
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:27,937
Okay.

99
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,773
See, I was a little nervous
about turning...

100
00:07:33,092 --> 00:07:34,444
...30.

101
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:38,414
So the busboys took me out
for some drinks.

102
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:44,224
Might want to puke on you later.

103
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:50,689
Here's the thing. We've thrown
a very formal surprise party for you.

104
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,787
- Your friends are in there,
and your parents. - No!

105
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:55,043
- Yes! Yes!
- No.

106
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:58,480
Oh, no! My parents have never
seen me drunk.

107
00:07:58,942 --> 00:08:00,222
That they know of.

108
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:05,402
We'll get you some coffee.
They'll never know that you're drunk.

109
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:08,124
- You promise?
- I'll take care of it.

110
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,387
I love you so much.

111
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:14,697
Okay, we have to do something
about your breath.

112
00:08:15,677 --> 00:08:18,002
What about your breath?

113
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:21,102
That's still yours.

114
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,655
Now remember,
it's a surprise party.

115
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:28,229
So when you go in, act surprised.

116
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:30,802
Ready?

117
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:39,397
Surprise!

118
00:08:45,737 --> 00:08:47,327
Okay, forward. Forward.

119
00:08:47,581 --> 00:08:48,720
Stop!

120
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,849
Okay, back... Stop!

121
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:55,196
Okay, for... Stop!

122
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,963
Stop! Stop!

123
00:08:57,462 --> 00:09:00,379
Ross, just forget about it.
The guy's got you totally wedged in.

124
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:06,610
- Is this yours?
- No, it's mine! It's mine.

125
00:09:08,178 --> 00:09:10,810
Dude, you so need this car.

126
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:15,195
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

127
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:18,294
I'll break into this minivan,
put it in neutral.

128
00:09:18,581 --> 00:09:21,321
You push it forward
so Ross can drive out of the spot.

129
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:24,382
All right. Here we go.

130
00:09:30,688 --> 00:09:31,897
Haul ass!

131
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:46,062
Happy 30th birthday! Here.

132
00:09:47,283 --> 00:09:50,165
It's for the child in you.
And the woman.

133
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,145
Happy 30th!

134
00:09:52,398 --> 00:09:54,165
Right. Why do you keep saying that?

135
00:09:54,555 --> 00:09:56,844
Because it's our 30th birthday.

136
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,391
Yeah, no, we're not 30.
We're 31. Okay.

137
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:02,619
Wait.

138
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,234
Oh, it's you.

139
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:08,149
Yeah. What?

140
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:10,383
Yeah, we're not 30. We're 31.

141
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,557
That's what it says
on my birth certificate.

142
00:10:14,804 --> 00:10:16,333
You have a birth certificate?

143
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:19,459
I got a big box of family stuff
when my mom died.

144
00:10:20,196 --> 00:10:21,441
Our mom.

145
00:10:21,693 --> 00:10:22,796
Right. Okay.

146
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:28,718
- Do you have mine?
- No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.

147
00:10:31,504 --> 00:10:32,856
Oh, my God.

148
00:10:33,835 --> 00:10:35,887
Oh, my God, we are 31!

149
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:37,660
Yeah.

150
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:41,481
I just lost a whole year of my life.

151
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:42,941
Okay.

152
00:10:44,481 --> 00:10:46,948
- Your middle name is Pamela?
- Yes.

153
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,184
I never knew mine.
Do you remember what it is?

154
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:52,587
Yes. Phoebe.

155
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:57,659
- That's my first name.
- Right. Okay. Then, no.

156
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:04,307
We made it across the room.
You're doing great.

157
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:05,761
What's going on?

158
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:07,546
Monica's a little drunk.

159
00:11:07,896 --> 00:11:09,913
Yeah! I love drunk Monica.

160
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,671
Oh, she's so much more fun
than regular Monica.

161
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,968
She doesn't want her parents to know.

162
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:23,549
All right, all right.
Here's what we'll do.

163
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:27,722
I'll get twice as drunk,
then no one will even notice her.

164
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:33,535
- Drunk Phoebe's mean.
- Okay, you watch your tone with me!

165
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:39,379
What's going on?

166
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:41,460
Monica's wasted.

167
00:11:41,713 --> 00:11:44,287
Maybe that will liven up this party.

168
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:47,344
Will you just help her get changed?

169
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:51,031
Taking care of a drunk, naked woman
seems like a job for Joey.

170
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:57,921
This one's from me.

171
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:00,777
It wasn't on your list,
but it's really fun.

172
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:04,177
A scooter.

173
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:08,180
Stick to the list.

174
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,884
Always stick to the list.

175
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:16,013
No, no, I love it. Thank you.

176
00:12:17,062 --> 00:12:19,007
Open ours next! Open ours next!

177
00:12:19,254 --> 00:12:21,721
Now that you're a couple,
we don't get two gifts?

178
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:25,063
For my last birthday,
you gave me a hug.

179
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:28,020
Read the card! Read the card!

180
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,171
"Happy birthday, Grandma.

181
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:39,214
It's better to be over the hill...

182
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,996
...than buried under it.

183
00:12:45,174 --> 00:12:48,198
All our love, Monica and Chandler."
That's funny.

184
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:50,802
No, no. That was a joke.

185
00:12:51,088 --> 00:12:53,793
I know, I get it. It's funny.

186
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,990
Because you're not a grandma.

187
00:12:56,238 --> 00:12:59,749
To be a grandma, you have to
be married and have children.

188
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:04,407
I don't have any of those things.
That's why it's so funny.

189
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,463
I'm just gonna go...

190
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:13,834
All you had to do was buy the card.

191
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,676
Hey, look who's back.
It's the birthday girl.

192
00:13:22,888 --> 00:13:25,593
How's the birthday girl feeling?

193
00:13:27,619 --> 00:13:31,059
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're
bumming out the rest of the kids.

194
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:38,920
It was stupid to get upset about
not having a husband and kids.

195
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,422
All I really needed was a plan.

196
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:43,650
See, I want three kids.

197
00:13:43,972 --> 00:13:48,942
And you want to have them all at the
same time and have them for your brother.

198
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,451
As I was saying...

199
00:13:52,947 --> 00:13:56,209
I should have the first one
by the time I'm 35.

200
00:13:56,497 --> 00:13:58,573
Which gives me five years.

201
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:01,288
I love this plan. I'm
gonna marry this plan.

202
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,318
If you could do that,
I'd marry the Hippity Hop.

203
00:14:05,508 --> 00:14:09,612
If I want a kid when I'm 35, I don't
have to get pregnant until I'm 34.

204
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:13,533
Which gives Prada four years
to start making maternity clothes.

205
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:20,286
But I want to be married
for a year before I get pregnant.

206
00:14:20,712 --> 00:14:22,585
Really? That long?

207
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:30,379
Look all you want, it's happening.

208
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:37,410
I don't have to get married until
I'm 33. That's three whole years.

209
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,900
Wait a minute, though.

210
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:42,732
I'll need a year and a half
to plan the wedding.

211
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,965
And I'd like to know the guy
for a year, year and a half...

212
00:14:46,283 --> 00:14:48,335
...before we get engaged.

213
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:53,544
Which means I need to meet the guy
by the time I'm 30.

214
00:14:54,911 --> 00:14:58,838
Which is fine
because you just turned...

215
00:14:59,122 --> 00:15:00,818
...28!

216
00:15:01,905 --> 00:15:04,123
No, Ross. No, it is not fine.

217
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,885
I should already be with
the guy I'm gonna marry.

218
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:16,897
Will you quit hogging it?

219
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:25,974
I'm telling you, it's like
watching Bambi learn how to walk.

220
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:28,899
You're drunk.

221
00:15:30,365 --> 00:15:32,796
Mom and Dad are gonna be mad.

222
00:15:35,027 --> 00:15:36,865
Maybe I'm a little drunk.

223
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,898
Are those crab cakes?

224
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:44,860
Did I not tell you to come straight to
me when more crab cakes were ready?

225
00:15:47,203 --> 00:15:48,519
How you feeling?

226
00:15:49,535 --> 00:15:52,132
You are so handsome.

227
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:57,424
I want to make love to you
right here, right now.

228
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:03,026
I really wish that you wouldn't.

229
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:13,262
Just get through a little bit more,
then we can put you in bed.

230
00:16:13,575 --> 00:16:17,573
Just smile and don't talk to anyone.

231
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:22,091
Speech, speech!
Let's hear from the birthday girl.

232
00:16:23,213 --> 00:16:24,185
Pheebs!

233
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:26,410
See, everybody's looking at me.

234
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:28,081
The plan's working.

235
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:32,219
I didn't even have to
take off my top yet.

236
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:34,689
Speech. Come on, speech!

237
00:16:38,313 --> 00:16:41,611
You can't keep your hands off her
for one second.

238
00:16:41,896 --> 00:16:43,391
I think it's nice.

239
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,545
I think it's necessary.

240
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:56,571
I want to thank you all for coming.

241
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:58,726
My family and...

242
00:16:59,049 --> 00:16:59,985
...my friends.

243
00:17:04,302 --> 00:17:06,805
I'd really like to say that I'm...

244
00:17:08,756 --> 00:17:11,602
You know what I'd really like to say?

245
00:17:12,374 --> 00:17:13,998
I'm drunk!

246
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:18,456
That's right, Mom and Dad.

247
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:22,074
Your little Harmomica is hammered.

248
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,627
And guess what?

249
00:17:25,908 --> 00:17:27,889
I've been drunk before.

250
00:17:28,795 --> 00:17:31,227
And I've smoked a cigarette.

251
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:36,159
And I've had a box of Ding Dongs
hidden in my underwear drawer.

252
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:41,065
It's all okay.
It's okay because...

253
00:17:41,355 --> 00:17:43,193
...I turned 30 today.

254
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:46,851
And I can do anything I want.

255
00:17:47,374 --> 00:17:50,186
Because I am a grownup.

256
00:17:56,073 --> 00:17:58,742
Okay, quick. Help me get this off.

257
00:18:02,822 --> 00:18:04,245
I lost a whole year.

258
00:18:04,527 --> 00:18:07,100
I can't believe it.
This is so unfair!

259
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,289
Come on, Pheebs, it'll be okay.

260
00:18:09,536 --> 00:18:10,781
Will it? Will it?

261
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,778
How would you feel if
you found out you were 31?

262
00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:18,818
That's not gonna happen.
Because we have a new deal.

263
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:22,189
Plus, it ruined my schedule.

264
00:18:22,445 --> 00:18:26,443
I haven't done any of the things
I wanted to do by the time I was 31.

265
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:30,960
- Like what? - Like I haven't
met any Portuguese people.

266
00:18:31,282 --> 00:18:33,820
I haven't had the perfect kiss.

267
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:36,282
And I haven't been to sniper school.

268
00:18:38,414 --> 00:18:41,510
Why don't we go and
have some birthday cake.

269
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:45,960
I just feel like being by myself for
a while. See you guys later. Thanks.

270
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:49,541
Poor Pheebs.

271
00:18:50,174 --> 00:18:53,684
Hey, you know what, you guys? I think
I'm gonna walk her home.

272
00:18:57,097 --> 00:18:59,635
- Oh, man.
- What?

273
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,825
He's gonna eat the cake.

274
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,023
Pheebs!

275
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:06,832
Listen, I...

276
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:08,809
Close your eyes.

277
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,509
That's one thing you can
cross off your list.

278
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:27,988
Oh, yeah.

279
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:32,784
Plus, I'm one-sixteenth Portuguese.

280
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:39,114
Okay, is everybody clear?

281
00:19:39,404 --> 00:19:41,349
We're gonna pick it up...

282
00:19:43,544 --> 00:19:44,931
...and move it.

283
00:19:46,188 --> 00:19:50,601
All we need is teamwork.
We're gonna lift the car...

284
00:19:51,477 --> 00:19:53,623
...and slide it out.

285
00:19:56,556 --> 00:19:57,694
Lift...

286
00:19:58,017 --> 00:19:59,785
...and slide.

287
00:20:00,313 --> 00:20:03,018
- Ross, I really don't think this...
- Lift...

288
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:06,393
...and slide.

289
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,604
All right. Come on, dogs,
let's lift this sucker.

290
00:20:11,412 --> 00:20:15,481
Oh, unless you're scared.
Little weaklings scared?

291
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:17,044
Good teamwork.

292
00:20:18,057 --> 00:20:20,560
- Okay, here we go.
- All right, everyone.

293
00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:22,429
Lift...

294
00:20:26,337 --> 00:20:28,319
...and slide.

295
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:36,280
- Hey, Joey...
- Come on, Rach, my turn just started.

296
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,756
Actually, I just want to talk to Tag.

297
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,964
Oh, okay.
Hey, can I ride this outside?

298
00:20:43,246 --> 00:20:45,263
Whatever. I'm not your mother.

299
00:20:46,308 --> 00:20:47,968
Not in the street!

300
00:20:51,736 --> 00:20:55,935
- Are you feeling any better?
- Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm...

301
00:20:57,407 --> 00:20:58,687
Let's talk.

302
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,448
What's up?

303
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,260
Oh, Tag...

304
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:08,883
You're such a great guy.
And we have so much fun together.

305
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,304
- But I...
- Wait.

306
00:21:11,323 --> 00:21:13,268
I think I see where you're going.

307
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,191
But before you say anything else,
can I say one more thing?

308
00:21:25,797 --> 00:21:27,077
Well said.

309
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:32,780
And a good example of the fun
I was referring to.

310
00:21:34,217 --> 00:21:39,152
But I think I'm past the point
where I can just have fun.

311
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:42,876
Rachel, don't do this. This is just
because you're turning 30.

312
00:21:43,158 --> 00:21:44,546
Yeah, it is.

313
00:21:45,384 --> 00:21:48,610
But you're just a kid.
I mean, you're 25.

314
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,604
- Twenty-four, actually.
- Oh, God.

315
00:21:54,152 --> 00:21:59,015
You know what I wish?
I wish you were six years older.

316
00:21:59,335 --> 00:22:03,713
Well, if I'm wishing for stuff,
I actually wish I was six years younger.

317
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:07,538
- Me too.
- Yeah. Sorry.

318
00:22:16,592 --> 00:22:17,873
Hey, how'd it go?

319
00:22:19,376 --> 00:22:23,932
If I only want two kids,
can I keep him for another year?

320
00:22:25,395 --> 00:22:27,198
You did the right thing.

321
00:22:31,796 --> 00:22:33,908
I don't like this anymore.

322
00:22:38,615 --> 00:22:42,020
Well, here we are.
Just a bunch of 30-year-olds.

323
00:22:43,313 --> 00:22:47,547
Do you realize in 10 years
we're gonna be 40?

324
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:52,460
Why, God?

325
00:22:52,776 --> 00:22:55,314
Why are you doing this to us?

326
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:05,821
Yes! My baby's finally free.

327
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:07,382
All right!

328
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:10,061
Start it up. Let's go!

329
00:23:19,183 --> 00:23:20,606
How hot are we?

330
00:23:28,437 --> 00:23:30,382
You want to buy a car?
