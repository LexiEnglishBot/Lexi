1
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:09,308
Slow down! The will not be
sold out at 1:00 in the morning.

2
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:12,102
I'm excited!
I've never got reviewed before!

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,872
You were so amazing as the king!
I'm really impressed.

4
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,309
Although you know what?

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,018
You might wanna concider wear
underwear next time.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,953
When you sat on the throne,
you could see your...

7
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:25,782
...royal subjects.

8
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,590
Come on, no one wear
underwear back then.

9
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,289
I am sure the critic will
appreciate your authority.

10
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,323
Nice gender, by the way!

11
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,335
Thanks man!

12
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:37,529
Here it is! Here it is!

13
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,663
"The only thing worse than
the mindless adolescent direction...

14
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:46,776
...was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly
unskilled portrayal of the king."

15
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,442
Okay, look.
That is one guy's opinion.

16
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,276
All right?
Pheebs, read yours.

17
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:56,114
"The only thing worse than
the mindless, adolescent direction"

18
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,324
Anybody have one
from a different paper?

19
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,153
Ross, read yours.

20
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,193
I don't want to.

21
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,222
The only enjoyable moment...

22
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,131
...was when the king has been
hanged and he can speak no more.

23
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,370
Joey, they don't know
what they're talking about.

24
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:15,873
Maybe they do.

25
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:20,236
I've done this 10 years and I'm
nowhere. There's gotta be a reason.

26
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,811
Come on, you're just
paying your dues.

27
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,074
No, no, no. It's too hard.

28
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,251
It's not worth it. I quit.

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,680
Come on, Joey!

30
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,287
Wait, wait one minute.
Wait a minute.

31
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,219
I believe this will change your mind.

32
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:39,157
"In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiani
achieved brilliant levels of

33
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,557
Continued on page 153.

34
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,561
Sucking."

35
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:49,041
The One With Russ

36
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,813
It there anything else
you ever wanna to be?

37
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,822
I used to want to be a vet.

38
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:40,457
Then I found out you have
to put your hands into cows.

39
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,799
Are you okay?

40
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,728
Just a tough day at work, you know?

41
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,198
Stegosaurus fell over, trapped a kid.

42
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,871
I know this jacket.
This is Fun Bobby's jacket!

43
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,204
Where is he?
He's here, isn't he?

44
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,208
- Maybe.
- Don't toy with me.

45
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:03,511
Geller!

46
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,342
Hey, Fun Bobby!

47
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,449
Hey! You been working out?

48
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,687
Not at all.

49
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,389
I love this guy!

50
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,223
I'm so excited to hear
you're back with my sister.

51
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,553
- You and me both!
- So what'd I miss?

52
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,161
We were trying
to make Joey feel better.

53
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,196
Need me to pick you up?

54
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,201
No, I'm all right, man.

55
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,733
No, I'm picking you up!

56
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,233
No, seriously.
I don't need you to

57
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,238
It still works!

58
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,604
Before I go, does anybody else
need to be picked up?

59
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,380
I'm still gonna go.

60
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,648
See you later, babe.

61
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:45,554
Public display of affection coming up.
You can avert your eyes.

62
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:53,762
See you.

63
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,026
Fun Bobby is so great.

64
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,362
Oh, isn't he?

65
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:03,268
I think this time it may work with him.
He makes me feel so good.

66
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,808
I've been feeling so lousy lately.
No job, no boyfriend.

67
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,310
Well, at least my cup is half full.

68
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,074
Half full of love!

69
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:18,351
For our two-week anniversary,
he's taking me to his cousin's cabin.

70
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,559
Cabin of love!

71
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,959
We went through
a lot of wine tonight.

72
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,459
I only had two glasses.

73
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:27,722
I had a glass.

74
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:28,831
Two.

75
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:29,932
I had one glass.

76
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,500
I had a mug full in this...

77
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,796
...I-got-boned-at-the-
Museum-of-Natural-History mug.

78
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,244
Okay, so that's what?
Two bottles.

79
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,912
And yet somehow we went through five?

80
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,789
So what?
So he drank a lot tonight.

81
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,698
Now that I think about it,
I don't think...

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,764
...I've ever seen Fun
Bobby without a drink.

83
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:09,167
And did you notice how
he always starts his stories with...

84
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:14,108
..."Okay, I was so wasted!"
Or "Oh, we were so bombed!"

85
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:17,248
"So I wake up and I'm in
this dumpster in Connecticut!"

86
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,148
Have you been with him
when he wasn't drinking?

87
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:26,085
We just happen to go to a lot
of places where you might drink.

88
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,489
How do you go to a wine-tasting
without having a drink?

89
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,328
Or to a club, or to the...

90
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,859
...zoo.

91
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,896
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?

92
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,732
I don't know, taste it.

93
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,545
Too late, you already had some.

94
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,216
What do you say
we make these coffees Irish?

95
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:00,981
Cake!

96
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,955
Yeah, we're gonna get some cake.

97
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,560
It seems like you've been making
an awful lot of stuff "Irish" lately.

98
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:16,171
I'd make them Belgian, but the waffles
are hard to get into that flask.

99
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,266
Yeah, okay.

100
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:24,242
Maybe it's none of my business.
Or maybe it is, I don't know.

101
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,412
I'm worried about you.

102
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,889
This isn't the first time somebody
said something to me about this.

103
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,754
But I always made excuses,
like "I'm just a social drinker."

104
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,496
Or "Come on, it's Flag Day!"

105
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,429
So, what are you saying now?

106
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,800
I guess I'm saying...

107
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,436
...I'll try and quit.

108
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,803
I like that you worry about me.

109
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,447
So, what's going on?

110
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,008
I am gonna try and quit drinking.

111
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,741
Oh! Why?

112
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,359
Guess who's back in show biz!

113
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:10,728
Lorne Greene?

114
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:15,592
No. You know why?
Because he's dead.

115
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,096
Oh, no.

116
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,469
This is gonna seem bittersweet now...

117
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,732
...but Joey, that's who!

118
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,078
My agent called with an audition
for Days Of Our Lives!

119
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:29,677
Kick ass!

120
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,958
We have to celebrate!
We should do a soap opera theme.

121
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:45,628
We could all sleep together,
then one of us could get amnesia!

122
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,598
When do you get off?
We'll do something tonight.

123
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,170
Well, actually, I'm already done.
But I kind of got plans.

124
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,834
You have other friends?

125
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:03,814
I have a date.

126
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:04,846
What?

127
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,018
With a man?

128
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,421
No, with Crule John.

129
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,654
What's so strange
about me having a date?

130
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:16,854
With Crule John.

131
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,292
What about Ross?

132
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,034
You're still mad
because he made that list?

133
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,669
No, no, I'm not mad at him.

134
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,430
I'm not really "anything"
at him anymore.

135
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,174
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

136
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,340
Whatever I was feeling, I'm...

137
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:36,411
...not.

138
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,241
But you guys came so close.

139
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,510
I'm sorry. You'll have
to get used to the fact...

140
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,813
...that I will not be dating Ross.

141
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,916
Here he is.

142
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,758
Guys, this is Russ.

143
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:16,048
I'm not saying you're not talented.
You're very talented.

144
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:20,257
But with the bird dead and all,
there's very little act left.

145
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,124
Honey, give me a break, will you?

146
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,693
I'll talk to you later.

147
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,728
There's my favorite client!

148
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,558
So tell me, darling,
how was the audition?

149
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:33,804
I think it went well.
I got a callback for Thursday.

150
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,065
Joey! Have you ever
seen me ecstatic?

151
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,068
Well, here it is.

152
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,251
Okay! Listen, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

153
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:49,511
The casting lady

154
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,757
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?

155
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:52,955
She's great.

156
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,094
But I kind of got the feeling that
she was sort of coming on to me.

157
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:03,732
And I definitely would get the part
if I were to, you know...

158
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,534
If I sent the little general in.

159
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:16,778
I see! Well, I'm just gonna
put in a call here...

160
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:20,543
...and we'll find out what's going on
and straighten it out.

161
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,087
Lori, please.

162
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,952
Hi, darling!

163
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:30,261
How about Joey Tribbiani
for the part of the cab driver?

164
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,191
Isn't he terrific?

165
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,701
Okay, doll, talk to you later.

166
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,330
You're gonna have to sleep with her.

167
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,275
- What's the matter?
- Fun Bobby.

168
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,810
What? Isn't he sober?

169
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,413
Oh, he's sober all right.

170
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,310
Turns out that Fun Bobby
was fun for a reason.

171
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,587
All right, here you go, sweetie.

172
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,928
Thanks. You wanna
hear something funny?

173
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,754
Oh, God, yes!

174
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,800
There are no hardware stores open
past midnight in the Village.

175
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:16,431
That is funny.

176
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,343
I needed to buy a hammer and I'm out
walking around the neighborhood.

177
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:27,284
And I am walking, and I am
walking, and I am walking

178
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,686
So you are saying you are walking

179
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:31,882
But apparently...

180
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:37,057
...there are no hardware stores open
past midnight in the Village.

181
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:44,102
So it's help for fat...

182
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,104
...as well as funny.

183
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,737
Don't you have to
be at your interview?

184
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,675
Oh, yeah.

185
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,142
See you guys.

186
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,249
Bye...

187
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,145
...ridiculously dull Bobby.

188
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:05,954
Oh, my God.

189
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,454
He's not that bad.

190
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:11,629
Not that bad?
Did you not hear the hammer story?

191
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,991
Okay, don't get all squinky.

192
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,532
Maybe it's the kind of story
where you had to be there.

193
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,136
But I'm gonna be there!

194
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,704
For the rest of my life.

195
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:27,837
I can't dump him. I made him
quit drinking. I made him dull!

196
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,240
Don't say that.

197
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,780
He's probably always been dull.
You just, you know...

198
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,314
...set it free.

199
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:37,685
Hey, Ross.

200
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,291
Hi, Russ.

201
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,654
I've got two more tables
to clean, and then we'll go.

202
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,127
I'll just sit here and...

203
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,431
...chat with your...

204
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:53,428
...friend-type people.

205
00:12:58,878 --> 00:12:59,708
Rachel?

206
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,209
So, you know what
you're doing, right?

207
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,110
Waitressing?

208
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,853
Well, yeah. But, no.
I mean...

209
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,590
Doesn't Russ just
remind you of someone?

210
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,720
Bob Saget?

211
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,226
Oh, yeah!

212
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,122
No, no, no!

213
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,493
Oh, my, oh!

214
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,298
What's wrong?

215
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,433
She's upset because...

216
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:30,608
...she buttered a spider
into her toast this morning.

217
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:33,637
All right.

218
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,473
Listen, Pheebs.
This is gonna be okay.

219
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,918
Ross, Russ.
Russ, Ross.

220
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,115
Are you a friend of Rachel's?

221
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,383
Yes. Yes, I am.

222
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:51,221
Are you a friend of Rachel's?

223
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,330
Actually, I'm kind of a...

224
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,759
...you know...

225
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,860
...a date-type thing...

226
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,368
...of Rachel's.

227
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,669
A date?

228
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,469
I'm her date.

229
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,473
Oh! Oh, you're a...

230
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,272
Oh, you're the date.

231
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:10,976
This is actually good...

232
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,845
...because if we lose Ross,
we have a spare.

233
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,345
Oh! You are the paleontologist.

234
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,983
Yes. Yes, I am.
And you are a...

235
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:23,858
Periodontist.

236
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,199
See? Now they're as
different as night and...

237
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,567
...later that night.

238
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:33,764
Well, I am going to get a beverage.

239
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,031
It was nice meeting you.

240
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,242
Ditto.

241
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,878
Well, I met Russ.

242
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,383
Hey, I didn't know
we were seeing other people.

243
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,825
Well, we're not
seeing each other, so...

244
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,527
For your information,
there's a woman at the museum...

245
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,698
...who's curator of moths and other...

246
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:02,897
...winged things...

247
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:09,332
...who's let it be known that
she is drawn to me, much like a...

248
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,371
...you know.

249
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:14,775
I've kept her at bay,
but if this is the deal

250
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,241
This is the deal.

251
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,416
Okay, well, have a nice evening.

252
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,648
Russ, you ready?

253
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,360
She's dating?

254
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,051
She's dating?

255
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:34,357
Yes, but did you see
who she was dating?

256
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,097
What do you mean?

257
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,464
- Do you not see it?
- See what?

258
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,467
I don't know what she sees
in that goober!

259
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,369
It takes him, what?
Like, I don't know...

260
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,046
...hello, a week
to get out a sentence?

261
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,547
It's annoying, isn't it?

262
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,562
You didn't get the part...

263
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,169
...or Italy called
and said it was hungry?

264
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,904
The part's mine if I want it.

265
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:17,439
Oh, my God!

266
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,405
If I'm willing to sleep
with the casting lady.

267
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:21,839
Oh, my...

268
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,207
...God?

269
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,147
Ten years I've been waiting
for a break like this. Ten years!

270
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,049
I mean, Days of our Lives.
That's actually on television!

271
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,424
What are you gonna do?

272
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,093
I guess I could sleep with her.
I mean...

273
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,727
How can I do that?

274
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:42,797
I've got a pop-up book that told me
everything I need to know.

275
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,762
I've never slept
with someone for a part.

276
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,131
Well, is she

277
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,440
Sorry.

278
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,605
Is she good-looking?

279
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:57,109
She's totally good-looking.
If I met her in a bar...

280
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,611
...I'd be buying her breakfast.

281
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,350
After having slept with her.

282
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,188
Maybe this isn't such a big deal.

283
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:16,333
The way that I see it is, you get a
great job, and you get to have sex!

284
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,138
Throw in a tree and a fat guy,
and you've got Christmas!

285
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,808
I just don't think that
I want it that way, though.

286
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,481
I mean, let's say
I do make it, all right?

287
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:34,879
I'll always look back and wonder
if it was because of my talent or...

288
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,951
...you know, the little general.

289
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:42,592
Didn't you used to call it
"the little major"?

290
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,295
After Denise DeMarco,
I had to promote it.

291
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,826
Something from the bar?

292
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,801
Yes, I would like something.

293
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,899
No. No, thank you.

294
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:01,840
If you wanna drink, it's okay with me.
I've gotta get used to it.

295
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,777
No, no, really.
I wouldn't feel right about it.

296
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,515
Just some water, please.

297
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,778
- So my refrigerator light's out.
- Scotch on the rocks with a twist!

298
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,124
We're having some fun now, huh, Ross?

299
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,692
Wanna do another one?
Huh, Russ?

300
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,062
Eleven letters...

301
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:27,130
...atomic element number 101,
ends in "ium."

302
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:28,404
Dysprosium.

303
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,471
Dysprosium.

304
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,175
Try mendelevium.

305
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,637
And weenie number two has it.

306
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,178
Unless "Knights in White Satin"
was sung by the Doody Blues.

307
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,679
You don't see it?
You actually don't see it?

308
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:46,788
What?

309
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,123
Honey, you're dating Ross.

310
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,022
No, Pheebs, I'm dating Russ.

311
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,697
Russ is Ross. Russ, Ross.

312
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,331
Steve, sleeve.

313
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,030
No one is named sleeve.

314
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,769
What are you talking about?

315
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,066
Other than their names being similar,
I do not see what you're seeing.

316
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,937
For your information...

317
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,442
...it's a card sharp,
not a card shark.

318
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,205
You could not be more wrong.

319
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,985
You could try,
but you would not be successful.

320
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,152
I'm gonna get some more coffee before
the pinching and eye-poking begins.

321
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,253
I know your problem.

322
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,721
Oh, you do, do you?

323
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,259
You're jealous.

324
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,567
Of what?

325
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,268
You're jealous
because I'm a real doctor.

326
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,102
Hey, you're a doctor of gums.

327
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,809
That's the smallest body part
you can major in.

328
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,004
Day one, floss.
Day two, here's your diploma.

329
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,237
You listen here

330
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,313
- Let me finish.
- No, let me finish.

331
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,486
No, you let me fin

332
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,495
Did Joey say what he was gonna do?

333
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,569
I don't even think he knew.

334
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:09,363
Would you sleep with somebody
to get a great job?

335
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,073
Who would I have to sleep with?

336
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,368
Me.

337
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,673
Why with you?

338
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,113
It's my game.
You want the job or not?

339
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:24,686
Good morning.

340
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,048
Where you going?

341
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:29,294
Bobby and I are going away
for the weekend. Remember?

342
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,220
What's with all the liquor?

343
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,638
What's going on?
Is Bobby drinking again?

344
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,307
This is not for him.
This is for me.

345
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:50,441
That way, he's sober but his
shoelace stories are more amusing.

346
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,381
God! Even his knock is boring!

347
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,256
- I'll be ready in a second.
- Could I talk to you?

348
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,292
Sure.

349
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,960
This is hard for me to say.

350
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,963
You fell off the wagon!

351
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,329
Oh, no, no.

352
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:13,768
It's about you.

353
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,497
What about me?

354
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,303
I think you may have
a drinking problem.

355
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:22,907
What, these?

356
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,409
No, these are for cuts and scrapes.

357
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:31,780
Look, I'm not strong enough to be
in a codependent relationship.

358
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,556
Oh, shoot.

359
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:40,230
Well, anyway,
I hope we can be friends.

360
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:45,666
Take care.

361
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:48,338
- You too.
- Goodbye.

362
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:52,935
What happened?

363
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,172
We kind of broke up.

364
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,821
Does anybody want these?

365
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,283
I'll take one.

366
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,727
Sometimes I hold stuff like this
and pretend I'm a giant.

367
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,062
How'd the callback go?

368
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:22,034
It was unbelievable. I walked
in there and she was all over me.

369
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,333
- What did you do?
- I couldn't do it.

370
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,407
I didn't want the part that way.

371
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,474
Good for you!

372
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:29,237
But wait!
I left her office...

373
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:33,541
...and she caught up with me
and offered me a bigger part.

374
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:34,883
So, and?

375
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:41,048
So, you are now looking at
Dr. Drake Ramoray, neurosurgeon...

376
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,851
...recurring in
at least four episodes!

377
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:46,960
All right, I gotta go shower.

378
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,614
I guess you guys heard
Rachel dumped me.

379
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,283
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

380
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,283
She said I remind her
too much of somebody.

381
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,319
Any idea who
she's talking about?

382
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,920
Oh, I do. It's Bob Saget.

383
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,421
She hates him.

384
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,192
Hey, Julie!

385
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,025
How are you doing?

386
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,398
I don't know. It's weird
not being with Ross...

387
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,732
...but I guess I'm doing okay.

388
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,806
Actually, I've got some
of his stuff that he...

389
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,353
- Have we met?
- I don't think so.

390
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,947
You look so familiar.

391
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:52,457
May be we can talk about it
over a cup of coffee.

392
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:57,491
You know what I'm sick of coffe.
Let's go and get some juice.

393
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:02,700
All right! Bye!
