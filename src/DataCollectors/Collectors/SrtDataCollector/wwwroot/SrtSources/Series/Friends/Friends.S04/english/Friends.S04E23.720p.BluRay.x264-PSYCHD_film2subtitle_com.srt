1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,628
You guys, hurry up.
The flight leaves in four hours.

2
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:07,506
There could be traffic.
The plane could leave early.

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:11,510
When we get to London,
there could be a line at customs. Come on.

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:16,598
Six-hour trip to London.
That's a lot of Monica.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,312
Passport, check. Camera, check.
Traveler's checks, check.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,815
- Who are you saying "check" to?
- Myself.

7
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,608
For remembering to pack the thing.

8
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,652
You know, you do a good thing,
you get a check.

9
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,824
My mom does it.
I never realized it was weird.

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,286
Hey, my mom used to put her head
in the oven, so...

11
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,789
Actually, she only did it the one time.
But it was pretty weird.

12
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,668
- Hey.
- Hey.

13
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,253
Hey. Are you ready yet?

14
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,757
- Yep. You got the tickets?
- Oh, got them right here. Check.

15
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:54,303
It's all London, baby. Here we go.

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,182
You got your passport?

17
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:02,394
Yeah, in my third drawer of my dresser.
You don't wanna lose that.

18
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,026
- Oh.
- There it is.

19
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:01,161
Okay, if you need the vacuum,
it's in my closet on the left side.

20
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,705
The garbage bags
are next to the refrigerator.

21
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,500
But Rachel's gonna be here too.
Can't I just ask her?

22
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,961
Heh. Yeah, okay. Give that a try.

23
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,880
- All right, let's do it.
- Woohoo.

24
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,216
- Yeah. Cheerio.
- London, baby.

25
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,928
- Because that's not gonna get annoying.
- London, baby!

26
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,141
- Oh, you know what? I was wrong.
- Ha, ha.

27
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,601
Well, we're all here.
I guess we should get going.

28
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,062
Oh, I wanna come over there
and give you a hug...

29
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,940
...and wish you luck on your wedding,
but I can't get up.

30
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:33,735
- Oh, I'll come hug you.
- Great, can you bring me the newspaper?

31
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,445
Yeah.

32
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,781
- Have a great wedding. Oh.
- Thanks.

33
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,117
- Hey, Chandler, I wanna hug you too.
- Hey.

34
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:44,413
And you might as well bring me my book.
It's on the counter in your apartment.

35
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,665
Oh.

36
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,211
- So we're off.
- Have fun.

37
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,880
- Thanks.
- Oh.

38
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,716
Oh. I can't believe
you're not gonna be there.

39
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:56,925
Oh, I know.

40
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,678
- So come. Why don't you come?
- What?

41
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,140
To London. Come to London. Please?
It would mean so much to me.

42
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,517
Yeah, well, I gotta work. I'm sorry.

43
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:10,647
- Why can't you take a couple of days off?
- Because I can't. I told you. No, I can't.

44
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,024
This is my wedding.

45
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,737
All right, you know what? Now we are late.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

46
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,491
Fine, you'll watch it on video
when we get back.

47
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,704
Here you go, Phoebe. Here you go, Phoebo,
Phoobala, Phobayboo.

48
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,501
You. Ha, ha.

49
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,463
All right, let's go. Bye, Pheebs.

50
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,340
- Bye.
- Bye, Pheebs.

51
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,009
Mwah. Goodbye. Mwah.

52
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,636
- Bye.
- Safe flight.

53
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,554
London, baby.

54
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,893
- Oh, God.
- Oh. Do you need a hug?

55
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,563
You don't have to bring me anything.

56
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,665
All right, Chandler, do something.

57
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:15,212
- Come on, do something.
- I am. I'm ignoring you.

58
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,756
Okay, I'm gonna be
the on-camera guy. All right.

59
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:22,761
First stop, Westminster Abbey.

60
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,807
- Oh, what the hell is that?
- That's London, baby.

61
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,850
All right, the hotel's here.

62
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,603
Wait. No, we wanna go...

63
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,524
No.

64
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,234
I know.

65
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,861
I'm gonna have to go into the map.

66
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:48,662
Okay, if you see a little version
of me in there, kill it.

67
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,372
I got it.

68
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,749
Here we go.

69
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:58,005
Okay, listen, listen, we're not gonna have
to walk this way the entire time, are we?

70
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,464
Shh.

71
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,175
Oh, man, you made me lose it.

72
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,933
And that was all before 10:00.

73
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:13,395
The caterer rang to say it's gonna be
chicken kiev instead of tarragon.

74
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,856
The florist phoned
to say there aren't any tulips.

75
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,525
Oh, and then the cellist
has carpal tunnel syndrome...

76
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,736
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Emily, honey. Okay?

77
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,113
- Well, up yours too.
- What?

78
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,783
- No, no. That's "time-out."
- Sorry.

79
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:30,829
Sweetie, you gotta relax.
Everything's gonna be great, okay?

80
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,789
Come on, come on.

81
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,544
- Chicken kiev?
Mm-hm.

82
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,255
Doesn't that sound delicious
at the last minute?

83
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,632
I know, but something like salmon
would just...

84
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,093
It would be so much more elegant
than chicken.

85
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,263
And you wouldn't have to worry
about the salmonella.

86
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,432
Oh.

87
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,851
I can't wait to see
where you're getting married.

88
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,438
Yes. This place is beautiful.
Emily's parents got married here.

89
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,690
I still can't believe
they're tearing it down.

90
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,360
It really is the most lovely building
you'll ever see.

91
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,944
I mean, it's over...

92
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,616
Oh, my God.

93
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,619
It's nice.

94
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:22,005
Oh. Oh, my God.

95
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,424
How can this be happening?
What are we gonna do?

96
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,510
Everything's gonna be all right.

97
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,971
- How is it gonna be all right?
- Uh-huh, I see that.

98
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,308
Okay, I talked to the guy
and found out what happened.

99
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,811
- What?
- They tore it down a few days early.

100
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,817
All right.

101
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,027
Westminster Abbey.

102
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,780
Hands down, best abbey I ever seen.

103
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,366
Hey.

104
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,826
Okay.

105
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,036
What do you think of the abbey,
Chandler?

106
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:57,040
Oh, I think it's great.
They're thinking of changing the name.

107
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,419
- Really? To what?
- To "Put the Camera Away."

108
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,464
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.

109
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:15,559
- Honey, don't get up. What do you need?
- Oh, no. Oh, nothing.

110
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,937
Come on. I'm here to take care of you.
What do you need? Anything.

111
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,981
Okay, I have a wedgie.

112
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,943
Okay, that is all you.

113
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,157
So, what do you want for lunch?

114
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,367
Oh, I don't know.

115
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,829
- I guess we have to eat.
- Yeah, I do.

116
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,623
What's the matter?

117
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,626
I'm just bummed
the way I left things with Ross.

118
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,087
I wish I didn't lie to him
about having to work.

119
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,672
He seemed so mad at me.

120
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,593
Ah, don't be so hard on yourself.
If someone I was still in love with was...

121
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,679
- Still in love with?
- Yeah.

122
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,264
I'm not in love with Ross.

123
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,099
Oh.

124
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,228
No, no. Good.

125
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,980
Yeah, me neither.

126
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,193
Phoebe, I'm not going to Ross' wedding,
because he's my ex-boyfriend...

127
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,154
...and that would be
really uncomfortable.

128
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,658
Not because I'm still in love with him.
Hey, I like Ross as much as the next guy.

129
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,454
You know, clearly I have feelings for him,
but feelings don't mean love.

130
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,790
You know, I mean,
do I still have loving feelings for Ross?

131
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,709
Yeah.

132
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,754
I have continuing feelings of love.

133
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,548
But that doesn't mean
that I'm still in love with him.

134
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:32,469
You know, I mean, I have sexual feelings
for him, but I do love him.

135
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,766
Oh, my God. Oh, my...

136
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,851
Why didn't you tell me?

137
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,813
- We thought you knew.
- We?

138
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:47,067
Yeah, we all know.
We talk about it all the time.

139
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,529
You all know? Does Ross know?

140
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,657
Oh, no. Ross doesn't know anything.

141
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,700
Oh. I cannot believe you didn't tell me.

142
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,703
Because we thought you knew.
It's so obvious.

143
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,706
God, it would be like, you know,
telling Monica:

144
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,209
"Hey," you know, "you like things clean."

145
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,256
Hi.

146
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,675
So, what are you fine gentlemen
in the market for?

147
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:16,471
- We've got scarves, souvenir postcards.
- Check this out, huh?

148
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,390
Oh, yeah.

149
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,850
That's the stuff. What do you think?

150
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:24,396
Well, I'm not gonna have to buy that
"I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.

151
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,941
Well, I like it. Here you go.

152
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,861
You're not really gonna buy that. Don't you
think you've embarrassed me enough?

153
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,488
Oh, I embarrass you?

154
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,700
How can I answer that
when I'm pretending I don't know you?

155
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,495
He's just jealous. You'll fit right in.
All Londoners wear them.

156
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:44,833
Oh, really? Then how come no one here
anywhere is wearing one?

157
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,252
They're all tourists.

158
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,423
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that
in public, you know...

159
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,176
...you're gonna spend the rest
of the afternoon all by yourself.

160
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,970
Oh, yeah?

161
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,311
If you're gonna make me choose
between you and the hat, I choose the hat.

162
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,520
- Good choice.
- Thanks.

163
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,731
Okay, look. All right, that's it, okay?

164
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:11,192
I'm out of here.
I'm not gonna be embarrassed anymore.

165
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,495
- Hello?
- Hey.

166
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,706
I just spoke to your dad,
and you know what?

167
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,083
He thinks we'll be able
to find a new place.

168
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:30,003
- We don't have to.
- What, you found a place?

169
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,423
No, but Monica and I were talking...

170
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,760
...and I was so upset about the hall
being knocked down...

171
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,971
...and she suggested
that we just put the wedding off for a bit.

172
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,935
- She said what?
- She said if I'm not happy...

173
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,981
...getting married somewhere we can find
in a day, well, we should just postpone it.

174
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,361
Postpone it? Heh.

175
00:10:56,072 --> 00:11:00,325
Emily, do you think Monica realizes how
much our parents spent on this wedding?

176
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:05,038
Huh? Do you think my sister's teeny,
tiny little brain comprehends...

177
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,624
...that people took time
out of their lives...

178
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,710
...to fly thousands of miles
to be here? Huh?

179
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,049
This isn't right.

180
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,469
I realize that people
are gonna be disappointed.

181
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,014
But they'll come back
when we can do it right.

182
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,685
Well, I can't ask people to do that.
Would you ask people to do that?

183
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,436
Don't you point your pants at me.

184
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,981
We have no choice.

185
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,068
Anywhere that's half-decent
will have been booked months ago.

186
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,779
Ross, don't you understand?
This is our wedding.

187
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,865
The only thing I understand
is postponing it is not an option.

188
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,659
This is when we're getting married.

189
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,954
- What are you saying, it's now or never?
- No, I'm saying it's now.

190
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,540
- Or?
- There's no "or" in mine.

191
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,625
What is wrong with these pants?

192
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,797
It's not the pants.
It's you who's backwards.

193
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,134
And if you don't understand
how important this is to me...

194
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,594
...perhaps we shouldn't
be getting married at all.

195
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,013
Emily, no. Wait, stop. Emily, please...

196
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,817
- Hey.
- Hi.

197
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,112
So did shopping help you feel any better
about Ross?

198
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,157
Manhattan does not have enough stores.

199
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,952
Well, I think I can help you get over him.

200
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,454
- You can?
- Yeah.

201
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,206
I just need you to bring me
some photos of Ross...

202
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,084
...and, um, a small piece of chocolate...

203
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,253
...and a glass of tepid water.

204
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:39,674
Ooh. Is this one of those things where you
throw stuff in a bag with graveyard dirt...

205
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,885
...and hang it from a north-facing tree?

206
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,637
Uh, only if you have the hiccups too.

207
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,517
The pictures are for you.
The chocolate and water's for me.

208
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,519
I just didn't feel like getting up.

209
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,648
Okay. I'm gonna show you
a picture of Ross, okay...

210
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:59,194
...and you're going to remember
all the bad things about him, all right?

211
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,821
- Really focus on his flaws.
- I can do that.

212
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,532
Certainly did that
while we were going out. Heh.

213
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,867
Okay. Mm.

214
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,370
Before we get started, I just wanna say,
for the record, I love Ross.

215
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,289
I think he's such a great guy.

216
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,338
Okay. Now close your eyes.

217
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,674
- And imagine that you're with Ross.
- Mm-hm.

218
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,677
- Okay, and imagine that you're kissing him.
- Mm-hm.

219
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,889
You're running your hands
all over his body.

220
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,600
And then you run your hands
through his hair...

221
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:34,813
...but, oh, ew, gross,
it's some kind of grease, it's... Ugh.

222
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,065
Ah?

223
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,068
I don't know.

224
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,987
I don't know,
his hair never bothered me that much.

225
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,825
And you know, it was always more crunchy
than it was greasy.

226
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:50,036
Okay. This is gonna be harder
than I thought.

227
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,206
Um, ahem.
Let's try some aversion therapy.

228
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,958
- Okay. All right.
- Okay? All right.

229
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,417
- Look at the picture.
- Okay.

230
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,419
All right, and, um...

231
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,548
Ow!

232
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,972
- Okay. How do you feel now?
- Well, I like you less.

233
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:25,113
- Hey.
- Hey.

234
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,620
- Oh. Sorry.
- No, no, you know what? I'm sorry.

235
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,039
I shouldn't have said
you were embarrassing me.

236
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,499
That really wasn't cool.

237
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:40,795
And if it makes you feel any better,
I've had a really lousy day.

238
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,381
Me too.

239
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,258
- Yeah?
- No!

240
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,678
I had the best day ever.

241
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,682
Dude, check this out.

242
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,268
- Hey.
- Shh, shh, shh.

243
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,230
Say hi to my friend
and tell him you like my hat.

244
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,442
- Okay, so, what's your friend's name?
- Oh. Chandler.

245
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,693
Hi, Chandler.

246
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,653
That's... That's...

247
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,156
- Oh, my God.
- That's Fergie, baby!

248
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,329
Joey says you don't really like his hat,
but I think it's kind of dashing.

249
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,289
When did you...? How...?

250
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,167
I was trying to figure out
how to get to Buckingham Palace.

251
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,710
So I'm in my map and...

252
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,046
Hey.

253
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,505
- Hey.
- Hey.

254
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,758
I understand you had a little talk
with Emily.

255
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,594
Ha, ha. Yes, I did.

256
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,305
And you are welcome.

257
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,266
Am I?

258
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,811
And was it your idea
to postpone the wedding?

259
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,606
Um...

260
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,525
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- Wait up.

261
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:50,531
Hey, hey, since you're the fix-it lady,
here's a pickle:

262
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:54,953
What do you do when the bride says
she doesn't wanna have the wedding at all?

263
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,246
- She said that?
- Yeah.

264
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,831
- Why?
- I don't know.

265
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,710
I told her it was stupid to put off the
wedding just because the hall was gone...

266
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,004
...and she, like, flipped out.

267
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,591
Oh, my God.
You're even dumber than I am.

268
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,719
Excuse me?

269
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,889
Ross, how long
have you been planning this wedding?

270
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,182
I don't know. A month?

271
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,769
Emily has probably been planning it
since she was 5.

272
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,439
Ever since the first time she took
a pillowcase and hung it off her head.

273
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,276
That's what we did.

274
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,697
We dreamed about the perfect wedding.

275
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,574
In the perfect place.

276
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,911
With the perfect four-tiered wedding cake.

277
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,539
With the little people on top.

278
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,926
But the most important part...

279
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,679
...is that we had the perfect guy...

280
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,766
...who understood just how important
all that other stuff was.

281
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,937
I had no idea.

282
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:08,026
That pillowcase thing, I thought you guys
were just doing The Flying Nun.

283
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,155
Sometimes we were.

284
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,742
Come on.

285
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,785
You gotta help me figure out what to do.

286
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:18,995
- Okay?
- All right.

287
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,580
Come on.

288
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,211
- Whoa. Pretty intense, huh?
- Yeah.

289
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:32,425
I hope Ross didn't think we went in there
because we were uncomfortable out here.

290
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,224
I hope he did.

291
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,318
- Hello?
- Hey, Pheebs, it's Joey.

292
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,862
Hey, Joey. Hey. Ooh, ooh.

293
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,865
I just saw someone that looks just like you
on the subway.

294
00:17:56,033 --> 00:18:00,495
I was gonna go over and say hi, but then
I figured he doesn't care he looks like you.

295
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,540
That just cost me 4 bucks.

296
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,544
I just called to see how the chick
and the duck are doing.

297
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,797
They're having a great time
with Aunt Phoebe.

298
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,382
Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all.

299
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,593
So do you miss me?

300
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,596
Kind of,
but I've just been having way too much fun.

301
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,264
Oh, so you're not homesick yet?

302
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,893
No, I don't think so.

303
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,395
All right, well, the seven of us miss you.

304
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,318
- Who's seven?
- Well, you know, me, Rachel...

305
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,861
...the birds, the babies.

306
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,697
Aw, the babies miss me?

307
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,494
- Ooh, pizza guy's here.
- What? You ordered pizza without me?

308
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:46,165
Yeah, but we were thinking about you.
We ordered the Joey Special.

309
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,000
Two pizzas?

310
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:53,798
- Yeah. Okay, gotta go. Talk to you later.
- Wait, wait. Where did you get it from?

311
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,683
Where everybody knows your name

312
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:09,397
And they're always glad you came

313
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:15,528
You wanna be where you can see
The troubles are all the same

314
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:19,532
You wanna be
Where everybody knows your name

315
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:28,332
- Monica, why have you brought me here?
- You'll see.

316
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,460
I tell you,
this wedding is not gonna happen.

317
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,839
Oh, Ross.

318
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:41,512
Okay? But imagine a lot more lights, okay,
and, you know, fewer bricks...

319
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,598
...and flowers and candles.

320
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,601
Okay, and the musicians,
they can go over here, okay?

321
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,061
And the chairs,
they can face this way and...

322
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,230
You go.

323
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,817
But if you don't love this,
then we'll do it any other place...

324
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,027
...any other time.

325
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,447
Really, it's fine. Whatever you want.

326
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,742
It's perfect.

327
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:07,163
- And, I don't know, if it starts to rain...
- Well, then we'll get wet.

328
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,293
Aw.

329
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,962
I don't even have a date.

330
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,133
- Pheebs?
- Yeah?

331
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,344
Do you remember where the duck food is?

332
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,263
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment,
under the sink. Why?

333
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,474
Because I'm going to London.

334
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,893
What? What do you mean,
you're going to London?

335
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,020
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.

336
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,815
Now, honey, you take care, and you don't
have those babies till I get back. Mwah.

337
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,735
Rachel, you can't go. Ross loves Emily.

338
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,988
I know, I know, I know he does,
but I have to tell him how I feel.

339
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:45,451
He deserves to have all of the information.
Then he can make an informed decision.

340
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,829
That's not why you're going.
You're going because you hope he'll say:

341
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:52,792
"Yeah, I love you too, Rach.
Forget about that British chippie."

342
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,211
Do you think he will?

343
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:59,173
No, because he's in love
with the British chippie.

344
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:04,720
Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna
mess with his head and ruin his wedding.

345
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,515
You know? It's too late.
You missed your chance.

346
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,476
I'm sorry. I know this must be really hard.

347
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,146
But it's over.

348
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,945
You know what? No.
It's not over until someone says "I do."

349
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,699
I do. I do! I do!

350
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,791
Yeah, like I can really chase you.
I'm carrying a litter.
