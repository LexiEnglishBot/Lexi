00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,050
Hello!

2
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:11,844
What's this?

3
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:15,097
Oh, right!
It's that girl's phone number.

4
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,936
There it is.
Just a phone number...

5
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,023
...a really hot girl gave me.

6
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:29,862
No big deal. I mean,
it is her home phone number but...

7
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:35,701
Whoa!

8
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,749
Whoops! Heh. Almost lost this baby!

9
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:46,962
The lovely Amanda gives me her number,
and I go and drop it.

10
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,222
Thank you.

11
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,190
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

12
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,943
- When's your birthday?
- May 5th. Why?

13
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,529
I'm making a list of birthdays.

14
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,365
- Mine's December...
- Yeah, whatever.

15
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,037
Oh! She's pretty!

16
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,958
Pretty, uh, pretty girl. The pretty...
She's pretty.

17
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,545
- Go ask her out.
- Ha, ha.

18
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,881
- What's the worst that could happen?
- I could die.

19
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,884
Yeah, it's tough being single.

20
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:19,304
That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.

21
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,891
Ross, you guys went out once.

22
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:27,437
You took your kids to Chuck E. Cheese,
and you didn't even kiss her.

23
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,402
I tell people secrets.

24
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,195
It makes them like me.

25
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,075
Hey.

26
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,619
Phoebe.

27
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,789
You're sick.
You shouldn't play. Go home.

28
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,791
But I'm unemployed.

29
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,627
My music is all I really have now.

30
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,756
Well, music and making my own shoes.
Pretty, huh?

31
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,471
All right, I'll do it.

32
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,515
I'll go get shot down.

33
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,434
Any advice?

34
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,977
Just be yourself...

35
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,146
...but not too much.

36
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,441
Wish me luck.

37
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,234
Good luck!

38
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,156
Wish it!

39
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:24,828
Hi. I was just sitting over there and...

40
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,289
Uh, my name's Chandler.
Did I say that?

41
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,666
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.

42
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,127
- Kathy with a K or a C?
- With a K.

43
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,670
Hey!

44
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,799
Wow, you are really good at this!

45
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,968
I'm out on a limb here!

46
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,137
I'm sorry. You're right.

47
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,806
But I should tell you
I'm waiting for a date.

48
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,517
And there he is now!

49
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,353
- Hey!
- Hey!

50
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,146
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

51
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,815
- I see you guys already met.
- Yeah.

52
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,193
I was trying to demonstrate...

53
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,862
...how I could get my
very large feet...

54
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,323
...into my even bigger mouth.

55
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,992
Didn't I tell you?

56
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,495
Always showing off.

57
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,291
Before I start, I want to say
that I have a cold.

58
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:15,671
So if I sneeze during a song,
it's not on purpose.

59
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,007
Oh! Except the last verse of
"Pepper People."

60
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:26,431
Smelly cat, smelly cat

61
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,601
What are they feeding you?

62
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,021
This chick sounds good.

63
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,107
Smelly cat

64
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:40,070
Gunther, be a good little boy
and bring me a whiskey.

65
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,954
- Hi.
- Hi.

66
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,417
At 2:30 a.m., I didn't expect
to fight over the remote.

67
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,337
Sorry, there's this Ernie Kovacs
thing I wanted to watch.

68
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,214
That's why I got up too.

69
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,216
You're kidding? I love him!

70
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,431
Sorry about this afternoon.
If I'd known, I wouldn't have...

71
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,057
Oh, please. Heh.

72
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,395
Joey tells me you two met
in acting class.

73
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:17,566
We were partners.
Joey picked three scenes for us.

74
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,569
- All of them had us making out.
- Ha-ha-ha.

75
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,072
That's good, because he used to
make me rehearse with him.

76
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,243
- Oh, oh, oh!
- Is it on?

77
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,620
No, but this wonder broom is amazing!

78
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,872
Hey!

79
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,959
Oh, my God!

80
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,628
Oh! It's on!

81
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,096
Here we go, little fella.

82
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,599
What about the duck?

83
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,642
- The duck can swim.
- Of course.

84
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,482
My sticky shoes

85
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,943
My sticky, sticky shoes

86
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,197
Why you stick on me?

87
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,324
Baby

88
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,703
Thanks for the lights, honey.

89
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,458
Way to go!

90
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,627
Your cold makes you sound great.

91
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,797
It's fun.
God, I love how sexy I am!

92
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,638
Kath, we should get going.
We're going to buy hamsters.

93
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,473
- Aw.
- I love them.

94
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:36,019
No, it's not like that.
I work for a medical researcher.

95
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,148
- Have fun.
- Okay.

96
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,984
It's nice that
the medical community...

97
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,195
...is trying to help sick hamsters.

98
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,033
- You know, I like Kathy.
- Yeah?

99
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,245
Me too!
She's so cool and pretty.

100
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,496
She is.

101
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,998
She's smart and funny.

102
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:01,503
We were up all last night talking.
She said the funniest thing about...

103
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,963
What?

104
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,174
You love her.

105
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,218
No, I don't.

106
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,846
Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.

107
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:16,351
- Come on, just lay off him.
- Thank you.

108
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:20,230
He's a little sensitive right now
because he's so in love!

109
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,023
All right.

110
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,694
Ooh, Kathy!

111
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,362
Kathy, I love you!

112
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:42,002
I need to write some depressing stuff
for my new bluesy voice.

113
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,713
But nothing sad has
ever happened to me.

114
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,007
How about your mom dying?

115
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,926
Or living on the streets
when you were 14?

116
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:51,928
Uh-huh.

117
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,558
I could write about when
my hair did that woo-hoo thing.

118
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,563
- Hey.
- Hey.

119
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,232
I'm going over to Amanda's tonight.

120
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,109
- Rachel's not here.
- Oh.

121
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,739
How's it going with her?

122
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,784
Great, actually. I'm thinking
tonight may be the night.

123
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:18,914
The kids will play together,
and when they're asleep...

124
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:22,042
...Amanda and I break
open a bottle of wine...

125
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,253
...do a little playing ourselves.

126
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,342
Hi, guys! This is Josh.

127
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,135
Josh, these are my friends.

128
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,095
And that's Ross.

129
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,932
- Hi, Josh.
- Hi.

130
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,433
Dudes.

131
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,268
You played in college?

132
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:44,147
Aw, I still do.
Next year, I hope to make varsity.

133
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,360
Didn't you play soccer
in high school?

134
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:53,073
No, wait. You organized their
game schedules on your Commodore 64.

135
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:58,286
It's getting late. I got to get
to the game, so I'll... head.

136
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,126
I'll miss you.

137
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,628
Dope!

138
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,801
Wow! Cute one.

139
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,303
- Very cute.
- I know. Isn't he great?

140
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:19,975
So nice to finally be in a
fun relationship, you know?

141
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,394
There's nothing boring about him.

142
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,854
I bet he's never set foot
in a museum.

143
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,856
Maybe he'll get to go soon.

144
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,651
Like on a class trip or something.

145
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,905
You know what else is
great about him?

146
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,116
Ugh, what's the word for an adult...

147
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,910
...who has no dinosaur toys
in their bedroom?

148
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,620
Oh...

149
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,668
What was that?

150
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,003
Monica knows.

151
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,840
It's this dumb thing Ross made up
to fool our parents.

152
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,635
It's a way of giving the finger
without actually giving it.

153
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,140
I cried the night you made that up.

154
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:04,185
It was the first time I realized
I was cooler than my big brother.

155
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,732
I'm going to go get ready...

156
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:16,031
...for my date tonight...

157
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,033
...so I'll just head.

158
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,788
I should go too.
I'm playing in one hour.

159
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,040
Hey...

160
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,960
You guys should come hear me. Ooh!

161
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,420
Hear me. Ooh!

162
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,589
My sticky shoes

163
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,507
Ew! Ew!

164
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,262
I lost my sexy phlegm!

165
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,936
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi, Ben.

166
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,564
- You look great!
- Thanks.

167
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,066
Yeah, okay...

168
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,901
Hey, Tommy!

169
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,403
I'm so glad you could come tonight.

170
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,782
Oh, no. It's my pleasure.

171
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,701
My cell phone number
is on the counter.

172
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,079
Help yourself to the fridge.

173
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,457
I appreciate this.
I've been trying to date...

174
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,250
...this guy for a month.

175
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,086
I...

176
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,797
Uh, I'd appreciate it
if you'd drink your wine...

177
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,299
...after the kids are asleep.

178
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,971
Oh, uh...

179
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,767
Thanks for this. I hope I can do
the same for you sometime.

180
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,735
Who wants to make
some long-distance calls?

181
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,788
Kathy! Kathy!

182
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,083
Hi, Kathy! Kathy!

183
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,635
Kathy!

184
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,850
Fetch! Fetch it!

185
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,313
Kathy! Kathy!

186
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:26,161
Kathy!

187
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,414
Hey. Chandler, what are you doing here?

188
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,917
I just wanted to say, "hey!"

189
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,005
- Hey!
- Okay.

190
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,222
You're making it sound
worse than it was.

191
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,683
Her date tipped me $10!

192
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,731
What are you doing?

193
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:58,443
I want to be sexy again,
so I'm trying to catch a cold.

194
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,612
Should be easy.
They're pretty common.

195
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,239
You'll catch pneumonia!

196
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,746
You were right.
I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.

197
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,414
- What?
- Are you serious?

198
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,917
How's that possible?
You barely know her.

199
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,877
I don't know. I just...

200
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,379
I can't get her out of my head.

201
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,800
I'm a very bad person.
I'm a very, very bad person.

202
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,968
I'm a horrible person.

203
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,431
"No, you're not.
We still love you, Chandler!"

204
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,979
Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.

205
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,440
You mean you stole it!

206
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,403
Don't cover your mouth
when you do that!

207
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,824
Hey.

208
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,493
We were just talking about you.

209
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,870
Really?

210
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,498
The time you got drunk
and fell asleep...

211
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,958
...with your head in the toilet.

212
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,461
Right in there!

213
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,843
Ninety-nine...

214
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,513
...a hundred.
Ready or not, here I come!

215
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,977
Let's go over the concept
one more time.

216
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,979
- Hey!
- Hey!

217
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,941
You want to get some dinner
with me and Kathy tonight?

218
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,528
Oh, um... You know what? I already ate.

219
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,741
- It's 4:30.
- I had a big meal on Monday.

220
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,494
So that'll get me
straight through the week.

221
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,956
I see what's going on here.

222
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,376
- You do?
- Yeah.

223
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,128
You don't like Kathy.

224
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,922
You got me.

225
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,384
You've been avoiding her
since we started dating.

226
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,761
I made an effort to like Janice.

227
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:53,474
Now you make an effort to like Kathy
by going out with us. Right?

228
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,644
- Yeah, right.
- Good. And hey, my treat.

229
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,814
Because you're not eating, right?

230
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,357
Right.

231
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,572
Ross isn't here.

232
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,450
Oh. Stop it!

233
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,580
I'll see you at the party?

234
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:19,208
Beer's fear, man! 24/7!

235
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,419
Yeah!

236
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,591
I am so going to marry that guy.

237
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,887
- Ugh!
- What?

238
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,056
I think he's stealing from me.

239
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,307
Why?

240
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,185
Because he's stealing from me!

241
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,687
- Hi, it's me.
- Hi.

242
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,022
And soup.

243
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,734
I saw Josh. He looked yummy
in your leather jacket.

244
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,533
I don't eat chicken,
so it's just noodle soup.

245
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:57,789
There's no chicken in the broth,
so it's really noodle water.

246
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,960
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

247
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,380
What are you doing?

248
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,467
I need your germs.
I want my cold back.

249
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,095
I miss my sexy voice.

250
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,305
Sorry, Phoebe.

251
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,182
It's okay.

252
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:19,227
- How's the soup?
- Mm.

253
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,996
Oh! Check it out!
You can see that girl's underwear.

254
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,248
- Is she great, or what?
- Ha, ha.

255
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,166
Huh? What do you think?

256
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,586
She's not really my type.

257
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,506
Not your type? She's gorgeous.

258
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,218
You know what it is?
The fishnet stockings.

259
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,680
Whenever I see a girl in those,
it reminds me of...

260
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,932
...my father in fishnet stockings.

261
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:03,062
Understanding a little more of
why you're single.

262
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:06,941
I have a friend you'd like.
We could double date.

263
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,277
No, thanks.

264
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:13,573
I've got some ugly friends
who are available too.

265
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,367
I'm going to grab a beer.

266
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,120
I'll be right back.

267
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,587
- What was that?
- What?

268
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,174
Kathy's being really nice
and you walked away.

269
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,217
What do you want from me?

270
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,094
I want you to like her.

271
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:39,223
If that's too damn difficult,
then at least you could pretend.

272
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,808
I am pretending.

273
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,393
Then do it better.

274
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:46,439
What do you say, I go tell her
how much I like her?

275
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,358
I could tell her
I've been thinking of her.

276
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,944
I haven't stopped thinking
of her since we met.

277
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,156
I'm so over-the-top,
want-to-slit-my-own-throat...

278
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,367
...in love with her,
that every minute...

279
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:02,497
...I can't believe my own damn bad luck
that you met her first!

280
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,373
That's pretty good.

281
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,421
But you might want
to tone it down a little.

282
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:19,847
Hey. Uh, Amanda just dropped me off.

283
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,683
That's one of the things
I love about her.

284
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,936
She's old enough to drive.

285
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,024
You're not going
to Mom and Dad's tonight?

286
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,526
No. Sorry.

287
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,361
Where's Amanda?

288
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,113
Get me some cough drops.

289
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,573
I'm thinking you could bring her...

290
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,119
...and go to your old room
and not make out.

291
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,788
Cough drop, please?

292
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,332
At least she's not
going out with me...

293
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,584
...to get into R-rated movies.

294
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,338
Why don't you marry her?

295
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:56,259
Wait, you can't! I forgot.
She's not a lesbian.

296
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,263
Amanda and I...

297
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,140
You have nothing!

298
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,102
You're not even going out!
You're her babysitter.

299
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,438
You have a 12-year-old girl's job!

300
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,823
Oh, that is so sad.

301
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:24,328
What are you laughing at,
Miss My-keg-sucking-boyfriend...

302
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,122
...- is-stealing-from me?

303
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,335
So he stole a few bucks.
Big deal!

304
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,421
He got me something with it.

305
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,298
That's mine!

306
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:41,971
Would you both please
start acting like adults?

307
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,682
And give me my cough drops!

308
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,394
- Fine.
- Sorry.

309
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,938
- Here.
- Thank you.

310
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,360
At least I made $10 in my relationship.

311
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,697
You know...

312
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,207
Parading goats are parading

313
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,500
Parading down the street

314
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,962
Parading goats are parading

315
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,132
Leaving little treats

316
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,802
Does it even work
without my sexy voice?

317
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,471
I like it.

318
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,642
- Gunther, kiss me.
- What?

319
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,817
Do it, Deputy! Do something!

320
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:46,994
Hey!

321
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:53,084
We aren't exactly sleeping in here,
but do you mind?

322
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,511
Can I sleep on your couch?

323
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,650
And I'm still waiting

324
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,319
For my papier-mâché man

325
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,199
Thank you, my babies.

326
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,539
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

327
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:36,127
Did you hear what happened
between me and Phoebe?

328
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,546
- No.
- We kissed.

329
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,550
I didn't initiate it,
but I also didn't stop it.

330
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,468
I've been feeling guilty.

331
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:48,889
Okay

332
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,850
So, um...

333
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,727
...are we cool?

334
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,898
Okay.

335
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,068
I knew you would understand.
