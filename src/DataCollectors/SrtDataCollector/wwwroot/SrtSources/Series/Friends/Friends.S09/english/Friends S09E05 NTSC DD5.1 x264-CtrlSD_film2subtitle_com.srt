1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:02,896
Oh, hey, you guys?

2
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:05,867
l couldn't get a reservation
for the night of my birthday...

3
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:08,199
...so we'll have to do dinner
Thursday night.

4
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:13,311
-Thursday? But that's Halloween.
-So?

5
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:15,806
lt's just spooky, that's all.

6
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:18,579
So, is Mike coming to dinner?

7
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:22,551
No. lt's my first birthday
with a boyfriend, and he has to work.

8
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:26,749
l'd get mad at him, but l think
it's too soon to show my true colors.

9
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,987
l would make the reservation for five.
One of us has to stay with Emma.

10
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,258
-Which one of us should go to dinner?
-Rachel!

11
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:40,697
Actually, l was thinking
maybe both of us could go.

12
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:46,507
Thanks. l'll put a lot of extra thought
into your gift.

13
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:50,109
All right, so great, we can all go now.

14
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:52,751
That is fun! Hey! You know what?

15
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:56,616
We all haven't been together,
the six of us, in such a long time.

16
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,018
What are you talking about?
We're together now.

17
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,819
Mon? Chandler's not here.

18
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:06,965
Oh, dear God.

19
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,285
Hello. lt's nice to see
our team together for the first time.

20
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,853
Now, before we get started,
are there any questions?

21
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,785
-Yes. Ken, is it?
-That's right.

22
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,325
ls it true the reason you're in Tulsa is,
you fell asleep in a meeting...

23
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:12,090
...and took the job without realizing
what you were saying yes to?

24
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,560
Well, don't believe
everything you hear, Ken.

25
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,294
But yeah, that's true.

26
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:25,008
All right, let's get started by taking
a look at last quarter's figures.

27
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:30,513
Claudia, aren't you supposed
to blow smoke up the boss's ass?

28
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:37,053
-l'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
-No. l smoked for years. Then l quit.

29
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,657
Right now, l can't remember why.

30
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,658
You're not allowed to smoke
in this office, right?

31
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:46,423
Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke
in offices with 1 5 people or less.

32
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,830
-Would you like one?
-Would Joey like two pizzas?

33
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,766
You don't know what l'm talking about.

34
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,206
All right, look. l don't smoke anymore.

35
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:00,674
But if the rest of you want to light up,
go ahead, it's fine.

36
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,482
So, you all smoke, then?

37
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,713
You know, it's almost rude
that l'm not smoking.

38
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,322
-That's not true. lf you don't want--
-Ken, please!

39
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,688
No, l can't. l can't smoke.
lf l smoke, my wife would kill me.

40
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,162
l'm sorry, but isn't your wife
back in New York?

41
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,171
l've always liked you, Ken.

42
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,308
Trick or treat.

43
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,713
-Hey.
-And ''treat'' it is.

44
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,716
Wow. So glad l changed.

45
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:47,089
l almost wore my threadbare robe
that can't contain my breasts.

46
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,455
This is not what l'm wearing.
l'm ovulating...

47
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:55,032
...and Chandler's gonna be home. So,
l thought we would try before dinner.

48
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,265
Oh, l thought we'd all
go over together.

49
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,998
All right, l'll just meet you there
at dinner.

50
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:05,838
Unless, l mean, if it helps,
l could stay and watch.

51
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,680
-No!
-Well, l didn't want to anyway.

52
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:13,376
You know, just thought
l'd be polite and offer.

53
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,017
Wait, does this mean you'll be late?

54
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,090
We haven't seen each other
in over a week.

55
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,090
We'll probably be the first ones there.

56
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,060
Okay. See you there. Happy humping.

57
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,932
Hey. Well, hey!

58
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,496
Wow, somebody smoked out here?

59
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,132
My God, don't people know you're
not allowed to smoke in public spaces?

60
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:43,509
Actually, in Oklahoma smoking's legal
in offices with fewer than 1 5 people.

61
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,513
Oh, you smoked.

62
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:50,451
No. l just happen to know a lot of trivia
about smoking in different states.

63
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:55,219
For example, in Hawaii,
cigarettes are called <i>lei-lana-lukus.</i>

64
00:04:56,596 --> 00:05:01,124
-Oh, Chandler, you stink of cigarettes!
-Do you think Monica will smell it?

65
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,826
Are you kidding? That woman
has the nose of a bloodhound.

66
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,439
And the breasts of a Greek goddess.

67
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,971
Pheebs?

68
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,774
l'm gonna go.

69
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,945
Okay. Something to cover the smell.

70
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,492
Oven cleaner.

71
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,568
Unscented.

72
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,694
Welcome home.

73
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,702
l've missed you.

74
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:48,438
-You want to join me in the bedroom?
-No, thanks, l'm good.

75
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:53,317
Okay. So you want to play it
that way, do you?

76
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,213
Well, you know what, actually,
l just got off a plane...

77
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,720
...so l'm feeling gross.
l should take a shower.

78
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,689
-Come here, you don't need a shower.
-All right, the truth is...

79
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,729
...l soiled myself
during some turbulence.

80
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,799
What do l smell? l smell smoke.

81
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:15,133
Did you smoke?

82
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,175
Yes. But l just had one.

83
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,811
Two.

84
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,709
Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five.

85
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:28,319
A pack. Two pack-- A carton.

86
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,979
Three big fat cartons in two days!

87
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,751
But it's over. l've made a decision,
l'm not gonna smoke anymore.

88
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,566
Well, those are for you.

89
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:47,337
All right. Well, we'll just see you
when you get here. Bye.

90
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:51,142
Oh, that was my mom.
She's stuck in terrible traffic.

91
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,074
That is now the third sign
that l should not leave Emma.

92
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,306
-What are the other two?
-Well, the first one is, l don't want to.

93
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,941
And second one, l'm not going.

94
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,712
l know this is the first time
we're leaving the baby.

95
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,915
l know how hard it is for you. But....

96
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,220
But everything's gonna be fine.
l mean, my mom is gonna be with her.

97
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,556
-She's great with kids.
-She is?

98
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,858
Yeah.

99
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,600
What about Monica?

100
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:19,898
You only hear Monica's side of that.
Okay, that little fatso was a terror!

101
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:27,270
-l just don't think l can do it.
-Know what? You can and you should.

102
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,448
Really, it will be good for you.

103
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,082
ln fact, you know what?

104
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,912
Go ahead to the restaurant,
and l will wait for my mom...

105
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:37,783
...and then l'll meet you there.
No, no, really, you should go. Go out.

106
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:44,487
Really, the world is your oyster.
Kick up your heels. Paint the town red!

107
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:49,734
-You need to learn some new slang.
-l'm serious. Come on, you should go.

108
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,769
Here. No, just go.

109
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,907
-Well--
-No, no! You know what?

110
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:59,067
You're not getting back in there!
The baby's fine. Now, scram!

111
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,009
Yeah, hit the bricks!

112
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,013
Tell your story walking!

113
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,216
l was just going to say
that l left my keys.

114
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,091
Holy moley, are we in a pickle now!

115
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,966
Where is everyone?
They're 40 minutes late.

116
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,137
-l know.
-l'm starving.

117
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,001
l knew we were coming here tonight.
l ate nothing all day.

118
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,335
What about me?
l only had one lunch today.

119
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,012
So, are we expecting
the rest of our party shortly?

120
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,581
Yes, they are expected presently.
Yeah.

121
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:42,346
Their arrival is in the offing.

122
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,813
Right. We have a table for two available.

123
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,652
-Perhaps you'd--
-No, they're coming.

124
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,316
We're waiting right here.

125
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,253
Joseph!

126
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,960
One needn't worry.
They shan't be long.

127
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:59,738
lt's just that we do have
some large parties waiting.

128
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,840
Oh, one really does have a stick
up one's ass, doesn't one?

129
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:09,744
Why would you start smoking again?
lt's so bad for you.

130
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,647
lt's only been two days.
That's not enough time to--

131
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,619
That's totally unrelated.

132
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,852
How can you smoke in this day and age?
Have you not seen that ad?

133
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,860
Where the little kid walks
through Grandpa? lt's chilling!

134
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,865
l messed up. lt was a meeting.
Everybody was smoking.

135
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,195
So what? Don't you have any willpower?

136
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,305
Willpower? l've watched home movies
of you eating Ding Dongs...

137
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,304
...without taking the tinfoil off!

138
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,978
You said that was sexy!

139
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:46,410
Okay, look, can we just drop this?
l'm not gonna smoke again.

140
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,111
That's right, because l forbid you
to smoke again.

141
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,313
You forbid me?

142
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,787
l've flown a long way
to see my loving wife.

143
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,894
ls she here, by the way?

144
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:02,056
Chandler, don't joke with me. Okay?
l'm very, very upset right now.

145
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,260
-ls this the most upset you could be?
-l think so.

146
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,564
Well, then l might as well...

147
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,832
...do this.

148
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,649
Not really sure what to do now.

149
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,447
l'll tell you what we're gonna do.

150
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,186
We're already late
for Phoebe's birthday dinner.

151
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,353
So you're going to put out
that cigarette...

152
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,294
...we're gonna put this fight on hold,
and go have sex.

153
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,491
Fine. What?

154
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,130
What, do you have
cigarettes in your ears?

155
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,706
Sex! This is the last day l'm ovulating.
lf we don't do it...

156
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,037
...we're gonna have to wait
until next month!

157
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,703
You're serious?

158
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:52,373
-Oh, yeah!
-All right, fine, l'll do it, but no talking!

159
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,553
-And no cuddling.
-And no kissing your neck.

160
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:59,213
Oh, good! l hate it when you do that!

161
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,157
And lots of kissing your neck!

162
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,792
Okay, well, the super's not home.

163
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,560
But my mother's gonna be here,
and she has the key.

164
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:13,000
l can't wait that long. You have to do
something. Knock that door down!

165
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,367
l would, but l bruise like a peach.

166
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:21,679
Besides, you know, everything's
gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping.

167
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:26,112
-What if she jumps out of the bassinet?
-Can't hold her head up, but jumped.

168
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,120
Oh, my God!
l left the water running!

169
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:33,156
You did not leave the water running.
Please, pull yourself together, okay?

170
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:37,658
-Well, did l leave the stove on?
-You haven't cooked since 1 996.

171
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:41,622
ls the window open? lf the window's
open a bird could fly in and....

172
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,826
My God, you know what?
l think you're right.

173
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,300
-Listen.
-What? What?

174
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:49,908
A pigeon. No. No, wait, no.
An eagle flew in!

175
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,978
Landed on the stove and caught fire!

176
00:11:56,182 --> 00:12:02,121
The baby, seeing this, jumps across
the apartment to the mighty bird's aid.

177
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:05,223
The eagle, however, misconstrues this
as an act of aggression...

178
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,119
...and grabs the baby in its talon.

179
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:10,524
Meanwhile, the faucet
fills the apartment with water.

180
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:14,188
Baby and bird, still ablaze,
are locked in a death grip...

181
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:19,201
...swirling around the whirlpool
that fills the apartment!

182
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,072
Boy, are you gonna be sorry
if that's true.

183
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,442
-Hello.
-Hi.

184
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,548
lt's been an hour.

185
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:35,710
The maitre d' asked if you'd reconsider
switching to a smaller table.

186
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,511
Maybe we should just eat now.

187
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,319
You can't order until the entire
party's arrived. Restaurant policy.

188
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,428
Well, how about this?
Another table leaves, right...

189
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,657
...but there's still some food left
on their plates.

190
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:51,269
Okay, what's the restaurant's policy
about people eating that?

191
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,405
-lt's frowned upon.
-But it happens.

192
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,468
-All right, l got to go to the bathroom.
-You can't go.

193
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,841
No, no, no.
l can't hold this table on my own.

194
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,040
lf they ask me to move, l'll cave.

195
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,219
Well, if you ask me to stay, l'll pee.

196
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,850
Good evening, miss.

197
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,754
Miss?

198
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,132
Miss? Miss?

199
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:27,898
Okay, fine, l'll move. All right.
You don't have to manhandle me.

200
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:32,400
-Where?
-Okay.

201
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:36,177
Thank you. Wow.

202
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,248
Will you stop staring at us now?

203
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:42,786
That depends. Will your friend stop
drinking olive oil directly from the bottle?

204
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,116
Probably not.

205
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,964
Finally. You guys made it.

206
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,305
Pheebs, who the hell--?

207
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,221
What is taking you so long,
Come on, let's get it over with!

208
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,759
ln a minute, sweet cakes.

209
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:24,829
Spend more time with the tie!
That will make a baby.

210
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:29,931
Look, l can't do this. l can't make love
to you while we're fighting this way.

211
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,433
Oh, sure. Now you're Mr. Sensitivity.

212
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,267
But when you wanted to have sex
after my uncle's funeral--

213
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,567
That was a celebration of life!

214
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,875
All right, l'm not gonna do this.

215
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,571
ls this the way you want our baby
to be conceived?

216
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,475
No, you're right.

217
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,921
We shouldn't do it like this.

218
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,788
For what it's worth, l'm sorry.

219
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:59,260
l shouldn't have come down on you
so hard about the smoking.

220
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:03,433
So you had a few cigarettes.
lt's not the end of the world.

221
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,230
-Really?
-Yeah.

222
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,732
You are incredible.

223
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,433
And listen,
l'm not gonna smoke again.

224
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,670
And if l do, l promise
l will hide it so much better from you.

225
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,126
-Want to?
-Let's celebrate life!

226
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,421
Okay!

227
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,124
Oh, God.

228
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,200
Oh, thank God you're okay.

229
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,870
l'm sorry we left.
Mommy will never leave you again.

230
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:42,064
Never, ever, ever again.

231
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,102
Great. So let's get going.

232
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:48,943
l mean it. After what just happened,
l'm never leaving her again.

233
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,912
l understand. Separation is hard.

234
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:56,077
One time l was about to leave Ross
to go to the beauty parlor.

235
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,985
And he got so upset
he took off all his clothes...

236
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,423
...tucked his willy between his legs...

237
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:07,429
...and cried out, ''Mommy, l'm a girl.
Take me with you.''

238
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:19,340
Somehow, over time,
it got easier to be apart from you.

239
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,452
You are welcome.

240
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,851
-You know what? Let's not talk.
-What?

241
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:35,527
-l am still so mad at you for smoking!
-But you said you forgave me.

242
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:38,663
lt was just a couple of cigarettes,
no big deal.

243
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:45,160
l was ovulating and you said you
wouldn't have sex if we were fighting.

244
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:51,771
-You tricked me to get me into bed?
-That's right. l got mine.

245
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,112
l feel so used.

246
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,851
Well, l guess they're not coming.
You want to just order?

247
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,579
Thank you.

248
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,327
Waiter? All right, this is gonna
go fast, so try to keep up.

249
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,794
Risotto with shaved truffles
and the rib steak...

250
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,662
...with the golden chanterelles
and the Bordelaise sauce...

251
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,998
...unless any of that stuff l just said
means ''snails.''

252
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,239
lt does not.

253
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:25,866
Tomato tart, and which of the pastas
would you recommend?

254
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,843
-Oh, well they're both exquisite--
-Both it is. Thank you.

255
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:33,576
Now, let's go, baby.
lt's food time. Bring it, bitch.

256
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:40,523
-Sorry about that.
-lt's quite all right.

257
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,751
Oh, can l make a special request?

258
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,793
Can you bring everything
as it's ready?

259
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,397
-Appetizers, entrées, we don't care.
-Hey!

260
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,435
-l'll wait to put your order in.
-What did l ever do to you?

261
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,697
Nothing, bitch.

262
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,877
You guys are over an hour late.

263
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,207
-What happened to you two?
-So sorry.

264
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,783
-We got locked out of the apartment.
-That's a great story. Can l eat it?

265
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,721
And then Rachel wasn't sure
she could leave the baby.

266
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:14,347
lt wasn't easy, but it's your birthday
and l did what l had to do.

267
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:17,026
And that's Judy over there at the bar
with Emma?

268
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,892
This is for the best. l'm not distracted,
worrying about Emma...

269
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:27,698
...how she's doing at home, and l'm
gonna be completely here with you.

270
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,703
-Oh, she spit up. She spit up.
-What?

271
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,571
Judy? She spit--
Judy, look alive, Judy!

272
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,405
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

273
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:43,252
Oh, everything looks delicious.

274
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:47,222
What should l have?
What should l have?

275
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:51,294
Never hit a woman.
Never hit a woman.

276
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,822
l know what you mean,
this menu's incredible.

277
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,933
Ross bruises like a peach.
He bruises like a peach.

278
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,334
Okay, l'll have the fig salad
and the duck.

279
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,336
l'll have the soup and the salmon.

280
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,509
Remember, whatever comes up first,
okay?

281
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,075
-Hurry--
-Happy birthday!

282
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,473
Son of a bitch!

283
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:11,808
-Where have you been?
-Well, we had a little fight.

284
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,975
l would never lie
to get someone into bed.

285
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,748
You used to tell girls
you were a Kennedy.

286
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,758
Thanks.

287
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:26,026
Thanks. Wow.

288
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:29,065
A little tight, isn't it?
Why didn't you get a bigger table?

289
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:34,463
You had a big table
but they made you move.

290
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,107
Shut up, Monica.

291
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,269
Oh, well, l suppose that Chandler
will have the smoked duck.

292
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:48,780
And l suppose that Monica
will have the manipulative shrew.

293
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,818
How did l miss that?

294
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,315
-l'll give you another minute.
-What, where you going?

295
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,155
He said she wanted the shrew!

296
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,128
Rach, come on, Emma's fine.

297
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:05,497
You're turning into an obsessive
mother, okay? You need to stop.

298
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:10,905
You ever hear the story about when
Ross' mom went to the beauty salon?

299
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:17,114
-You mean the willy story?
-They already know it.

300
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,979
We've been waiting for you
for a long time.

301
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,645
-You should order.
-That's okay.

302
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:27,690
-l told the waiter what they want.
-Why would you do that?

303
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,224
Chandler, control your woman.

304
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,623
Okay, well....
Everybody has ordered.

305
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:40,466
l would like to start the celebration
and make a toast to Phoebe.

306
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:44,006
-She dropped her sock.
-What?

307
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,770
-No. No, Emma dropped her sock.

308
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,435
-How do you know that?
-She's over there.

309
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,980
-Mom's with her.
-Mom's here?

310
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:55,615
l wanted to have lunch with her today.
She told me she was out of town.

311
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,813
She still has not noticed
that the baby's sock is on the ground.

312
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,322
lt's a good toast.

313
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,154
Look, will you please get her attention?

314
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,295
Mommy?

315
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,468
Mother.

316
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,339
Oh, for God's sake, Judy,
pick up the sock!

317
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,608
Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock!

318
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,047
l'm sorry, was that rude?

319
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:37,157
Did my little outburst...

320
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:41,526
...blunt the hideousness
that is this evening?

321
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,632
Look, l know you have a lot going on...

322
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:49,707
...but all l wanted to do was have
dinner with my friends on my birthday.

323
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:55,404
And you are all so late, and you
didn't even have the courtesy to call.

324
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,780
Well, it's too late now.

325
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,676
Pheebs, l don't think that's us.

326
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:07,349
Oh, well, this is-- This is not over!
Hello?

327
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:13,526
l feel terrible. We should've been strong
and left Emma at home.

328
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,030
''We''?

329
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,998
There are some adult willy stories
they don't know.

330
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,638
We should've been stronger.

331
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:24,873
-What is going on with you two?
-Well, you see, l'm ovulating.

332
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,671
Oh, yeah, that's what she says.

333
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:33,474
Maybe you're not ovulating. Maybe
it's a clever ruse to get me into bed.

334
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:38,316
Yeah, Smokey, that's what it was.
l just can't get enough.

335
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,685
You're not gonna believe this.

336
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,191
She tricked me
into having sex with her.

337
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,895
So? You got to have sex, right?

338
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,896
What's the matter with me?
Why am l such a girl?

339
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:58,506
-Okay. That was Mike.
-Oh, Phoebe, honey, we are so sorry.

340
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:01,874
You are totally right.
We are here 1 00 percent...

341
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,414
...and we love you, and we are ready
to start your birthday celebration.

342
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:08,780
You guys, that means the world to me.

343
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,390
Okay, l'm gonna take off.

344
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,622
What?

345
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,228
l love you guys too, but,
Mike got off work early.

346
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,229
Wait.

347
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:25,928
l'm not the-- l'm not the kind of girl
that just ditches her friends...

348
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,368
...to be with her boyfriend.

349
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,870
You know what? l am.

350
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,267
Bye, guys. Judy! Bye.

351
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,444
lf Phoebe's gone,
can we take Emma home?

352
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:41,712
That's a good idea. Our babysitter
just pounded another chardonnay.

353
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,115
-Bye, you guys.
-Bye.

354
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:47,554
See you. Well, l guess it's just us.

355
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:55,132
So, l'm probably still ovulating.
Do you want to give it another try?

356
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,661
All right.

357
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:01,033
So, you've never had sex
with a Kennedy, have you?

358
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,739
Actually, Richard was a Kennedy
on his mother's side.

359
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,675
Why did you break up with that guy?

360
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,177
-You're gonna go do it?
-We don't have much time.

361
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,510
Once the egg descends
into the fallopian tube--

362
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,516
Oh, wait, oh, get out of here!

363
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:23,225
l sincerely hope the rest of your party
is returning.

364
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:25,760
No, just me. All alone.

365
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:33,237
Dinner for six for one.

366
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:37,230
Well, you boys are about
to see something really special.

367
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,846
-How was everything?
-Excellent.

368
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:55,459
The shrew, in particular, was exquisite.

369
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,222
l hope you've got some room left.

370
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,033
Joey. Joey.

371
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,807
This is the best birthday ever!

372
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,675
