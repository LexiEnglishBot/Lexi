1
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:04,677
- Hi.
- Hi! Hi, Ben.

2
00:00:05,135 --> 00:00:07,152
- Hi.
- We have a bathroom emergency.

3
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:08,675
Go ahead.

4
00:00:08,962 --> 00:00:14,347
Before we do, are any of Joey's
special "romance" magazines in there?

5
00:00:16,964 --> 00:00:19,395
- No.
- Okay, all clear.

6
00:00:19,922 --> 00:00:21,416
Thanks, Phoebe.

7
00:00:24,235 --> 00:00:25,172
That's Rachel.

8
00:00:26,114 --> 00:00:27,430
But whatever.

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,472
- Everything okay in there?
- Don't talk to me now.

10
00:00:33,455 --> 00:00:35,507
Just like his daddy.

11
00:00:36,935 --> 00:00:38,595
Could you do me a big favor?

12
00:00:38,918 --> 00:00:41,314
I have a meeting
at the dean's office.

13
00:00:41,597 --> 00:00:43,613
Can you watch Ben for an hour?

14
00:00:44,972 --> 00:00:47,439
- What about Monica?
- She isn't home.

15
00:00:48,276 --> 00:00:51,645
So it would just be me alone?

16
00:00:53,148 --> 00:00:54,464
Ben would be there.

17
00:00:57,984 --> 00:00:59,336
What's the matter?

18
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:03,583
I've never done that before.
Me and him, alone.

19
00:01:04,142 --> 00:01:05,458
He's not an ex-con.

20
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,856
Okay, okay...

21
00:01:08,177 --> 00:01:11,024
- What do I do with him?
- I don't know, talk to him.

22
00:01:11,274 --> 00:01:13,148
Entertain him. Keep him alive.

23
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:17,562
- Okay.
- Ben, come here.

24
00:01:17,884 --> 00:01:21,846
I'm gonna leave you here with
Aunt Rachel for about an hour, okay?

25
00:01:22,094 --> 00:01:23,031
Gonna be okay?

26
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:25,326
- I think so.
- I wasn't talking to you.

27
00:01:27,556 --> 00:01:30,403
- I'll be okay.
- Okay. I'll see you soon, buddy.

28
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:33,156
- Be back in an hour.
- Bye Dad.

29
00:01:39,107 --> 00:01:42,097
- So this is fun, huh?
- Not really.

30
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:49,229
- Okay. Want something to drink?
- Okay.

31
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,978
Great. All right,
how do you feel about Diet Coke?

32
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,797
- I'm not allowed to have soda.
- Okay.

33
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:57,675
Well, that's pretty much all
that we have.

34
00:01:57,895 --> 00:02:00,849
Have you ever had a virgin margarita?

35
00:02:01,513 --> 00:02:03,245
What's a virgin?

36
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:06,726
Water it is.

37
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:12,601
The One With The
Truth About London

38
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,886
What about the second minister?
I kind of liked him.

39
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,167
- You mean the spitter?
- Come on. He wasn't that bad.

40
00:02:56,484 --> 00:02:59,082
Easy for you to say,
you'd be wearing a veil.

41
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,718
- And the third guy?
- He kept staring at your chest.

42
00:03:04,346 --> 00:03:05,734
Can you blame him?

43
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:09,667
I don't like the idea of
me saying, "I do"...

44
00:03:09,948 --> 00:03:11,929
...while he's thinking,
"I'd do it too."

45
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,112
- Well, then we still have a problem.
- With what?

46
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:21,915
We need someone to perform our wedding
but they're all boring or annoying...

47
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,104
...or keep staring at the ladies.

48
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:29,602
You should have one of us do it.

49
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:32,909
We're getting "married" married,
not "6th-grade" married.

50
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:35,474
No, it's a real thing.

51
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:39,273
Anyone can be ordained on the Internet
and perform weddings and stuff.

52
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:43,032
- Are you serious? - A friend
of mine did it. It's totally legal.

53
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:44,702
I call it!

54
00:03:45,784 --> 00:03:47,693
What? It was my idea!

55
00:03:47,907 --> 00:03:51,168
Thank you very much, but neither
of you is marrying us.

56
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:54,300
Does calling it not mean
anything anymore?

57
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,227
We're having a legitimate
clergy member.

58
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:00,047
And when I say legitimate,
I mean gay...

59
00:04:00,362 --> 00:04:02,722
...and in control of his saliva.

60
00:04:04,815 --> 00:04:07,876
- Is that lemon poppy seed?
- You don't want these. They're stale.

61
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:11,311
- I'm leaving them outside for the pigeons.
- I call them!

62
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:26,867
Ben, you know, when you were a baby...

63
00:04:27,673 --> 00:04:29,370
...we'd hang out all the time.

64
00:04:29,657 --> 00:04:31,389
I was your daddy's girlfriend.

65
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:33,820
But you're not anymore.

66
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:38,733
- No, I'm not.
- Because you guys were on a break...

67
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:41,067
Hey, we were not on a...

68
00:04:43,468 --> 00:04:45,022
That's fine.
You know what Ben?

69
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:49,276
One day when you are a lot older,
I'm gonna tell you that entire story...

70
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:52,750
...over a real pitcher
of margaritas. Okay?

71
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,770
- When's my daddy coming back?
- Fifty-two minutes.

72
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:05,386
So no brothers or sisters, huh?

73
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,193
That must be nice.
You don't have to share stuff.

74
00:05:08,414 --> 00:05:09,873
Sharing is good.

75
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:14,838
You're one of those.

76
00:05:15,408 --> 00:05:19,476
You know what, I had two sisters
and we just tortured each other.

77
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:23,435
- Really? Like how?
- Well, you know, we would...

78
00:05:23,722 --> 00:05:26,154
...we'd repeat everything
the other said...

79
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:30,019
...or we'd jump out of closets
to scare each other...

80
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:33,845
...or switch the sugar with salt
so they put salt on their cereal.

81
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:35,437
That's a good one.

82
00:05:37,431 --> 00:05:40,004
- Yeah, you like that one?
- Yeah, you're funny.

83
00:05:40,388 --> 00:05:41,633
I'm funny?

84
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:43,161
Oh, thank God.

85
00:05:44,354 --> 00:05:46,014
Well, hey, I got a ton of these.

86
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:49,011
You want a good one?
Here's a good one.

87
00:05:49,677 --> 00:05:51,658
You take a quarter...

88
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:56,909
...and you blacken the edge, right?

89
00:05:57,226 --> 00:06:00,773
And then you say,
"I bet you can't roll this quarter...

90
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,275
...to your chin without it
leaving your face."

91
00:06:03,524 --> 00:06:08,672
And when they do it, they're left with
a line down the center of their face.

92
00:06:09,056 --> 00:06:10,859
Can I do it to you?

93
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,794
I'm funny, Ben, but I'm not stupid.

94
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,021
So did you find anyone
to marry you yet?

95
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:29,682
No, but "Horny for Monica" minister
called...

96
00:06:29,897 --> 00:06:32,328
...wondering if we're still together.

97
00:06:33,585 --> 00:06:36,052
- We'll never find anybody.
- Then let me do it.

98
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,792
- Joey...
- I've been thinking.

99
00:06:38,003 --> 00:06:40,920
I'm an actor, so I won't
get nervous in front of people.

100
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,078
- Joey, please...
- No, no, no.

101
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:46,731
I won't spit and I won't stare
at Monica's breasts.

102
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,310
Everyone knows I'm an ass man.

103
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:54,075
- That's true.
- The most important thing...

104
00:06:54,354 --> 00:06:57,865
...is, it won't be some stranger
who barely knows you.

105
00:06:58,112 --> 00:07:01,718
It'll be me. And I swear,
I'll do a really good job.

106
00:07:01,974 --> 00:07:05,343
Plus, I love you guys and it
would really mean a lot to me.

107
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:10,732
- Well, we haven't found anybody else.
- Might be kind of cool.

108
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,062
- So I can do it?
- Yeah, you can do it.

109
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:15,605
All right! Okay!

110
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:18,772
Okay, I gotta get started
on my speech.

111
00:07:19,092 --> 00:07:20,337
Wait a minute.

112
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,544
Internet ministers
can have sex, right?

113
00:07:29,077 --> 00:07:33,418
- Hey, Pheebs. How's it going?
- I have a headache. A horrible headache.

114
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:37,941
- I'm sorry. Can I get you something?
- Oh, my God, you've got to stop chattering.

115
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,734
Here, take a couple of these.

116
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,201
- What is it?
- It's Hexedrin.

117
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,602
Oh, no,
I don't believe in Western medicine.

118
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,162
If you just apply pressure
to these points right here...

119
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:55,062
Then your hands starts to hurt and
you still have a headache, so thanks.

120
00:07:57,258 --> 00:08:01,220
While we're waiting for these pills to kick
in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch.

121
00:08:01,468 --> 00:08:04,386
Come on. Get some nice soft pillows
under your head.

122
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:07,481
I'm gonna turn the TV on.
You can watch whatever you want.

123
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:13,116
Sit down. I'm gonna make you some tea,
and then I'm gonna rub your feet.

124
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,212
My head!

125
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:25,325
Coming.

126
00:08:34,137 --> 00:08:36,355
I have a bone to pick with you.

127
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:40,250
- Uh-oh.
- Yes.

128
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:42,865
Ben learned a little trick.

129
00:08:45,514 --> 00:08:48,883
- Oh, did he pull the old...?
- That's right. That's right.

130
00:08:50,385 --> 00:08:53,090
Saran wrap on the toilet seat...

131
00:08:53,342 --> 00:08:56,189
...so the pee goes everywhere.

132
00:08:58,144 --> 00:09:00,255
- Oh, that.
- Yeah, that.

133
00:09:00,684 --> 00:09:02,866
You know I hate practical jokes.

134
00:09:03,224 --> 00:09:07,043
They're mean, they're stupid and
I don't want my son learning them.

135
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:11,634
Saran wrap on the toilet seat?
Isn't that just a little funny?

136
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:13,510
- I was barefoot.
- Oh.

137
00:09:15,018 --> 00:09:17,094
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

138
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,877
You're not laughing with someone,
you're laughing at them.

139
00:09:20,132 --> 00:09:22,149
And laughing at someone is not nice.

140
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,342
So you're one of those too.

141
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:30,253
Tell me, the toilet thing is the
only thing you taught him, right?

142
00:09:34,362 --> 00:09:35,370
Yes.

143
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:41,354
It' amazing.
My headache is completely gone.

144
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:44,897
- What were those pills called?
- Hexedrin.

145
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:47,129
I love you Hexedrin.

146
00:09:48,452 --> 00:09:51,157
Oh, look, it comes with a story.

147
00:09:52,731 --> 00:09:55,329
Phoebe, those are like
the side effects and stuff.

148
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,795
Say what?

149
00:09:57,011 --> 00:09:58,885
You know, the possible side effects.

150
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,079
Oh, my God.

151
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:05,430
"Dizziness. Nervousness. Drowsiness.

152
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,352
Facial swelling. Nausea. Headache..."

153
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:11,303
Headache.

154
00:10:14,442 --> 00:10:17,111
"Vomiting. Stomach bleeding.
Liver damage."

155
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,814
I don't recall any of these coming up when
you gave me these little death capsules.

156
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:26,577
Oh, I'm sorry.
"Extra strength" death capsules.

157
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:30,232
None of that ever happens. They
just put it on there for legal reasons.

158
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:32,178
Why?

159
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,024
In case it happens.

160
00:10:36,118 --> 00:10:39,831
- Hey.
- Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani.

161
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:42,161
- You got ordained?
- Yeah.

162
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,855
Just got off the Internet.
Man, there's a lot of porn out there.

163
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:49,438
Our minister.

164
00:10:49,755 --> 00:10:53,053
I can now officially marry
anybody I want.

165
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:57,397
Hey, you guys seem happy. If you ever
want to get marry, you give me a call.

166
00:10:57,618 --> 00:10:59,979
If not, you give me a call.

167
00:11:03,638 --> 00:11:05,998
I have liver damage.

168
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:10,941
Phoebe, your liver is right here.

169
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:14,387
Okay, well, then I must be disoriented.

170
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:20,333
I started on what I'm gonna say
for the ceremony. Want to hear it?

171
00:11:20,616 --> 00:11:23,736
Listen, this is just
the first draft, so...

172
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,911
"We are gathered here today
on this joyous occasion...

173
00:11:28,235 --> 00:11:32,055
...to celebrate the special love
that Monica and Chandler share.

174
00:11:35,055 --> 00:11:38,150
It is a love based on
giving and receiving...

175
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:40,967
...as well as having and sharing.

176
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:46,218
And the love that they give
and have is shared and received.

177
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:51,051
And through this having and giving...

178
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:54,112
...and sharing and receiving...

179
00:11:56,938 --> 00:12:02,288
...we too can share and love
and have...

180
00:12:02,992 --> 00:12:04,830
...and receive."

181
00:12:07,898 --> 00:12:09,842
Should we call the spitter?

182
00:12:20,075 --> 00:12:23,135
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi.

183
00:12:23,484 --> 00:12:25,845
What a surprise.
What are you doing here?

184
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:29,012
I was just in the neighborhood...

185
00:12:29,294 --> 00:12:32,769
...and I passed by your building and
thought, "What's up with Carol...

186
00:12:33,122 --> 00:12:34,854
...and sweet little Ben?"

187
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:38,512
- That's nice. Well, come on in.
- Okay.

188
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,975
I'll make some coffee
and we can chat.

189
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,996
I'd love that.
I would love that.

190
00:12:45,438 --> 00:12:47,727
So where is sweet little Ben?

191
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:50,099
I would love to have a little...

192
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,238
I found him!

193
00:12:56,327 --> 00:12:58,201
Very funny. Come here.

194
00:12:58,798 --> 00:13:02,167
That is exactly why I've
come here to talk to you, okay?

195
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:04,917
- Rachel, you want sugar?
- Yes, but...

196
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:07,108
Do I want sugar in my coffee?

197
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:13,368
No, just some milk would
be good, Carol. Thanks.

198
00:13:13,688 --> 00:13:16,535
Remember all that stuff
I taught you yesterday?

199
00:13:16,785 --> 00:13:19,739
"Remember all that stuff
I taught you yesterday?"

200
00:13:20,682 --> 00:13:22,306
- Don't do that.
- "Don't do that."

201
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:26,450
- Your dad doesn't like pranks.
- "Your dad doesn't like pranks."

202
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:28,993
- Oh, damn it!
- "Oh, damn it!"

203
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,770
No! Don't say that.

204
00:13:31,537 --> 00:13:33,090
- Damn it!
- Go back to repeating.

205
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:34,874
- Damn it!
- Oh, crap!

206
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,221
"Oh, crap!"

207
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,120
I feel like my face is swelling.
Is my face swelling?

208
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,495
Phoebe, your face is fine. None of
this stuff is gonna happen to you.

209
00:13:47,715 --> 00:13:50,455
- Stop being a baby.
- Interesting you should call me that...

210
00:13:50,672 --> 00:13:53,210
...now that I may never have one.

211
00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:57,410
Okay, I got some more written, ready?

212
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,433
Yeah, okay.

213
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:04,480
"When I think of the love that these
two givers and receivers share...

214
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:09,906
...I can't help but envy the lifetime
ahead of having and loving...

215
00:14:10,086 --> 00:14:14,215
...and giving..." And then I can't
think of a good word for right here.

216
00:14:14,504 --> 00:14:17,280
- How about "receiving"?
- Yes!

217
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,849
See, Joe, not that that's not great...

218
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:27,752
...but one cool thing about having
a friend perform the ceremony...

219
00:14:28,073 --> 00:14:29,662
...is that it can be about us.

220
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:33,426
It can be more personal.
You can tell stories about us.

221
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:38,189
Like the time you
and I went to Atlantic City...

222
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:41,466
...and I made you laugh so hard
you threw up your whole steak?

223
00:14:42,095 --> 00:14:43,518
No.

224
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:46,164
Not us.

225
00:14:47,313 --> 00:14:49,010
Us.

226
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:51,938
I got you. Sorry.

227
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:54,996
So did you ever make him throw up
a whole anything?

228
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,493
Did you ever feed him a poison capsule
that made him bleed from the eyes?

229
00:15:01,822 --> 00:15:03,874
It doesn't say that.

230
00:15:04,118 --> 00:15:07,628
Suddenly somebody knows all
about the side effects.

231
00:15:08,293 --> 00:15:14,450
Joey, we want you to tell stories,
but romantic stories, nice stories.

232
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:19,800
Okay! Maybe I'll talk about London,
when you hooked up.

233
00:15:20,122 --> 00:15:22,589
Only I won't say "hooked up"...

234
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:26,097
...I'll say, "began their
beautiful journey...

235
00:15:26,315 --> 00:15:28,746
- There you go.
...by doing it."

236
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:33,757
- Joe.
- Okay, all right.

237
00:15:34,456 --> 00:15:37,718
So how did it happen?
Did your eyes meet across the room...

238
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,623
...then you're in the bathtub
and she's feeding you strawberries?

239
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:46,318
- Isn't that what happened to you?
- Yeah!

240
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:51,148
I call that "London style."

241
00:15:52,547 --> 00:15:54,136
That didn't happen with us.

242
00:15:54,462 --> 00:15:58,103
Maybe you should say it is,
because "London style" sounds nice.

243
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,305
Okay, uh...

244
00:16:01,732 --> 00:16:06,216
I was sad that night because
this guy thought I was Ross' mom.

245
00:16:07,195 --> 00:16:11,085
And Chandler was really sweet
and he consoled me and...

246
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:14,037
...we drank too much.
- Yeah, baby.

247
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:21,102
I was a gentleman and I walked her to
her hotel room and said good night.

248
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,393
- But then, later that night...
- Yeah, baby.

249
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:57,640
Cute P.J.s. Really living it up
here in London, huh?

250
00:16:59,174 --> 00:17:03,065
Well, I wasn't exactly
expecting company after...

251
00:17:03,871 --> 00:17:05,602
...9:15.

252
00:17:06,585 --> 00:17:07,759
Is Joey here?

253
00:17:08,046 --> 00:17:12,423
Last I saw he was with a bridesmaid
and a bucket of strawberries.

254
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:16,945
You're not still upset about
what that guy told you, are you?

255
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:19,346
Wouldn't you be?

256
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:23,732
It's been a really emotional time
and you've had a lot to drink...

257
00:17:24,015 --> 00:17:25,639
You have to let that go, okay?

258
00:17:25,998 --> 00:17:28,952
You were the most beautiful
woman in the room tonight.

259
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:30,969
Really?

260
00:17:31,252 --> 00:17:34,763
You kidding? You're the most
beautiful woman in most rooms...

261
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:43,878
Whoa, what's going on?

262
00:17:44,124 --> 00:17:45,096
We just made out.

263
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:47,560
- We're making out?
- Not anymore.

264
00:17:48,473 --> 00:17:52,186
- But we don't do that.
- I know, I thought it would be fun.

265
00:17:53,553 --> 00:17:54,490
How drunk are you?

266
00:17:54,771 --> 00:17:59,777
Enough to know I want to do this. Not
so much that you should feel guilty.

267
00:18:01,555 --> 00:18:02,800
That's the perfect amount.

268
00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:11,774
- You know what's weird?
- What?

269
00:18:12,097 --> 00:18:14,386
- This doesn't feel weird.
- I know.

270
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:18,906
- You're a really good kisser.
- Well, I have kissed over four women.

271
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:23,784
Want to get under the covers?
Okay.

272
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,093
Wow, you are really fast!

273
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:38,504
It bodes well for me
that speed impresses you.

274
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:42,535
- We're gonna see each other naked.
- Yep.

275
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,912
- At the same time?
- Count of three?

276
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:48,968
One, two, three.

277
00:18:53,743 --> 00:18:57,598
Well, I think it's safe to say
our friendship is effectively ruined.

278
00:18:57,848 --> 00:18:59,793
Eh, we weren't that close anyway.

279
00:19:02,754 --> 00:19:04,034
Joey, Joey, Joey...!

280
00:19:08,217 --> 00:19:09,153
Hey.

281
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:11,759
Hey, Joe.
I was just watching a movie...

282
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,155
Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.

283
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,669
No!

284
00:19:21,229 --> 00:19:23,589
It's cool, I'm still
with my bridesmaid.

285
00:19:23,873 --> 00:19:25,367
Where are the condoms?

286
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:27,451
In my bag over there.

287
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:35,976
Could you leave me one?

288
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:41,163
For just you?

289
00:19:41,755 --> 00:19:42,894
Yeah.

290
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,819
Why don't you come downstairs with me.
There's some really nice girls down there.

291
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:52,077
No, I'm fine.

292
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,757
All right. There you go, buddy.

293
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:56,256
Go nuts.

294
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,095
That's what that was?

295
00:20:01,343 --> 00:20:05,447
Because that other thing, I thought you were
onto something. But it did nothing for me.

296
00:20:05,936 --> 00:20:09,162
Can we change the topic?
Because it's really doing nothing for me.

297
00:20:10,528 --> 00:20:15,083
If I hadn't left you one, you two
might've never gotten together.

298
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:19,047
Imagine if I had sent that hooker
like I was gonna?

299
00:20:21,105 --> 00:20:23,537
It's like it was in the stars.

300
00:20:23,992 --> 00:20:25,451
Yeah, totally meant to be.

301
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:29,207
Tell him who you originally
wanted to hook up with that night.

302
00:20:30,046 --> 00:20:31,920
- What?
- What?

303
00:20:32,516 --> 00:20:33,655
What?

304
00:20:35,856 --> 00:20:38,454
Who did you originally
want to hook up with?

305
00:20:39,857 --> 00:20:42,253
Okay, fine, but please don't be upset.

306
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:46,665
I was really depressed, okay?
And really drunk.

307
00:20:47,025 --> 00:20:51,437
I wanted something stupid and
meaningless. I just wanted sex.

308
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:54,846
So, when I went to your
room that night...

309
00:20:55,062 --> 00:20:58,323
...I was actually looking for Joey.

310
00:21:05,255 --> 00:21:06,571
Yeah, baby.

311
00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:10,220
No, baby.

312
00:21:11,692 --> 00:21:12,902
Oh, my God.

313
00:21:13,223 --> 00:21:14,990
You came looking for Joey?

314
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:19,510
- Were you planning on telling me this?
- No, I didn't think it was important.

315
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:22,511
It's not important?
It's not important?

316
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:25,672
If it wasn't for a bridesmaid,
you'd be marrying him not me.

317
00:21:25,886 --> 00:21:29,185
No. The point is,
it was you that was there that night.

318
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:33,185
It is you that I'm marrying.
It is you that I fell in love with.

319
00:21:33,402 --> 00:21:39,132
And it is a love that is based
on having and giving and receiv...

320
00:21:40,395 --> 00:21:43,656
Weird. The most romantic night
of my life and I'm runner-up.

321
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:48,286
Do you know how unbelievably
glad I am that Joey wasn't there?

322
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:50,066
Hey!

323
00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:54,236
I'm a man of the cloth,
but I still have feelings.

324
00:21:56,329 --> 00:21:59,449
There's no way you're
doing this wedding now, okay?

325
00:21:59,705 --> 00:22:03,287
What? That's not fair.
It's not my fault.

326
00:22:03,636 --> 00:22:05,094
I was with my bridesmaid.

327
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,392
And who's to say
I would've said yes?

328
00:22:07,636 --> 00:22:09,748
I mean, I would've said yes.

329
00:22:11,186 --> 00:22:14,068
You are making way too
big a deal out of this.

330
00:22:14,317 --> 00:22:15,906
Everything worked out okay.

331
00:22:16,196 --> 00:22:17,512
It's just weird, okay?

332
00:22:17,831 --> 00:22:21,935
I don't want to be saying my vows with
the mental image of you and Monica.

333
00:22:22,249 --> 00:22:25,060
I need... I don't know what I need.
I need a walk.

334
00:22:25,346 --> 00:22:28,857
- Wait, Chandler, it's not a big deal.
- It is to me.

335
00:22:29,138 --> 00:22:32,400
You wanted to sleep with Batman
and settled for Robin.

336
00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:40,122
- This is crazy.
- No, Robin is so gay.

337
00:22:43,438 --> 00:22:46,534
Phoebe, what were you thinking?
How could you tell him that?

338
00:22:46,743 --> 00:22:49,281
I don't know.
I'm sorry, it just came out.

339
00:22:49,492 --> 00:22:51,674
It's a side effect.

340
00:22:54,014 --> 00:22:56,968
- So now what have we agreed?
- No more pranks.

341
00:22:57,702 --> 00:23:00,798
- What else?
- You and Daddy were not on a break.

342
00:23:01,112 --> 00:23:02,143
Very good.

343
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:08,619
Rachel, what are you doing here?

344
00:23:09,218 --> 00:23:12,029
I'm just visiting
my good friend Carol.

345
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:14,882
- Your good friend?
- Yeah.

346
00:23:15,516 --> 00:23:16,832
What's her last name?

347
00:23:19,447 --> 00:23:20,727
Carol...

348
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:23,019
...Lesbian.
- Nice.

349
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:30,264
- By the way, that line down my face...
- What line?

350
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:33,466
"What Line?"
The line that prompted a student...

351
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:37,152
...in my last class of the day to say:

352
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:39,416
"Dude, don't you ever wash your face?"

353
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,414
All right I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

354
00:23:43,627 --> 00:23:46,367
- But you were so mad already.
- Of course I was mad.

355
00:23:46,584 --> 00:23:50,225
I told you I hate this stuff. Okay?
It's not funny.

356
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:51,690
- Hey, Ross.
- Hi.

357
00:23:51,907 --> 00:23:53,437
- What's not funny?
- Practical jokes.

358
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:55,664
Well, I think they're funny.

359
00:23:56,048 --> 00:23:59,037
- You have a line down your face.
- What?

360
00:24:02,345 --> 00:24:05,928
- Okay, maybe they're not funny to you...
- Oh, my God!

361
00:24:06,173 --> 00:24:07,276
Or Carol.

362
00:24:08,677 --> 00:24:11,109
But they're funny to kids.
And who is it hurting?

363
00:24:11,496 --> 00:24:16,703
I'll tell you who it hurts. It hurts the kid
who has all his clothes stolen in gym class...

364
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:20,564
...so he has to go to the principal's office
wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt.

365
00:24:20,785 --> 00:24:22,623
That was you?

366
00:24:24,508 --> 00:24:26,619
We heard about you in junior high.

367
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:30,659
Did you really just shake your fist in
the air and shout, "I will be revenged!"

368
00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:35,952
I will be!

369
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:41,101
I don't want you teaching my son
that stuff anymore.

370
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,357
- Okay?
- Fine. Fine.

371
00:24:43,643 --> 00:24:47,285
Once I taught him that stuff,
he called me "fun Aunt Rachel."

372
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:49,625
And I loved being fun Aunt Rachel.

373
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,975
But I'll go back to being boring
and uncomfortable Aunt Rachel.

374
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,393
No, it's not what I want.

375
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,188
I'm glad you guys were bonding but...

376
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:05,515
Look, he doesn't have any siblings.

377
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:08,058
Somebody has to teach him this stuff.

378
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,057
I haven't taught him anything
a normal 6-year-old doesn't know.

379
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:14,325
- Crap!
- I gotta go.

380
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,214
- Hey.
- Hey.

381
00:25:25,498 --> 00:25:31,441
You want this scone? It came for me
but it would rather sleep with you.

382
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:33,186
Nothing even happened.

383
00:25:35,413 --> 00:25:39,340
- Look, I know you want to do the wedding...
- No. If you don't want me to do it...

384
00:25:39,588 --> 00:25:44,036
...I accept that. I don't care about that.
I just don't want you to be upset.

385
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:46,014
How can I not be upset?

386
00:25:46,373 --> 00:25:49,327
I finally fall in love
with this fantastic woman...

387
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:51,754
...and it turns out
she wanted you first.

388
00:25:52,078 --> 00:25:54,996
Yeah, for like a half an hour
one night.

389
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:59,166
Chandler, she wants you
for the rest of her life.

390
00:25:59,455 --> 00:26:01,436
You're so lucky.

391
00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:04,705
Look what I missed out on
by not being there.

392
00:26:04,986 --> 00:26:06,089
Although, you know what?

393
00:26:06,308 --> 00:26:09,499
It could never have worked out
like you guys did.

394
00:26:09,718 --> 00:26:12,351
Because you guys are perfect
for each other.

395
00:26:13,893 --> 00:26:18,127
We look at you and we
see you together, and it just...

396
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:22,101
...it fits, you know?

397
00:26:22,695 --> 00:26:25,994
And you just know
it's gonna last forever.

398
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,866
That's what you should say.

399
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:33,403
What?

400
00:26:36,124 --> 00:26:39,386
When you're marrying us,
that's what you should say.

401
00:26:40,543 --> 00:26:42,346
Really? I could do it?

402
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:44,851
I'd love you to do it.

403
00:26:45,762 --> 00:26:47,150
Hey.

404
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:54,284
But those are the words.
Those exact words.

405
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:57,761
Well, I don't remember exactly but...

406
00:26:58,913 --> 00:27:03,990
...it's pretty much about having
and giving and sharing and receiving.

407
00:27:07,577 --> 00:27:09,521
I'm sorry to do this to you again...

408
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:12,306
...but could you look after Ben
for a little bit?

409
00:27:12,517 --> 00:27:14,177
I've got this meeting at school.

410
00:27:14,395 --> 00:27:17,729
And he asked for his "fun" Aunt Rachel.

411
00:27:18,744 --> 00:27:22,113
Well, of course I will watch him.
We have fun, don't we, Ben?

412
00:27:23,616 --> 00:27:26,249
- Okay, see you later, pal.
- Okay.

413
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:34,852
- Wait a minute. Ben, I can't do it.
- What?

414
00:27:35,061 --> 00:27:37,387
Can't let him go out that way.
He's got a meeting.

415
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:40,687
- You got something here on your back.
- What?

416
00:27:41,707 --> 00:27:43,510
That's great. That is great.

417
00:27:43,724 --> 00:27:46,120
What did we just finish
talking about, Ben?

418
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:50,047
"What did we just finish
talking about, Ben?"

419
00:27:50,265 --> 00:27:54,916
All right, that's it. Come here.
You are in big trouble young man!

420
00:27:55,137 --> 00:27:58,019
Ben, come here! I am not kidding!

421
00:27:58,233 --> 00:28:00,379
You gotta stop doing...

422
00:28:00,634 --> 00:28:02,401
My God!

423
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,889
- So you guys doing okay?
- Yeah.

424
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:29,954
We talked and Monica made me
see that I overreacted a little bit.

425
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:34,129
- Some things are more important.
- Yeah, baby.

426
00:28:36,991 --> 00:28:40,704
I'm really glad you guys are okay,
but I just keep thinking...

427
00:28:41,026 --> 00:28:44,146
...what would've happened
if you two had hooked up.

428
00:28:47,254 --> 00:28:48,986
Honey, dinner's ready!

429
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,550
What's my little chef
got for me tonight?

430
00:28:57,831 --> 00:28:59,669
Your favorite.

431
00:29:00,336 --> 00:29:01,925
Fried stuff with cheese.

432
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,240
And lots of it!

433
00:29:06,842 --> 00:29:08,158
Thanks, sweetheart.

434
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:10,075
Give me a little sugar...

435
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:16,298
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

436
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,463
How you doing?

437
00:29:27,578 --> 00:29:29,238
Here you go.

438
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,333
Oh, my God.

439
00:29:31,545 --> 00:29:33,241
This is a six-hour pill.

440
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:36,447
That's it! I'm out of the woods.

441
00:29:37,006 --> 00:29:38,465
What a relief.

442
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:40,373
Good for you.

443
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,951
It's like a huge
weight has been lifted.

444
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:45,905
Because, look,
no hair loss, no rash, no hives.

445
00:29:46,122 --> 00:29:48,375
I'm just so happy!

446
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:53,420
Because, no shortness of breath,
no temporary euphoria...
