1
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:11,343
The caterer sent me this list of 12
appetizers. I have to narrow it to six.

2
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,679
Food? Oh, give me.

3
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:19,184
So did Monica tell you we're trying to get
The Swing Kings to play the wedding?

4
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,020
Since when are you into swing music?

5
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:24,857
Since forever. I used to go all over town
listening to bands.

6
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:28,402
- Chandler.
- Gap commercial.

7
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:33,866
- So did you book them? Did you call?
- I will.

8
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:38,370
- You want me to call?
- No. I'll do it. You stick to your job.

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,540
- What is your job?
- Staying out of the way.

10
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:46,587
This is impossible.
Why don't you just pick all 15?

11
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:50,424
- There were only 12.
- Oh, yeah, I added three.

12
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,260
What are "peanut-butter fingers"?

13
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,646
Well, hello.

14
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,648
She's cute.

15
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,025
Should we go try to talk to her?

16
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:55,447
Sure. The great thing about being engaged,
I'm not nervous to talk to pretty girls anymore.

17
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,574
Could you guys help me?

18
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,913
Yeah, let me get that for you.

19
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,959
- It's really heavy.
- I got it.

20
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,627
Oh!

21
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:14,800
So hi, I'm Ross,
and this is my friend, Chandler.

22
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,762
I'm Kristen.

23
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,390
Kristen. Hi. Are you new to the area?

24
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,643
Because if you are,
I'd love to show you around sometime.

25
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:28,355
- I actually just moved from four blocks over.
- Oh.

26
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,108
But this block is like a whole other world.

27
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:35,320
Actually, it does have
a very interesting history.

28
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:40,993
This street is the first street in the city
to have an underground sewer system.

29
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,329
Before that, sewage and waste...

30
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,791
...would just flow
right down the street. Yeah.

31
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,669
Sometimes ankle-deep.

32
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,380
Smooth.

33
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,717
Excuse me?

34
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:05,017
You're gonna be starving after moving.
What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?

35
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,977
- I'd like that.
- Yeah? Great.

36
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,437
Let me take this up.

37
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,940
- After you.
- Oh, no. After you.

38
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,485
Oh, my God!

39
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,747
Am I crazy, or does this totally go?

40
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,419
Oh, my God! You look so beautiful!

41
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,923
Thank you, Rachel.
But look at Monica!

42
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,093
This is it. Yeah, this is the one.

43
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,596
I can't believe I found it.

44
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:47,476
Wow, you look so beautiful.
If I knew you, I'd cry.

45
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:51,146
I'm Monica Geller. Ball like a baby.

46
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,731
I'm Megan Bailey.

47
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,610
- Have you found your dress yet?
- No. These dresses are all so amazing...

48
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:00,447
...but I couldn't afford one.
- No, I can't afford this either.

49
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:05,535
I'm here to figure out the one I want,
then I'll get it at Kleinman's, this discount place.

50
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,955
Day after tomorrow,
they're having a huge sale.

51
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:11,500
- Thanks for the tip.
- When are you getting married?

52
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:16,797
- I'm not. I just like to try these on.
- I do the same thing.

53
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,510
I'm just kidding.
I'm getting married July 25th.

54
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,554
I'm just kidding too. Ha, ha.

55
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,432
I'm getting married in December.

56
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,895
- When are you getting married?
- May 15th.

57
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,731
Ooh. It's close.
So who's your photographer?

58
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,733
- Jeffrey.
- We met with him.

59
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:42,030
- Did he show you nude wedding photos?
- Best Man? Wow!

60
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,325
I know. I almost called off
my wedding. Heh, heh, heh.

61
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:49,204
- Oh, who's your band?
- My fiancé wants The Swing Kings.

62
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:53,542
You're lucky. My fiancé wants
the heavy metal band, Carcass.

63
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:58,672
Is that spelled with a "C" or a "K"?
Oh, my God, it doesn't matter, they're both great!

64
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,509
Oh, you know what? Don't buy that here.

65
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:06,346
Now that you know what you want,
go to Kleinman's. Get it half off.

66
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,724
This place is so over-priced.

67
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,851
I own this store.

68
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,023
So does this come
in another color, or...

69
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,827
Hi. You moving in or moving out?

70
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,038
- Moving in.
- Can I give you a hand?

71
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:36,126
Okay, but be careful. The guy who was helping
before had to leave because he hurt his back.

72
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,712
- Boyfriend?
- No.

73
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,630
I'm Joey.

74
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,341
Kristen.

75
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,427
Wow. What a beautiful name.

76
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,347
What is it again?

77
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,767
- Kristen.
- Ah, that's it. Okay.

78
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,228
- You live around here?
- Yeah. Yeah, right down there.

79
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,314
Let me give you a tip.

80
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:02,319
Don't take a nap on this stoop.
You could wake up without shoes.

81
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,821
- I'll remember that.
- Okay.

82
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:09,701
Listen, would you like
to have dinner with me tonight?

83
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,080
I have plans tonight.
How about tomorrow?

84
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,874
Sounds great.
Well, where does this go?

85
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,710
You look strong. I'll take that,
you grab one of the boxes.

86
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,921
Okay. Yeah.

87
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,968
Yeah, I'll get this one.

88
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,765
What's taking so long?

89
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,019
WOMAN 2
Come on.

90
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,814
So this is Brooklyn?

91
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:43,110
All right, listen up. There's usually only
one dress in each size.

92
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,780
So when they open those doors,
fan out.

93
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:51,910
This is what you're looking for.
Memorize it.

94
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:57,249
When you locate the dress
blow on these, all right?

95
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,503
Three sharp blasts.
When you hear it, come running.

96
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,588
Okay, got it.

97
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,881
Here he comes!

98
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:08,301
- Oh, they're pushing!
- Don't be a baby!

99
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,012
- Out of the way!
- Let's go!

100
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,349
Hey, Rachel! Come on!

101
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:27,195
No. No, not it. Not it. Not it. Ugh.

102
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,992
Don't crowd me.

103
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,539
This is it! This is the dress!
Oh, my God. It's perfect.

104
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,916
I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!

105
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,879
- Megan!
- Monica!

106
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,755
- You came!
- Yeah!

107
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,717
- This is my dress!
- No!

108
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,888
- Yes, it is. You saw me wearing it.
- And now you'll see me buying it.

109
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,307
You freak!

110
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,310
You wouldn't even know
about this place without me.

111
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:03,648
- Look, you don't want to fight me.
- Maybe I do. I'm pretty feisty!

112
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,776
- I'm coming! I'm coming!
- Hey!

113
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,113
Okay! Hey.

114
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,991
Oh, what do I do?!

115
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,502
What are you doing?
Did you find the dress?

116
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,170
Did you find the dress?

117
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,173
No. You gotta get me out of here.
These shoppers are crazy.

118
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,467
- We've gotta get Monica.
- You gotta hold my hand!

119
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,801
Oh, my God.

120
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,931
Excuse me! Excuse me!

121
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,185
Go! Go! Go!

122
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,145
- Hey.
- Go!

123
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,241
So, Ross,
how was your date the other night?

124
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:59,496
Did you tell her about the magical
ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?

125
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:05,877
Laugh all you want, but she left me a message
saying she'd like to go out again.

126
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,422
- Oh.
- In fact, I'll go call her right now.

127
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,717
And I'll make sure and tell her my
friend Chandler says...

128
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,557
- Hey, Chandler.
- Hey.

129
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:22,769
Sorry I didn't stop by last night,
but I had a date.

130
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:27,232
Joe, when it's 1:00 in the morning and you
don't come by? That's okay.

131
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:32,320
Check it out. It was with this really hot girl
who just moved in right across the street.

132
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,323
- Really? Right across the street?
- Yeah.

133
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,867
- When did you meet her?
- Two days ago.

134
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,662
Excellent!

135
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,249
- You know, Ross met somebody too.
- Oh, yeah?

136
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,792
- Hey.
- How'd it go?

137
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,169
Great. We're going out again Saturday.

138
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:53,174
But I found out she's
also seeing some other guy.

139
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,928
Really?

140
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:02,309
Joe, what would you do
if you were in Ross' situation?

141
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:06,813
Well, I sort of am. I'm dating this girl
who's also seeing another guy.

142
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,190
But I'm not too worried about it.

143
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,654
You shouldn't be. Believe me, I wouldn't want
to be the guy who's up against you.

144
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,159
I mean, that doofus is going to lose.

145
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,080
So this is nice.

146
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,794
I wish I didn't have to go.
Believe me.

147
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,212
But I have to.

148
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,382
By the way, what's the name
of the girl you're dating?

149
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,177
- Kristen Leigh.
- Bye.

150
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,605
Well, obviously, only one of us
can keep dating her.

151
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,484
Obviously. So how do we decide?

152
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:56,196
Well now,
let's look at this objectively.

153
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,740
I think I should date her.

154
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,035
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

155
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,747
Or I'm the one who dates her.

156
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:10,585
That's interesting.
But check this out. I date her.

157
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,505
Yeah, I like that. But just to go
in another direction...

158
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,132
Okay. This can go on for a while.

159
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,427
- We should order some food then.
- No, Joey.

160
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:24,557
Look, why don't we
just let her decide, okay?

161
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,602
We'll each go out with her
one more time.

162
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,438
And we'll see who she likes best.

163
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,817
That sounds fair.

164
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,862
Maybe I'll take her
to that new French restaurant down the street.

165
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,533
Wait a second.
We have to set a spending limit on the date.

166
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,577
I don't have the money to take her
to a fancy place like that.

167
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:48,665
Well, sorry.
That's what I do on dates.

168
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:53,461
All right. Well, I guess I'll just have to do
what I do on dates.

169
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:02,595
- So let's decide on a spending limit.
- Yeah.

170
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,472
Uh...

171
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,060
And a slice...

172
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,439
Six dollars?

173
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:17,193
- I was thinking more like a hundred.
- Okay.

174
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,196
Can I borrow 94 dollars?

175
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,162
Uh.

176
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:30,540
I know. Can you hand me a tissue?

177
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,759
You're out of Diet Coke.

178
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,388
Hello?

179
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,559
What? You what?

180
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,603
You listen here, missy!

181
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:54,981
What?

182
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,651
That was Megan. She booked The Swing Kings
on the day of our wedding...

183
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,404
...and said she'd only
give them back for the dress!

184
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,117
Does that mean Carcass is available?

185
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,248
What am I gonna do? That's the dress!
That is "the" dress!

186
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,294
Chandler wants the band.
What do I do?

187
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,172
- Figure out a way to talk him out of it.
- How?

188
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,759
You're out of toilet paper!

189
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,101
- Hey.
- What's up?

190
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,230
I wanted to wish you good luck
on your date.

191
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,690
- Thanks.
- What time are you meeting?

192
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:41,069
We have 8:00 reservations
at Grand Merci Bistro.

193
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,614
That's in 20 minutes.
You'd better get dressed.

194
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,619
- I am dressed.
- Oh, well, good.

195
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,871
For me.

196
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,793
What's this?
Did you give yourself a facial?

197
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,587
I have an oily T-zone.

198
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,715
Okay, dude.

199
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:08,596
- Hey, you sent Kristen flowers?
- That's right.

200
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:13,643
You spent 100 dollars.
That's the limit. You're screwed!

201
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:19,482
Actually, I sent the flowers before
the actual date, so technically...

202
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:24,028
...technically, I didn't break any rules.
Thanks for stopping by though.

203
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,657
That's how it's gonna be?
I can break the rules too.

204
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,410
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

205
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,663
- I'm not surprised.
- You won't get away with this.

206
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,540
- You don't have much choice.
- We'll see!

207
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,041
- Bye-bye.
- Yeah, bye-bye.

208
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,963
Hey! So just a light layer?

209
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,841
Yeah, just here and there.

210
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:55,059
Joey got meat sauce
on the banister again.

211
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,271
Swing music is so out.

212
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,941
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room
for that to work.

213
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,320
What are you guys talking about?

214
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,031
We're talking about The Swing Kings...

215
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,992
...and whether they're
the right way to go.

216
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,870
I went to a wedding
where they had swing music...

217
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,497
...and two months later
the couple divorced.

218
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,169
I'm not saying
there's any connection here...

219
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,756
...but they did tell me
that's why they got divorced.

220
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,134
But I love swing music!

221
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,011
But The Swing Kings?

222
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:35,642
They suck so much that people actually die
at their concerts. They just stop living.

223
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,729
When Monica and I went to see them,
we had fun.

224
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,689
And there's another reason.

225
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:46,194
- Well, what is the other reason?
- I don't want to say.

226
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,989
Well, you have to,
because maybe it's stupid.

227
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,870
It's just while Monica and I
were dancing to them...

228
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,290
...it was the first time
I knew that...

229
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:04,337
...you were the woman that I wanted
to dance all my dances with.

230
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,092
Oh, crap.

231
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,770
- Our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
- Oh, great.

232
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,232
- Is your back feeling better?
- Yeah, it's fine.

233
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,235
I guess, ahem, the more muscles you have...

234
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,905
...the more they can
spasm out of control.

235
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,784
- Kristen?
- Joey!

236
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,536
- Hi.
- Hi.

237
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:41,082
- What are you doing here?
- I like this place.

238
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:46,045
And technically, technically,
I'm not breaking any rules, so...

239
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:50,508
Well, Ross, this is Joey.
Joey, Ross.

240
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,386
- Hi.
- Hi. It's nice to meet you.

241
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,848
I used to have a friend named Joey.

242
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,393
I don't anymore.

243
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,814
Our table will be ready
in a couple minutes.

244
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,152
Sure! I would love
to wait with you guys! Thanks!

245
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,908
So Joey, you look familiar.

246
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,870
Are you on TV or something?

247
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,289
Joey doesn't like to talk about it...

248
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,959
...but he's one of the stars
of Days of Our Lives.

249
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:30,006
That's right. That's right.
Don't you play a woman?

250
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:36,054
A woman in a man's body.

251
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,389
Much better.

252
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,602
So, Ross, it's funny, because you
look familiar to me too.

253
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,354
Have you ever been married?

254
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,149
Yes, I have.

255
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,651
In fact, just the other day...

256
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:55,031
...Kris and I talked about how
I've been married and have a son.

257
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:59,327
- Yeah, little Eric.
- That's right. Wait. No, Ben.

258
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:05,166
So you've just been married
the one time then?

259
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:11,297
- Well, um...
- You've been married twice?

260
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:15,259
Yes. And...

261
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,179
...another time after that.

262
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,226
Boy, I'm getting hungry.

263
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,562
Ahem. Hey, Joey, have you ever been
so hungry on a date...

264
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:31,234
...that when the girl goes to the
bathroom, you eat some of her food?

265
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,948
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.

266
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:43,913
So, Ross, now why did
that first marriage break up? Hm?

267
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:49,210
Was it because the woman was straight
or because she was a lesbian?

268
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,923
- Do you two know each other?
- No.

269
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,968
But he seems like
a guy who'd marry a woman...

270
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:01,722
...on the verge of being a lesbian
and then push her over the edge.

271
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:09,272
Wait a minute!
Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?

272
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:15,653
Have you ever slept
in the same bed with a monkey?

273
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,781
Hey, you leave Marcel out of this!

274
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,868
Fine! You ever gotten stuck
in a pair of your own leather pants?

275
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:27,456
Hey, hey! Have you ever locked yourself
in a TV cabinet, VD-boy?

276
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,917
Monkey-lover!

277
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,136
Where do you think we lost her?

278
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,139
Probably around "gonorrhea."

279
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,108
- Hi, honey, I'm home!
- Don't come in here!

280
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,196
Why, do you have another
boyfriend in there?

281
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,407
No. We only mess around at his place.

282
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:07,246
It's funny, I started it, but now it's scaring me,
so could you come out here, please?

283
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,207
No. I'm wearing a wedding dress.

284
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,125
You got a wedding dress? That's great.

285
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,962
- Yeah, but I'm not keeping it.
- Then why can't I see it?

286
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,048
Oh. I guess you can.

287
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,426
But I have to return it,
so you can't like it.

288
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,846
Okay, I promise. I'll hate it.

289
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,897
Wow. You look hideous.

290
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,483
Really?

291
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:40,613
Yeah. That's like the most
ugliest dress I've ever seen.

292
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,865
Why do you have to return it?

293
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,035
Because it doesn't really fit.

294
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,329
Oh, by the way, I booked The Swing Kings.

295
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,457
Oh, that's great. Great. Thanks.

296
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,377
But that dress, I mean, it's like, ugh, terrible.

297
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:58,130
- It makes me want to rip it right off you.
- Okay.

298
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,049
But you can't rip it.

299
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,093
- Well, maybe a little.
- Okay.

300
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:14,855
Hey, guys, you want to look
at the song list for the wedding?

301
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,482
Guys?

302
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,859
I thought you'd be gone all day.

303
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,779
All right, what's going on?

304
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:34,083
I'm sorry. I should probably
leave you girls alone.

305
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,963
Laugh all you want, but in 10 minutes
we'll have younger-looking skin.

306
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,840
- Yeah.
- Right there.

307
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,844
You know, she could use a little...

308
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,931
- Oh, nice shot! Yeah!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
