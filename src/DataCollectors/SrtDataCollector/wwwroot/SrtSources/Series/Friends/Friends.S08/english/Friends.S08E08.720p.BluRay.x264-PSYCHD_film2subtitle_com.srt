00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:09,258
Hey, Pheebs, I'm having dinner with my dad
tomorrow. Wanna come?

2
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:11,468
Sure, yeah, he's kind of sexy.

3
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:14,555
Oh, no, I'll be there too.

4
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:19,977
Okay, so we'll just come up with a signal.
If it's going well, you can take off.

5
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,438
No, Phoebe,
I just need you there for support.

6
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:25,816
- I haven't told him I'm pregnant yet.
- Oh. Why not?

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,194
Because I know he's gonna flip out
and I hate it when he gets angry.

8
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:32,156
Oh, Rachel.
This is all so "Papa Don't Preach."

9
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,868
No, Pheeb, wait, he's a scary guy.
I mean, one time he caught me smoking.

10
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:39,705
He said if he ever saw me doing that again,
he would make me eat the entire pack.

11
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,416
- Wow. Well, I will be there.
- Okay.

12

Gosh, I'm not gonna let that man
make you eat your baby.

13
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,800
Oh. Hey, who is that guy?
I think I know him.

14
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:53,886
- No, you don't.
- No, you don't.

15
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:58,015
Oh, my God. Monica, he's the stripper
from your bachelorette party.

16
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,687
Her what?

17
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,107
Your secret bachelorette party.

18
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:12,362
- You had a bachelorette party?
- She untied his G-string with her teeth.

Somebody stop me.

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,912
I thought we weren't gonna have bachelor,
bachelorette parties.

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,206
You know, we agreed
that it's a silly tradition.

22
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,041
It's a grand tradition.

23
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,921
I'm sorry. They surprised me.
There was nothing I could do.

24
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,091
Well, you could have untied it
with your hands.

25
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,884
This is so unfair.

26
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,929
The one thing I wanted to do
was throw my best friend a bachelor party...

27
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,140
...but, oh, I wasn't allowed to.
All we got was a stupid steak dinner.

28
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,934
You went home with the waitress.

29

Ha. Yeah, that was a good night.

30

I can't believe you didn't tell me.

31

You know that the two pillars of marriage
are openness and honesty.

32
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:57,407
Ugh. I knew giving you that book was
gonna come back and bite me in the ass.

33
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,703
How about I order everyone
the Moroccan chicken?

34
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,371
Oh, I don't eat meat.

35
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,165
It's chicken.

36
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:51,420
- Yeah, I don't eat that either.
- I'll never understand you lesbians.

37
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:57,759
- So, baby, tell me, what is new with you?
- Well, actually, um...

38
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,679
- Ahem. Your '74 Lafite, sir.
- Seventy-four?

39
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,309
I ordered the '75. That's a magnificent wine.
The '74 is sewage.

40
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,102
Why would you bring me sewage?

41
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,816
Is that a hard question? Are you an idiot?
Is that why you're a waiter?

42
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,652
This is why I told the manager
I wouldn't wait on you tonight.

43
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,822
Oh, come on.
Don't be such a baby.

44
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:25,204
In case you didn't notice,
that is a scary man.

45
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:29,041
He's right, though.
The '74 is absolute piss.

46
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:34,421
This was such a huge mistake.
I can't tell him, Phoebe. I can't.

47
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,757
- Rachel...
- No, it's okay. This is what's gonna happen.

48
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:41,345
I'm gonna wait a couple of years
and then the baby will tell him.

49
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:47,017
- Why? So he can get mad at the baby?
- Hey, that is the baby's problem.

50
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,857
- Oh. Everything okay with the waiter?
- I have no idea. I went to the bathroom.

51
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,240
So, sweetie, you were starting to tell me
what is, uh...? What is new with you?

I got TiVo.

55
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,917
- What's TiVo?
- It's slang for "pregnant."

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,841

Well, uh, yes and no.

Please don't tell me it's her.

Oh, thanks. Although it seemed like
you were falling asleep there a little.
