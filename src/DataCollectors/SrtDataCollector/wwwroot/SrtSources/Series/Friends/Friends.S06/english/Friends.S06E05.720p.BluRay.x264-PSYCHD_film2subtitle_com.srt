1
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:07,464
Oh, I cannot believe that you didn't tell me
we are still married.

2
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:09,383
Look, I was going to tell you.

3
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:12,177
When? After the birth
of our first secret child?

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,682
Ross didn't get the annulment.
We are still married.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,892
- You're kidding?
- Oh, my God.

6
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,770
Ross.

7
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,939
Okay, maybe it wasn't
my best decision...

8
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,233
...but I couldn't face
another failed marriage.

9
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:27,860
Let me just jump in and ask.

10
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,071
At what point did you think
this was a successful marriage?

11
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:37,369
Rach, come on. If you think about it,
it's actually kind of funny.

12
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,874
Okay, maybe it's best
not to think about it.

13
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:47,129
Oh, this is inexcusable.
I'm shocked to my very core.

14
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,050
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.

15
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,889
Another lie. You have a sickness.

16
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,809
Ross, just for my own peace of mind...

17
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,437
...you're not married
to any more of us, are you?

18
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,019
Oh, hey, someone left their keys.

19
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,606
Ooh, to a Porsche.

20
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,609
- Hey, Gunther, are these yours?
- Yeah. That's what I drive.

21
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:55,614
I make 4 bucks an hour.
I saved up for 350 years.

22
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,409
Uh-uh.

23
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,497
Hey, did anybody lose their keys?

24
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,499
Why don't you put them
in the lost and found?

25
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,501
There's a lost and found?

26
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,254
My shoe!

27
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,423
You left a shoe here?

28
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,425
Well, I didn't realize till I got home.

29
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,595
I wasn't gonna walk all the way
back down here with one shoe.

30
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,891
I'm gonna go find that guy's car
and leave a note on the windshield.

31
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,728
Oh, good. When he comes back for
his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.

32
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,355
Great. Thanks.

33
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,734
Oh, good, good. You guys are here.
Listen.

34
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,486
How would you like
to spend tomorrow...

35
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,239
...taking care of three
incredibly cute little puppies?

36
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,783
Oh, my God. What a fun day.
That sounds great.

37
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,618
Yeah, all right.

38
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,204
Okay, well, I'll bring them by
tomorrow morning.

39
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:47,708
Okay, and by the way,
they're not actually puppies.

40
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,419
They're Frank and Alice's triplets.
Okay, see you.

41
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:52,921
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

42
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,175
Please, please, please?
Frank and Alice...

43
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,928
...asked me to babysit the triplets.
I'm nervous. I've never done that by myself.

44
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,847
Don't worry about it, Phoebe. We'll do it.

45
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,851
Yeah, I'm gonna pass, because I was
kind of iffy when it was puppies.

46
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,814
Come on, Chandler. Come on,
it'll give us great practice for when...

47
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,358
...people with babies come to visit.

48
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,114
Nice car.

49
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,491
Yeah, it's, uh... It's not mine.

50
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,663
- I love your car.
- Yeah. It's mine.

51
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,585
- I bet it's fast.
- Me too. Yeah.

52
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,003
And comfortable.

53
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,964
- Do you, uh, like leather seats?
- Yeah.

54
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,760
It's got them.

55
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,601
So I still have boxes here.

56
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,479
I still have boxes at Ross'.

57
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,648
And I have nowhere to live.

58
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,525
Wow, I could so easily
freak out right now.

59
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,444
What about me?

60
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:01,114
I just found out Denise is leaving town
for a while. I don't have a roommate.

61
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:08,080
Well, maybe I could be your roommate,
Pheebs.

62
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,541
Maybe you could be my roommate.

63
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,753
- Well, there's an idea.
- Yeah.

64
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,213
- That would be great.
- Oh.

65
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:20,050
- Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
- Um, she said she'd be back December 26th.

66
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,219
Oh! December 26th.

67
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,012
Heh, maybe she's Santa Claus.

68
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:35,107
Oh, look who it is.
My husband, the apple of my eye.

69
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,860
Okay, I got us a court date
for tomorrow at 2...

70
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,405
...and I picked up all the forms.

71
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,948
I'll take care of everything.

72
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,450
Sure, if you say you're gonna
take care of everything...

73
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,869
...I have no reason to doubt you.

74
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,955
Give me those forms.

75
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,792
All right, now, I'm gonna do this my way,
and I don't wanna hear a peep out of you.

76
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,712
- Okay, Rach, but...
- Ah, you're peeping.

77
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,718
Ross, you know what? I just got...

78
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,554
- Why? Why did you do this?
- Look, I told you...

79
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,265
I don't wanna hear
"three failed marriages."

80
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,268
Look, if you'd had two failed marriages,
you'd understand.

81
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,645
Well, you know what?
Thanks to you, I'm halfway there.

82
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,149
Oh.

83
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,570
Oh, I am so mad, Ross. I don't think
I've ever been this angry.

84
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,240
What about the time I said
we were on a break?

85
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,450
Oh.

86
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,374
Pheebs, how's it going?

87
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,627
I'm doing okay. Do you think they're
having fun? Am I talking too fast?

88
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,171
No. You sound like me.

89
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,633
It's going great. Look at Chandler
with Little Baby Girl Chandler.

90
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:48,930
Little Baby Girl Chandler. Where have
I heard that before? Oh, right, Coach Rubin.

91
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,687
You know what, Pheebs?

92
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,399
When you're done over there,
we've got a kind of situation over here too.

93
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,195
Uh-uh. No. We are all responsible
for our own babies.

94
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,823
See, that's where I think you're wrong.
We've been playing them man-to-man.

95
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,534
We should really be playing
a zone defense.

96
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,161
What do you mean?

97
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,996
I just think things will go smoother...

98
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:17,042
...if we each have our own zone, you know?
Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping.

99
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,669
And, Mon, you can be in charge
of diapering.

100
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:24,049
And I can be in charge of looking at how
cute they are when they put their hands...

101
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,595
That sounds really great,
but you should be in charge of wiping.

102
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,681
Okay, I'm a rookie.
I should not be in the end zone.

103
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,652
Wow, this is so great.

104
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,696
This is exactly how we set the plates
at the restaurant.

105
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,783
Yeah? Well, this is not what I ordered.

106
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,747
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

107
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,374
Hey, babies.

108
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,543
I'm having the best morning.

109
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,462
That, uh, Porsche I've got the keys to?
Still there.

110
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,049
Shocking, since you still have the keys.

111
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,470
You should see the treatment I get
when I'm with that car.

112
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:14,141
People are friendly. They wanna talk.
And not just about the car.

113
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,351
One guy advised me
on my equity investments.

114
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,686
What equity investments?

115
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,897
The ones that got me the Porsche.
Will you keep up?

116
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,779
I figured, if people keep seeing me
just standing there...

117
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,781
...they're gonna start to think
I don't own it.

118
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,201
So I figure I'll wash it, right?
Monica, you got a bucket and some soap?

119
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:36,121
Oh, yeah. I got soap
and sponges and rags...

120
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,709
...and carnauba wax
and polishing compound.

121
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,794
You don't even have a car.

122
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,506
I know. But one time there was this
dirty car parked in front of the building...

123
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,133
...so I washed it.

124
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,553
- And?
- And six others.

125
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,054
There you are.

126
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:00,103
- Yeah, she tops out at 130.
- Wow.

127
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,440
And that's just in the city.
I get her up to 160 upstate.

128
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,026
Really? You got a place upstate?

129
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,861
Sure.

130
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,407
- Well, I'll see you later.
- Okay. Take it easy.

131
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,828
Hey. That's my car.

132
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,289
Really? Oh, uh...

133
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,041
Just give me five more minutes.

134
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,169
What are you doing?

135
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,422
Well, I found the keys,
and now I'm just polishing her up.

136
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,134
- But it's my car.
- Yeah, but it's my wax.

137
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,430
Listen, I don't come to the city much.

138
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,226
And I don't know if you're crazy
or if this is some kind of street theater...

139
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,853
...but could I have my keys?

140
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,190
Sure. Yeah. I'll save your parking spot.

141
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,192
I'm not coming back.

142
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,194
- Why not?
- I live upstate.

143
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,321
Yeah, so did I.

144
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,951
I don't know why I was so nervous
about this...

145
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:59,287
...and I don't know why Frank and Alice
are always complaining. This is easy.

146
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,082
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime,
that's the same.

147
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,836
Check it out. Check it out.
When the babies wake up...

148
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,838
...they can meet Krog.

149
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,635
What are you doing?
That thing could put someone's eye out.

150
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,347
He can do more than that.
He can destroy the universe.

151
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,809
No, Chandler, they could swallow
one of those little parts.

152
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,813
And also, look at his smooth area.
That's just gonna mess them up.

153
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,525
They're not gonna swallow anything.
You're too overprotective.

154
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,320
When I was a kid, my mom used to
just throw me into a pile of broken glass.

155
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,491
- What?
- Glass, sand, whatever.

156
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,204
Oh, look at little Leslie
stretching in her sleep.

157
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,664
Oh, it's so cute.

158
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,959
I wonder what age it is when you stop
putting both legs behind your head.

159
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,210
Oh, I can still do that.

160
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,298
How are you still single?

161
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:56,177
All right, ahem. I thought about it,
and maybe you're right.

162
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,887
Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.

163
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:02,017
- Good. What made you change your mind?
- I swallowed his sonic blaster gun.

164
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,603
How did that happen?

165
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,731
Well, I was trying to prove
that I was right, you know?

166
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,941
And it turns out I was wrong...

167
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,360
...and now it's lodged in my throat.

168
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,743
Damn it, this whole time we were
concentrating on the babies...

169
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,454
...and no one was watching Chandler.

170
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,043
Okay, you two are asking the court
for an annulment?

171
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,338
Yes, Your Honor.
And here are our forms, all filled out.

172
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,506
So based on your petition...

173
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,593
...you are seeking an annulment
on the grounds...

174
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,262
...that "Mr. Geller is mentally unstable."

175
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,602
Fine. I'm mentally unstable.

176
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,439
And based on the fact that "Mr. Geller
is an intravenous drug user."

177
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,943
- What?
- Uh, yes. Heroin and crack.

178
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,406
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug.

179
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,075
Well, you would know.

180
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,663
Now, it also says here that you:

181
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,624
"Lied about your sexual preference
before marriage."

182
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,419
- Oh, come on.
- Ross, please. I found the magazines.

183
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,966
And, finally, that you were
"unable to consummate the marriage."

184
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:20,845
Well, that makes sense since
you're gay and addicted to heroin.

185
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,933
Okay, you know, I'm sorry,
this is insane.

186
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:29,396
I'm not addicted to heroin,
I'm not gay, and there is no problem...

187
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,314
...with my ability
to consummate anything.

188
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:35,151
Look, I'll consummate this marriage
right here, right now.

189
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,780
That won't be necessary.

190
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:42,826
And when we were dating,
we consummated like bunnies.

191
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:47,747
Now, if you two were involved in a serious
relationship, that really creates a problem.

192
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:51,292
Your Honor, rest assured,
that relationship ended two years ago.

193
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,587
And can you please strike "consummated
like bunnies" from the record.

194
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,800
Is there anything in this record
that is actually true?

195
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,262
Uh, well, yes. We got married in Vegas.

196
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,306
And, uh, the names, I think.

197
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,350
Well, based on what I've heard...

198
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,894
...you two certainly don't qualify
for an annulment.

199
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,523
If you don't wanna be together,
you'll have to file for divorce.

200
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:18,111
That's great. You happy now? Look what
you did with your funny, funny form.

201
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:22,657
What? Me? What about you and your
"consummated like bunnies" nonsense?

202
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,827
And what...?
What are you typing that for?

203
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,329
She already said
we don't get the annulment.

204
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,540
Don't type that. What...?

205
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,251
Stop typing. Hey.

206
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,753
Stop typing.

207
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,006
Stop typing, "stop typing."

208
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:42,510
Okay, okay, do you see what you're
keeping me married to?

209
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,429
You need to get out of my chambers.

210
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,347
All right, lady, here's the deal.

211
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:50,393
I came here for an annulment,
and I'm not leaving here until I get one.

212
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,521
- Would you like to spend the night in jail?
- Thank you for your time.

213
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,505
That Porsche guy took his car back.

214
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,469
But you found the keys to his clothes?

215
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,639
No, I just, uh...

216
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,350
I love the way it feels when everybody
thinks I own a Porsche.

217
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,019
People would think you own a Porsche
because of the clothes?

218
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,687
Of course.

219
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,858
Only an idiot would wear this stuff
if he didn't have the car.

220
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,072
That is true.

221
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:48,243
Yeah, but only a genius would
swallow a sonic blaster gun.

222
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,286
Oh, I've been there.

223
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,750
I am gonna go drive my Porsche.

224
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,461
Joey, you know you don't
actually have one.

225
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:02,799
Come on. What are you doing?
I'm in character. Will you talk to her?

226
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,594
Ah, I think it just moved.
It's really poking me.

227
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,805
That's it. We're going
to the emergency room.

228
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,642
What? No, you can't leave me here
with them. We're babysitting.

229
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,562
The babies are asleep.
I'm sure you'll be okay on your own.

230
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,273
But you can't leave me with them.
We're a team.

231
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,733
We're playing a zone.
They're gonna triple-team me.

232
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,446
He's got something plastic in his throat.
We gotta go to the hospital.

233
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:29,742
But, no, because a doctor won't be able to
help him. And it's just gonna, you know...

234
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,037
...naturally pass through his system
in, like, seven years.

235
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,292
- I think that's gum.
- I'm pretty sure it's gun.

236
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,004
Okay, listen, this really hurts. Let's go.

237
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:45,133
But no. A real man wouldn't
just run to the hospital.

238
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,969
No. What would Krog do?

239
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:54,183
Why isn't that valet back
with my Porsche?

240
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,520
Maybe because you've got the keys?

241
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,030
- That was totally your fault.
- My fault? You threatened the judge.

242
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,116
Well, you ripped the paper out
of the court reporter's machine.

243
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,368
That was the only way I could
get him to stop typing!

244
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,703
Oh.

245
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,289
Hi. How are the Gellers?

246
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,379
Don't call us that.

247
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:28,051
The judge wouldn't let us get an
annulment. Now we gotta get a divorce.

248
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,095
Did a Porsche throw up on you?

249
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,642
Hey.

250
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,518
It's "Porsche."

251
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,606
Me taking care of you
is no problem, huh?

252
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,567
You guys feel safe, right?

253
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,862
Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble
as a "Yeah, I do."

254
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:52,659
Let's get rid of this dirty diaper, Leslie.
I'll set you up with a nice clean one.

255
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:57,246
Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
I just have to clean that up, okay?

256
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,249
Because, let's face it, we're at Monica's.

257
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,255
I broke it. All right.
Well, that's just the way things go.

258
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,841
Okay. Good.

259
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,178
Why are there only two of you?

260
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,930
Where's Leslie?

261
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,642
Well, you can't answer.
Leslie? Where are you, Leslie?

262
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,937
Leslie, now would be a good time
for your first words.

263
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,024
Well, look at you.

264
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,693
Hey.

265
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,239
You are a little bit mischievous.
My gosh.

266
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,700
Oh, you're a lot mischievous.

267
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,662
Well, it'll dry.

268
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:41,207
Okay, you sit with your brother
and sister now...

269
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,042
...who aren't there.

270
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,266
- Hey.
- How do you feel?

271
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:02,020
Well, let's just say that Krog will be
equipped to destroy the universe again...

272
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,272
...in 12 to 14 hours.

273
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,860
Okay, so I totally took care of the babies
all by myself.

274
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,945
I fed them, bathed them
and put them to bed.

275
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,990
And protected them from a tornado?

276
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:18,870
Oh, my God.

277
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,664
I know. The babies are asleep.

278
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,417
Phoebe, what happened here?

279
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,420
I did it. I took care
of the babies all by myself.

280
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:31,716
- But my apartment.
- Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.

281
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,427
But the mess.

282
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,389
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe
took care of the babies all by herself.

283
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,518
You're right. You're right,
I shouldn't freak out.

284
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,687
This is what it's gonna be like
when we have babies.

285
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,689
When will that be?

286
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,903
Phoebe, would you take a look
at this mess?

287
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,663
Oh, honey, thank God you're home.
I was getting worried.

288
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,084
I picked up the divorce papers.

289
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:12,006
Uh, I've already signed everything.
And I put little X's where you need to sign.

290
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,967
Oh, little X's. Great.
That makes up for everything.

291
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:20,765
You know, you've done
a lot of stupid stuff too, okay?

292
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,810
Oh, name one stupid thing
that is as stupid as this one.

293
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,521
Okay, how about you flew to London
to stop my wedding?

294
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,482
How about you told me you loved me
after I was married?

295
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,692
Wait a minute, that was different.

296
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,362
I did those things
because I was in love with you.

297
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,239
Yeah. Right.

298
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,620
You're right. That's very different.

299
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,997
So let's just sign the papers.

300
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,419
- What?
- Nothing.

301
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,548
Okay, can we just sign, please?

302
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,341
Mm-hm.

303
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,520
Congratulations.

304
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,648
Okay, wait, Ross. Wait a minute. Um...

305
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,026
I, uh, kind of have a little confession.

306
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,695
What?

307
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,614
Uh, well, you know,
this whole marriage thing.

308
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,658
Kind of my idea.

309
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,369
Excuse me?

310
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,122
Remember how we were too drunk
to remember anything...

311
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,832
...the night we were married?

312
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,041
Yeah?

313
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:32,211
And yeah,
I didn't really wanna say anything...

314
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,131
...but it just kind of kept
coming back to me.

315
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,133
Um, remember, we were in the casino...

316
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,386
...and for some reason, you thought it'd
be funny to eat a lot of grapes.

317
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:46,434
And I thought it would be funnier
if we got married.

318
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:51,564
So, ahem, as a compromise, we decided
first to get married and then...

319
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,275
...to eat a lot of grapes.
- To eat a lot of grapes.

320
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,487
So, um...

321
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,782
Sorry I got us into this whole thing.

322
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,161
So then, I mean, if you think about it...

323
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,080
...this is all your fault.

324
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,959
Yeah, don't push it, though.

325
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,505
I gotta say...

326
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,425
...I know I divorce a lot of women.

327
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,556
Never thought I'd be divorcing you.

328
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,391
I know.

329
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:31,646
I always thought if you and I got married,
that would be the one that stuck.

330
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,982
And it wouldn't be a secret...

331
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,526
...and we wouldn't have our
wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.

332
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,323
Did I even treat?

333
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:46,285
No, it was on the house.
It was a newlywed special.

334
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,747
That may be the most depressing thing
I've heard in my life.

335
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,461
Well, I should probably get these
to my lawyer's office.

336
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,631
Hey, thanks, Ross,
for taking care of all this.

337
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,300
- Ah, no problem.
- Yeah.

338
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,770
- I'm gonna need a copy of those.
- Totally.

339
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,230
Yeah.

340
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:23,489
Hey, hey, hey.
Careful around my Porsche.

341
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,451
- Hi, Joey.
- Hey.

342
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,245
How you doing?

343
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,373
He has the most amazing Porsche
under there.

344
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,668
I'd love to show you, but I just tucked
her in. She's sleeping.

345
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,422
Hey, would you two girls
like to go for a drink?
