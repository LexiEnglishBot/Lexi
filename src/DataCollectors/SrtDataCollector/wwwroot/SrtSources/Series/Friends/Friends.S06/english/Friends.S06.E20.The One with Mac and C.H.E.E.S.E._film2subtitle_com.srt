Yeah, you're right.

327
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,041
Look, let's talk about
what a huge star I'm gonna be.

328
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,418
You are gonna be a huge star.
I'm gonna hug you.

329

- Do we do this too much?
- I think so.

I'm not leaving without you.

They're fried, I tell you!"

Ross, you don't have to yell.

Thank you. And I have to say
that first scene where you meet Mac...

- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. I mean...

You know what?

347
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,843
I think that's enough for today.
Thanks for your help.
