1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:03,671
Previously on Friends:

2
00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:06,882
- How did the job stuff go?
- He offered me one!

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,302
You know what?
This calls for a bottle of Israel's finest!

4
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:14,849
The job is in Paris.

5
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:23,190
Oh, God, please,
somebody say something.

6
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:27,319
So if you take this job,
you'll be moving to Paris?

7
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:30,364
Or facing a bitch of a commute.

8
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:37,288
I know, it's huge, and it's scary
and it's really far, far away from you guys.

9
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:39,957
But this is such
an incredible opportunity for me.

10
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,752
And I've already told them about
our situation with Emma.

11
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:46,005
And they said they'll do whatever we need
to make us feel comfortable.

12
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,256
Okay.

13
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:51,052
I mean, I'll fly back and forth,
they'll fly you out. Anything we want.

14
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,263
My boss said I might be getting
a new lamp in my cubicle.

15
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:03,856
- All right. We'll work it out.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

16
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:05,066
Yeah.

17
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:10,905
- You sure this is what you want?
- I think it is.

18
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:18,913
- What's going on?
- I got a really incredible job offer.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,207
- Hey, great! All right!
- Good for you!

20
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,292
- It's in Paris.
- What?

21
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:29,381
No, no, no! No, no, no!
No, no, too much is changing, okay?

22
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:32,259
First Phoebe getting married.
Congratulations.

23
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:36,722
And then these two move in
to a stupid house in the stupid suburbs.

24
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:41,769
- Earlier, you said you'd be supportive.
- It comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.

25
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,731
You guys, this is really,
really important to me.

26
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:48,400
It means a lot if you could try
to get on board.

27
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:52,113
- Of course we can. Congratulations. Yay!
- Thank you.

28
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:53,739
- Joey?
- No, no.No.

29
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:58,077
No, my hugs are reserved
for people staying in America.

30
00:01:58,244 --> 00:01:59,662
- Joey, it would mean...
- Hey!

31
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:02,957
No! Get your France-going arms
away from me!

32
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:04,375
RACHEL
Joey.

33
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:08,129
- Are you okay with this?
- Well, it makes me feel sad, but...

34
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,464
- Talking to Ross.
- I see.

35
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:16,053
Rachel moving to another country?
Not being able to see her every day?

36
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,556
- How could I be okay with this?
- I know.

37
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,183
But what are we gonna do?
She really needs this job.

38
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,604
Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people
offered her her old job back...

39
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,106
...she would take it?

40
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:28,274
How's that gonna happen?

41
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,027
Is this the best way to use
one of your three magic wishes?

42
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:35,239
Like, I don't know,
I could talk to her boss. Yeah.

43
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:38,826
I met him at that Christmas party.
I mean, we really hit it off.

44
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:42,621
- The guy who kept calling you "Ron"?
- I didn't say we were brothers!

45
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,955
Hey, Phoebe.
Hey, tell me what you think.

46
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:28,751
The house next door to the one that
we're buying just went on the market.

47
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:31,212
I wanna take a look at it,
but Chandler doesn't.

48
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,546
We close escrow tomorrow.

49
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,758
Seeing another house can only
confuse us. We're easily confused.

50
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,384
We're not very bright.

51
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,555
But what if it's better than ours?
Shouldn't we look?

52
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,098
What do you think, Pheebs?

53
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:47,436
Well, I think that shirt makes you look
like you should work at a Baskin-Robbins.

54
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:53,067
Anyway...

55
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,239
- Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
- Yeah.

56
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,032
- She died.
- You're kidding.

57
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,660
- That's terrible.
- Yeah, last Saturday.

58
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:07,414
Wow! She was the first black man
to fly solo across the Atlantic.

59
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:13,587
- Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.
- Oh, yeah?

60
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:18,092
- Yeah, she was just an agent.
- Joey's gonna be so upset.

61
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:22,680
I know. He always wanted to be
the first black man to cross the Atlantic.

62
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,766
We cannot tell Joey about this.

63
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,560
He's already flipping out
about everything that's changing.

64
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,521
This will push him over the edge.

65
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:33,315
- You don't think we should tell him?
- Not for a while.

66
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,485
Let's just give him a few days
to get used to everything else.

67
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,028
What if he reads it in the paper?

68
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,824
Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown,
I think we're okay.

69
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,750
- May I help you?
- Yeah. I'm a friend of Rachel Green's.

70
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:55,129
Um, actually, we met at the Christmas party
about two years ago.

71
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:58,590
- Oh, right. Don?
- Close. Ron.

72
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,095
Well, what can I do for you?

73
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:07,975
Um, well, I'm here to see
if you'll give Rachel her job back.

74
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:11,228
Ah, did she ask you
to come here and do this?

75
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,105
No. First I have to get you to agree...

76
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:16,066
...then we'll see
if she wants to come back.

77
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,986
Wow, that is tempting.

78
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:24,408
She loved her job here. Let's face it
you're not gonna find anyone...

79
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:27,036
...who did it as well as she did.
Isn't that true?

80
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:31,248
- She is good.
- Huh. I took a shot there.

81
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,126
But I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.

82
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:38,047
Oh, that's not true.
There's nothing I want to do.

83
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,716
I see.

84
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,802
- Thanks very much.
- Mm-hm.

85
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,934
- Is this your son?
- Yeah, his name is Ross.

86
00:05:55,606 --> 00:06:00,736
- What?
- Nothing, it's just that it's close to Ron.

87
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:06,367
Does he, um...? Does little Ross
like dinosaurs, by any chance?

88
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,328
Yeah, they're all he talks about. Why?

89
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:14,875
How would he like to come with me
to the Museum of Natural History...

90
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:18,754
...after everyone else has left,
just the two of us...

91
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,715
...and he can touch anything he wants?

92
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:30,557
I just heard it how you must
have heard it, and that's not good.

93
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,060
Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist.

94
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:39,149
You'll be there with us, and the touching
refers only to bones... Fossils!

95
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:46,949
- You could really arrange that?
- You let Rachel come back and it's done.

96
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:50,869
Well, I guess having Rachel back
wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

97
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,789
Yes! Thank you! This is great!
Thank you so much.

98
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:56,542
I swear, your kid's gonna have
the time of his life.

99
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,710
That's great. I worry about little Ross.

100
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:02,339
He's always reading, collecting rocks
and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.

101
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:03,632
He'll be fine!

102
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:08,637
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

103
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:11,682
- Everything okay?
- I'm just mad at my agent.

104
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,475
Estelle? Why?

105
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,812
There's a part in this TV movie
that I would be perfect for...

106
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,149
...and I didn't even get put up for it.
She better have a good reason.

107
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,861
I'm guessing she does.

108
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:27,739
Well, I wanna hear it,
because she keeps doing this.

109
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,868
No, wait, wait, wait! All right, I gotta go.

110
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:35,456
Just listen. Promise me that you will
wait a minute before you call her.

111
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,374
Well, Okay. Why?

112
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:43,422
Because a promise between friends
means never having to give a reason.

113
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,053
I love that saying!

114
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:01,398
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Estelle.

115
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,693
I was just gonna call you. That's weird.

116
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:08,572
It's a little coincidental, but believable.

117
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,535
Listen, I'm sure you're wondering
why I didn't get you...

118
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,996
...an audition for that TV movie.

119
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,456
Yeah, actually I am.

120
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:21,793
I guess I dropped the ball there.
Whoopsie!

121
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:26,423
That's it? You know, it seems like
all you do lately is drop the ball.

122
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,635
Don't take that tone with me.
Who do you think you are?

123
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:35,098
Alan Lemon, the first black man
to fly solo across the Atlantic?

124
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:39,353
No, look, all I'm saying is
you're my agent...

125
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,523
...and you're not getting me
any auditions and I'm tired of it.

126
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:43,815
What are you saying?

127
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:47,819
I'm saying that this isn't working
for me anymore, okay, Estelle?

128
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,696
You're fired. Goodbye.

129
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,785
Man, tough week for Estelle.

130
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,207
- Hi.
- Hi.

131
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,834
Um, Emma left her stuffed T. rex
at my house.

132
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:07,798
- You know she can't sleep without it.
- Ah. Well, she's asleep now.

133
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:11,218
- Stop forcing that thing on her.
- Okay.

134
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,971
Oh! You're not gonna believe
what happened to me today!

135
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,266
Ralph Lauren called
and gave me my job back.

136
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:21,562
- No!
- I mean, it was the weirdest thing.

137
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,815
They fire me and then out of nowhere,
they just hire me back.

138
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,901
I mean, that place must just be
falling apart without me!

139
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,488
- So you're not going to Paris?
- No, I'm still going.

140
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,411
What?

141
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:40,581
Well, when the Louis Vuitton people
found out...

142
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:44,334
...that Ralph Lauren wanted me back,
they offered me more money!

143
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,004
Ross, isn't that great?

144
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,673
Yay!

145
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,140
Hi. We're buying the house next door...

146
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,517
...and we were wondering
if we could take a look around?

147
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:03,520
I'm showing it to someone else,
but please, look around.

148
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:04,730
Thanks.

149
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,232
I feel like we're cheating on our house.

150
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,569
If we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be
with a hot, younger house...

151
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:13,322
...that does stuff
that our house won't do?

152
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,201
Ours is so much better.

153
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:22,247
This living room is smaller,
the dining room looks like a cave.

154
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:23,707
What a hole!

155
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:27,669
- So, what do you think?
- Loveit

156
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,673
We already have one offer. I think the lady
upstairs is gonna make another one.

157
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,800
They could be our neighbors.
What are they like?

158
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,054
The woman upstairs is nice.
She and her husband have two kids.

159
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:42,934
- Uh, he's on Wall Street, and she's a...
- Oh, my God!

160
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,237
Sure.

161
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,120
Hey, Joey, you wanna
come with me to...?

162
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:03,955
Are you okay?

163
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:07,292
Yeah, I just feel bad about firing Estelle.

164
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,878
This has gotta be killing her.

165
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,217
No, that wouldn't kill her.

166
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,761
A coronary embolism might.

167
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:21,807
I don't know. She's gotta be taking it hard.
I was, like, her only client.

168
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,101
Except for this guy who eats paper.

169
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,478
And I'm guessing he eats more money
than he makes.

170
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:31,400
Look, I know she's not a great agent,
but she did stick with me for 10 years.

171
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:36,780
- I'm gonna call her and hire her again.
- No, no, no! Don't call her.

172
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:40,659
- You wait for her to call you.
- Why?

173
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:45,706
Because patience is the road
to understanding.

174
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:50,627
Which is the key to a happy heart.

175
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,465
You blow me away.

176
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,593
All right, so promise you're gonna wait
for her to call you?

177
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,970
- I promise.
- Okay.

178
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:04,391
And that means never having
to give a reason.

179
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,480
What a small world!

180
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,734
And yet I never run into Beyoncé.

181
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:16,903
You two know each other?

182
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,365
Oh, we go way back. Before Monica
made an honest man out of him...

183
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,201
...Chandler used to be
my little love muffin.

184
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,957
So are you guys thinking
of getting this house too?

185
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:32,794
Are we gonna have a bidding war?
I better warn you, I'm a toughie.

186
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,796
Don't. Don't. Don't.

187
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,424
No, actually, we are buying
the house next door.

188
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,926
Why?

189
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,639
I don't know why.

190
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:48,310
Oh, that decides it, then!
I was on the fence.

191
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:51,104
But knowing that you two
would be our neighbors?

192
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,482
Now we have to get it.

193
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,776
Ellen, we're gonna talk numbers.

194
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,908
This cannot be happening.

195
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,535
Okay, the realtor said another couple
made an offer.

196
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:10,373
Maybe the Janices won't get it!
Maybe the other couple will.

197
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,003
The only way that that is going to happen
is if the other couple are the Hitlers!

198
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:20,675
Okay, okay! All right,
what if we get both houses?

199
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:24,054
- We can turn this one into a guesthouse!
- That's a great idea!

200
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,640
By the way,
I don't mean to sound distasteful...

201
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,059
...but when did you start
crapping money?

202
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,479
- You come up with an idea.
- All right.

203
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:36,066
We've still got three hours
till escrow closes on our house.

204
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,443
- We can still get out.
- But we love our house.

205
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,612
Will we love it so much
with her next door?

206
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,864
And she's gonna be louder
out here too!

207
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,493
Just the crickets and, "Oh, my God!"

208
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:51,039
Okay. But if we don't get this house,
she's still gonna show up wherever we go.

209
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:54,292
At least if she's here,
it eliminates the element of surprise.

210
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,962
Never again will you have to hear
the three words...

211
00:13:57,128 --> 00:14:00,215
...that make your balls jump back up
inside your body!

212
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:09,224
Well, we have to do something.
We can't have her living next door.

213
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,939
Oh, that does it too.

214
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:24,239
Who is it?

215
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:26,032
It's me. Ron.

216
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,453
Look, I know Rachel turned you down...

217
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,541
...but I think there's a way you might
be able to get her to come back.

218
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:40,964
This may surprise you, but rehiring
fired employees is not my main job.

219
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,841
Just hear me out.

220
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:47,304
How would you feel
about offering her a raise?

221
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,560
Not good, Ron.

222
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,897
Perhaps I can persuade you.

223
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,733
What if you could give your son...

224
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:05,697
...this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.

225
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,998
Wow. That's pretty cool.

226
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:18,668
Huh? So? Do we have a deal?

227
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:22,464
- Qkay, you got it.
- Yes! Yes!

228
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:25,759
- This is gonna make me very popular.
- Oh.

229
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:28,219
Believe me, the ladies, they love it.

230
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,018
I meant with my son.

231
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,604
Good, because the ladies, not so much.

232
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,740
Joey, this is AI Zebooker...

233
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:51,076
...the guy who eats paper.

234
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,537
I'm sure you've heard
that Estelle passed away.

235
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,332
I wanted to let you know
there's a memorial for her...

236
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:01,044
...at the Westside Chapel tomorrow at 10.

237
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,046
Hope you can make it.

238
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,007
Oh, my God.

239
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:17,769
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Estelle.

240
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,776
Estelle?

241
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:30,323
Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that
there's no hard feelings for firing me.

242
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:39,040
Okay. I just...
I can't believe you're calling me.

243
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,209
I didn't think I should just drop by.

244
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:44,254
No, no! Don't drop by! Don't drop by!

245
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,714
No.No.No.

246
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,176
Anyway, you did what you had to do.
I'm okay.

247
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,929
Can I ask you something? Um...

248
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,223
What's it like there?

249
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,976
It's all right.

250
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,146
Look, kiddo, I gotta go.

251
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:04,566
Good luck with the career.
You're gonna be huge!

252
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:08,361
Thanks for everything, Estelle. Bye.

253
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:13,533
"Out of area." Boy, I'll say.

254
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,249
Well, I just talked to Sid.

255
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,044
We are definitely putting in
an offer on the house.

256
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,171
And I'll bet we get it!

257
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:29,174
The Hitlers will be so disappointed.

258
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:34,679
All right, I gotta run.
Tell Monica I say goodbye.

259
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:37,557
And I'll see you later, neighbor. Ha, ha.

260
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,601
Wait!

261
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:44,773
I just want you to know that
I'm so happy you're going to be here.

262
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,067
Oh, me too.

263
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,985
Because...

264
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,029
...that way...

265
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,491
...we can pick up where we left off.

266
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:01,289
- Huh?
- I never stopped loving you.

267
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:04,292
- Oh, my...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

268
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,005
I want you.

269
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:10,882
I need you.

270
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:16,054
I must have you,
Janice Litman-Goralnik neé Hosenstein.

271
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:22,393
Chandler, what are you talking about?

272
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:26,397
Now that you live next door,
we can be together every day.

273
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,067
Sid and Monica never have
to know a thing.

274
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,694
I don't know what to say.

275
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:38,618
I mean, you know, obviously
we have this heat between us.

276
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,500
Obviously.

277
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,837
But I love my husband.

278
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,381
And I know you love your wife.

279
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:54,342
I don't think we should get
this house now.

280
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:57,679
Don't say that. Don't dangle the dream
and take it away.

281
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:02,433
Chandler, one of us
has got to be strong.

282
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,811
I understand.

283
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,064
Although...

284
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,985
Maybe just one last moment
of weakness.

285
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,750
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.

286
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,924
They're never coming down now!

287
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:39,512
- Hi.
- Hi!

288
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,349
You are never going to believe
what happened to me today.

289
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,559
What?

290
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:48,438
Ralph Lauren called, again,
and they offered me more money.

291
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:53,151
- They did?
- Yes! It was the weirdest thing.

292
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:57,030
Zelner called me and said, "We will
do anything we can to get you back."

293
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,741
And that I should thank some "Ron."

294
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:02,327
I don't even know
what department that guy's in!

295
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,998
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Well, I took it!

296
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,500
That's great!
So you're staying in New York!

297
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,467
- You're excited, right?
- Yeah.

298
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,636
Yeah, you know...
Look, the money's great.

299
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:23,097
- It's certainly the easier choice.
- Right.

300
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:27,685
But, you know, I mean, was I looking
forward to going to Paris? Sure.

301
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:31,773
You know, was I excited about working
in the fashion capital of the world?

302
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,483
Oh, absolutely.

303
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,361
Oh...

304
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,531
Yeah, but you know, this is...

305
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:45,495
It's fine. I'm fine going back
to a job where I've pretty much...

306
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:49,165
...gotten everything out of it
that I possibly can.

307
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,754
Um, I had really...

308
00:20:56,547 --> 00:21:01,678
I had no idea you were
so excited about Paris.

309
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,847
Um, I mean, you said you were scared.

310
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,809
Well, yeah, I mean, it was "good" scared,
though, you know?

311
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,770
I mean, like "when I moved
to New York" scared.

312
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:14,941
Or, uh, "when I found out I was
gonna have Emma" scared.

313
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:22,115
But this is fine. This is gonna be good.

314
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:30,206
You should go.

315
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,834
What?

316
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:37,505
It's what you want. You should go.

317
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,174
You really think so?

318
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:43,052
I really do.

319
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,015
But I already told Zelner
that I would come back.

320
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,101
I'm sure he'll understand.

321
00:21:55,815 --> 00:22:01,070
All right. All right! I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna go to Paris.

322
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,823
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

323
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,367
I'm going to Paris!

324
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:09,162
- Thank you, Ross.
- Yeah, yeah.

325
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,789
Oh.

326
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,834
Oh, I'm so happy-

327
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:18,171
Then I'm happy too.

328
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:31,559
Thank you all for coming.

329
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:35,563
We're here today to pay our respects
to a wonderful agent...

330
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,774
...and a beautiful woman.

331
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,777
