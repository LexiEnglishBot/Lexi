1
00:00:05,073 --> 00:00:10,280
The caterer sent me this list of 12
appetizers. I have to narrow it to six.

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,622
Food? Oh, give me.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,072
Did Monica mention we're trying to get
The Swing Kings to play the wedding?

4
00:00:18,363 --> 00:00:19,952
You're into swing music?

5
00:00:20,172 --> 00:00:23,755
I used to go all over town
listening to bands.

6
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:27,295
- Chandler?
- Gap commercial.

7
00:00:29,287 --> 00:00:32,763
- Did you book them? Did you call?
- I will.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,314
- You want me to call?
- I'll do it. You stick to your job.

9
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:40,521
- What is your job?
- Staying out of the way.

10
00:00:41,673 --> 00:00:45,563
This is impossible.
Why don't you just pick all 15.

11
00:00:45,883 --> 00:00:49,394
- There were only 12.
- Oh, yeah, I added three.

12
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:52,178
What are peanut-butter fingers?

13
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:03,094
The One With the
Cheap Wedding Dress

14
00:01:40,227 --> 00:01:42,374
Well, hello.

15
00:01:42,628 --> 00:01:44,396
She's cute.

16
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,757
Should we go try to talk to her?

17
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:52,194
Sure. Being engaged, I'm not nervous
talking to pretty girls anymore.

18
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,454
Could you guys help me?

19
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,705
Yeah, let me get that for you.

20
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:03,667
- It's really heavy.
- I got it.

21
00:02:06,947 --> 00:02:11,503
So hi, I'm Ross,
and this is my friend Chandler.

22
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:15,459
I'm Kristen.

23
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:18,111
Kristen, hi. Are you new to the area?

24
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,418
Because if you are, I'd love
to show you around sometime.

25
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,104
I actually just moved
from four blocks over.

26
00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:27,854
But this block is like another world.

27
00:02:28,205 --> 00:02:32,095
Actually, it does have
a very interesting history.

28
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:37,695
This street is the first in the city
to have an underground sewer system.

29
00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:41,038
Before that, sewage and waste...

30
00:02:41,357 --> 00:02:44,512
...would just flow
right down the street.

31
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:47,399
Sometimes ankle-deep.

32
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:50,112
Smooth.

33
00:02:51,863 --> 00:02:53,701
Excuse me?

34
00:02:56,491 --> 00:03:01,805
You're gonna be starving after moving.
What do you say I take you to dinner?

35
00:03:02,092 --> 00:03:03,752
- I'd like that.
- Great.

36
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,250
Let me take this up.

37
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:08,693
- After you.
- Oh, no. After you.

38
00:03:10,478 --> 00:03:12,209
Oh, my God!

39
00:03:20,288 --> 00:03:23,479
Am I crazy, or does this totally go?

40
00:03:24,812 --> 00:03:29,260
Oh, my God! You look so beautiful!

41
00:03:29,474 --> 00:03:32,735
Thank you, Rachel.
But look at Monica!

42
00:03:33,787 --> 00:03:36,907
This is it. Yeah, this is the one.

43
00:03:37,197 --> 00:03:39,379
I can't believe I found it.

44
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:44,294
Wow, you look so beautiful.
If I knew you, I'd cry.

45
00:03:44,677 --> 00:03:47,903
I'm Monica Geller. Ball like a baby.

46
00:03:48,157 --> 00:03:49,509
I'm Megan Bailey.

47
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:53,363
- Have you found your dress?
- These dresses are amazing...

48
00:03:53,654 --> 00:03:57,200
...but I couldn't afford one.
- I can't either.

49
00:03:57,481 --> 00:04:02,273
I'm here to figure out which one I
want, then I'll get it at Kleinman's.

50
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,741
They're having a huge sale.

51
00:04:05,031 --> 00:04:08,329
- Thanks for the tip.
- When are you getting married?

52
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:13,584
- I'm not. I just like to try these on.
- I do the same thing.

53
00:04:14,494 --> 00:04:18,348
I'm just kidding.
I'm getting married July 25.

54
00:04:19,156 --> 00:04:21,302
I'm just kidding too.

55
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:24,164
I'm getting married in December.

56
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,653
- When are you getting married?
- May 15.

57
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:31,470
It's getting close.
Who's your photographer?

58
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:33,482
- Jeffrey.
- We met with him.

59
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:38,808
- Did he show you nude wedding photos?
- The best man? Wow!

60
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:42,255
I know.
I almost called off my wedding.

61
00:04:42,536 --> 00:04:46,047
- Who's your band?
- My fiancé wants The Swing Kings.

62
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:50,397
You're lucky. My fiancé wants
the heavy metal band, Carcass.

63
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:55,436
Is that spelled with a C or a K?
It doesn't matter, they're both great!

64
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:59,305
Oh, don't buy that here.

65
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:03,132
Now that you know what you want,
go to Kleinman's.

66
00:05:03,411 --> 00:05:05,487
This place is so overpriced.

67
00:05:05,742 --> 00:05:07,686
I own this store.

68
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:12,835
So does this come
in another color, or...?

69
00:05:22,477 --> 00:05:25,668
Hi. You moving in or moving out?

70
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,868
- Moving in.
- Can I give you a hand?

71
00:05:28,113 --> 00:05:32,905
Okay, but be careful. Guy who was helping
me had to leave because he hurt his back.

72
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:35,478
- Boyfriend?
- No.

73
00:05:35,732 --> 00:05:37,392
I'm Joey.

74
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:39,142
Kristen.

75
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:42,197
What a beautiful name.

76
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:45,160
What is it again?

77
00:05:46,135 --> 00:05:47,867
Kristen.

78
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:52,075
- You live around here?
- Right down there.

79
00:05:52,363 --> 00:05:54,166
Let me give you a little tip.

80
00:05:54,485 --> 00:05:59,136
Don't take a nap on this stoop.
You could wake up with your shoes gone.

81
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:01,649
I'll remember that.

82
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:06,485
Listen, would you like
to have dinner with me tonight?

83
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,887
I have plans tonight.
How about tomorrow?

84
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:12,679
Sounds great.
Well, where does this go?

85
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,601
You look strong. Why don't I take that,
and you grab one of the boxes.

86
00:06:21,553 --> 00:06:23,842
Yeah, I'll get this one.

87
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:35,572
So this is Brooklyn?

88
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:39,850
Listen up. There's usually only
one dress in each size.

89
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:43,536
So when they open those doors,
fan out.

90
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:48,644
This is what you're looking for.
Memorize it.

91
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:54,007
When you locate the dress,
blow on these, all right?

92
00:06:55,127 --> 00:06:59,361
Three sharp blasts.
When you hear it, come running.

93
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:01,595
Here he comes!

94
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:05,067
- They're pushing!
- Don't be a baby!

95
00:07:05,322 --> 00:07:07,789
- Out of the way!
- Let's go!

96
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:11,119
Rachel?! Come on!

97
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:23,934
No, not it. Not it. Not it.

98
00:07:26,683 --> 00:07:28,760
Don't crowd me.

99
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:34,361
This is it! This is the dress!
It's perfect!

100
00:07:34,651 --> 00:07:36,703
I'm sorry, this one's taken!

101
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,663
- Megan!
- Monica!

102
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:42,537
- You came!
- Yeah!

103
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:45,494
- This is my dress!
- No!

104
00:07:45,818 --> 00:07:49,638
- Yes it is. You saw me wearing it.
- And now you'll see me buying it.

105
00:07:49,924 --> 00:07:52,036
You freak!

106
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:55,037
You wouldn't even know
about this place without me.

107
00:07:55,352 --> 00:08:00,702
- Look, you don't want to fight me.
- Maybe I do. I'm pretty feisty!

108
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:04,431
- I'm coming! I'm coming!
- Hey!

109
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:09,788
Okay! Hey? Oh, what do I do?!

110
00:08:16,157 --> 00:08:20,320
What are you doing?
Did you find the dress?

111
00:08:20,645 --> 00:08:21,961
Did you find the dress?

112
00:08:22,245 --> 00:08:24,499
No. Get me out of here.
These shoppers are crazy.

113
00:08:24,785 --> 00:08:28,190
- We've gotta get Monica.
- You gotta hold my hand!

114
00:08:30,004 --> 00:08:32,744
Excuse me! Excuse me!

115
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:36,959
Go! Go! Go!

116
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:51,046
So, Ross, how was your date
the other night?

117
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:56,302
Did you tell her about the magical
ride that starts with every flush?

118
00:08:57,977 --> 00:09:02,627
Laugh all you want, but she said
she'd like to go out again.

119
00:09:03,648 --> 00:09:06,221
In fact, I'll go call her right now.

120
00:09:06,535 --> 00:09:10,984
And I'll make sure and tell her my
friend Chandler says...

121
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:19,578
Sorry I didn't stop by last night,
but I had a date.

122
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:24,025
When it's 1:00 in the morning and you
don't come by, that's okay.

123
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:29,141
It was with this really hot girl who
just moved in right across the street.

124
00:09:29,463 --> 00:09:32,133
- Really? Right across the street?
- Yeah.

125
00:09:32,386 --> 00:09:34,639
- When did you meet her?
- Two days ago.

126
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:37,463
Excellent!

127
00:09:38,543 --> 00:09:41,010
You know, Ross met somebody too.

128
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:42,608
- Hey.
- How'd it go?

129
00:09:42,892 --> 00:09:44,945
Great. We're going out again Saturday.

130
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:49,981
But I just found out she's
also seeing some other guy.

131
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:53,746
Really?

132
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:59,139
Joe, what would you do
if you were in Ross' situation?

133
00:09:59,384 --> 00:10:03,655
I sort of am. I'm dating this girl
who's also seeing another guy.

134
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:06,018
But I'm not worried about it.

135
00:10:06,308 --> 00:10:11,479
You shouldn't be. I wouldn't want
to be the guy who's up against you.

136
00:10:12,814 --> 00:10:16,005
I mean, that doofus is going to lose.

137
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:20,879
So this is nice.

138
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:26,625
I wish I didn't have to go.
Believe me.

139
00:10:26,904 --> 00:10:28,043
But I have to.

140
00:10:28,331 --> 00:10:31,213
By the way, what's the name
of the girl you're dating?

141
00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:34,034
- Kristen Leigh.
- Bye.

142
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,025
Well, obviously only one of us
can keep dating her.

143
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:48,985
Obviously. So how do we decide?

144
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:52,681
Well, now,
let's look at this objectively.

145
00:10:52,964 --> 00:10:55,181
I think I should date her.

146
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:02,246
Or I'm the one who dates her.

147
00:11:02,636 --> 00:11:07,048
That's interesting.
But check this out. I date her.

148
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,008
Okay, but to go
in another direction...

149
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:12,614
Okay. This can go on for a while.

150
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,924
- We should order some food, then.
- No, Joey.

151
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:21,001
Look, why don't we
just let her decide, okay?

152
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:24,095
We'll each go out with her
one more time.

153
00:11:24,415 --> 00:11:26,882
And we'll see who she likes best.

154
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:30,251
That sounds fair.

155
00:11:30,643 --> 00:11:34,320
Maybe I'll take her
to that new French restaurant.

156
00:11:34,574 --> 00:11:37,729
Wait a second. We have
to set a spending limit on the date.

157
00:11:38,053 --> 00:11:41,078
I don't have the money to take her
to a fancy place like that.

158
00:11:41,323 --> 00:11:45,143
Well, sorry.
That's what I do on dates.

159
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:49,949
Well, I guess I'll just have to do
what I do on dates.

160
00:11:55,657 --> 00:11:59,062
- So let's decide on a spending limit.
- Yeah.

161
00:12:02,895 --> 00:12:05,528
And a slice...

162
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,909
...$6?

163
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:13,669
- I was thinking more like 100.
- Okay.

164
00:12:13,993 --> 00:12:16,698
Can I borrow $94?

165
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:27,064
I know. Can you hand me a tissue?

166
00:12:35,007 --> 00:12:37,260
You're out of Diet Coke.

167
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:41,861
Hello?

168
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,098
What? You what?

169
00:12:46,384 --> 00:12:48,116
You listen here, missy!

170
00:12:51,743 --> 00:12:55,669
That was Megan. She booked The Swing
Kings on the day of our wedding...

171
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:59,393
...and said I couldn't have them back
unless I gave her the dress!

172
00:12:59,744 --> 00:13:02,626
Does that mean Carcass is available?

173
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:08,753
What am I gonna do? That's the dress!
That is the dress!

174
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:12,784
Chandler wants the band.
What do I do?

175
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:16,854
- Figure out a way to talk him out of it.
- How?

176
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,216
You're out of toilet paper!

177
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:31,781
I wanted to wish you good luck
on your date.

178
00:13:32,101 --> 00:13:34,212
- Thanks.
- What time are you meeting?

179
00:13:34,536 --> 00:13:37,597
We have 8:00 reservations
at Grand Merci Bistro.

180
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:41,139
That's in 20 minutes.
You'd better get dressed.

181
00:13:42,608 --> 00:13:46,154
- I am dressed.
- Oh, well, good.

182
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:48,379
For me.

183
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,281
What's this?
Did you give yourself a facial?

184
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:56,105
I have an oily T-zone.

185
00:13:57,221 --> 00:13:59,273
Okay, dude.

186
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:05,181
- You sent Kristen flowers?
- That's right.

187
00:14:05,813 --> 00:14:10,191
You spent $ 100.
That's the limit. You're screwed!

188
00:14:11,102 --> 00:14:15,206
I sent the flowers before
the actual date, so technically...

189
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:18,332
...I didn't break any rules.

190
00:14:18,617 --> 00:14:20,562
Thanks for stopping by, though.

191
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:24,178
That's the way it's gonna be?
I can break the rules too.

192
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:26,929
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

193
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:30,235
- Why am I not surprised?
- Not gonna let you get away with this.

194
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:33,601
- I don't think you have much choice.
- We'll see!

195
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:38,508
Hey! So, just a light layer?

196
00:14:38,831 --> 00:14:41,369
Yeah, just here and there.

197
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:51,589
Joey got meat sauce
on the banister again.

198
00:14:52,956 --> 00:14:54,795
Swing music is so out.

199
00:14:55,044 --> 00:14:58,448
He's gotta be in the room
for that to work.

200
00:14:59,427 --> 00:15:01,859
What are you guys talking about?

201
00:15:02,072 --> 00:15:04,574
We're talking about The Swing Kings...

202
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,560
...and wondering whether they're
the right way to go.

203
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:11,252
I went to a wedding once
where they had swing music...

204
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,169
...and two months later,
the couple divorced.

205
00:15:14,423 --> 00:15:17,756
I'm not saying
there's any connection here...

206
00:15:18,076 --> 00:15:21,338
...but they did tell me
that's why they got divorced.

207
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:24,676
But I love swing music!

208
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,519
But The Swing Kings?

209
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:32,194
They suck so much that people die at
their concerts. They just stop living.

210
00:15:33,036 --> 00:15:36,298
All I know is that when Monica
and I went to see them, we had fun.

211
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,210
And there's another reason.

212
00:15:38,464 --> 00:15:42,771
- Well, what is the other reason?
- I don't want to say.

213
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:46,567
Well, you have to
because maybe it's stupid.

214
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:52,439
It's just, while Monica and I
were dancing to them...

215
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:55,894
...it was the first time
I knew that...

216
00:15:56,451 --> 00:16:00,864
...you were the woman that I wanted
to dance all my dances with.

217
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:05,627
Oh, crap.

218
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:17,392
- Our table will be ready in a few minutes.
- Oh, great.

219
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:20,830
- Is your back feeling better?
- Yeah, that's fine.

220
00:16:21,084 --> 00:16:23,860
I guess the more muscles you have...

221
00:16:24,145 --> 00:16:28,214
...the more they can
spasm out of control.

222
00:16:29,051 --> 00:16:31,340
- Kristen?
- Joey!

223
00:16:34,653 --> 00:16:37,642
- What are you doing here?
- I like this place.

224
00:16:37,923 --> 00:16:42,609
And technically, I'm not
breaking any rules, so...

225
00:16:42,863 --> 00:16:47,062
Well, Ross, this is Joey.
Joey, Ross.

226
00:16:47,386 --> 00:16:49,984
- Hi.
- Hi. It's nice to meet you.

227
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,464
I used to have a friend named Joey.

228
00:16:54,693 --> 00:16:57,018
I don't anymore.

229
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:01,439
Our table will be ready
in a couple minutes.

230
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:05,719
Sure, I would love
to wait with you guys! Thanks!

231
00:17:09,688 --> 00:17:12,463
So, Joey, you look familiar.

232
00:17:12,749 --> 00:17:15,454
Are you on TV or something?

233
00:17:15,706 --> 00:17:17,853
Joey doesn't like to talk about it...

234
00:17:18,176 --> 00:17:21,510
...but he's one of the stars
of Days of Our Lives.

235
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:26,595
That's right. Don't you play a woman?

236
00:17:29,658 --> 00:17:32,683
A woman in a man's body.

237
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:35,051
Much better.

238
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:39,224
It's funny, because you
look familiar to me too.

239
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:41,936
Have you ever been married?

240
00:17:43,714 --> 00:17:44,723
Yes, I have.

241
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:47,219
In fact, just the other day...

242
00:17:47,507 --> 00:17:51,611
...Kris and I were talking about how
I've been married and how I have a son.

243
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,888
- Little Eric.
- That's right. Wait. No, Ben.

244
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,795
So you've just been married
the one time, then?

245
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:07,920
- Well...
- You've been married twice?

246
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:11,885
Yes. And...

247
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:14,772
...another time after that.

248
00:18:16,836 --> 00:18:19,790
Boy, I'm getting hungry.

249
00:18:20,106 --> 00:18:23,131
Have you ever been so hungry
on a date...

250
00:18:23,446 --> 00:18:27,823
...that when the girl goes to the
bathroom, you eat her food?

251
00:18:30,335 --> 00:18:33,597
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.

252
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:40,556
So, Ross, now why did
that first marriage break up?

253
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:45,851
Was it because the woman was straight
or because she was a lesbian?

254
00:18:47,383 --> 00:18:50,539
- Do you two know each other?
- No.

255
00:18:50,793 --> 00:18:53,569
Just seems like Ross is the kind of guy
who'd marry a woman...

256
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:58,303
...on the verge of being a lesbian
and then push her over the edge.

257
00:19:01,335 --> 00:19:05,854
Wait a minute!
Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?

258
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:12,328
Have you ever slept
in the same bed with a monkey?

259
00:19:13,163 --> 00:19:15,452
You leave Marcel out of this!

260
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:19,252
Fine! You ever gotten stuck
in a pair of your own leather pants?

261
00:19:19,565 --> 00:19:24,121
Have you ever locked yourself
in a TV cabinet, VD-boy?

262
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:26,513
Monkey-lover!

263
00:19:34,421 --> 00:19:36,782
Where do you think we lost her?

264
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:39,742
Probably around gonorrhea.

265
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:44,676
Geller, table of two?

266
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,848
- You hungry?
- Does a bear shit in the woods?

267
00:19:58,775 --> 00:20:01,480
- Hi, honey, I'm home!
- Don't come in here!

268
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:05,586
Why, do you have another
boyfriend in there?

269
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:08,792
No. We only mess around at his place.

270
00:20:09,734 --> 00:20:14,634
I started it, but now it's scaring me,
so could you come out here, please?

271
00:20:14,989 --> 00:20:16,613
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.

272
00:20:16,902 --> 00:20:18,598
You got a wedding dress?

273
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:22,421
- Yeah, but I'm not keeping it.
- Then why can't I see it?

274
00:20:22,712 --> 00:20:24,515
Oh. I guess you can.

275
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,861
But I have to return it,
so you can't like it.

276
00:20:28,105 --> 00:20:31,260
Okay, I promise. I'll hate it.

277
00:20:36,872 --> 00:20:41,143
Wow. You look hideous.

278
00:20:41,743 --> 00:20:42,882
Really?

279
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:48,069
Yeah. That's like the most
ugliest dress I've ever seen.

280
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,263
Why do you have to return it?

281
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,534
Because it doesn't really fit.

282
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:55,763
Oh, by the way, I
booked The Swing Kings.

283
00:20:56,043 --> 00:20:58,925
Oh, that's great. Thanks.

284
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:01,808
But that dress is terrible.

285
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:05,571
- It makes me want to rip it off you.
- Okay.

286
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,516
But you can't rip it.

287
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:09,534
Well, maybe a little.

288
00:21:17,857 --> 00:21:21,783
Guys, you want to look
at the song list for the wedding?

289
00:21:22,345 --> 00:21:23,449
Guys?

290
00:21:23,668 --> 00:21:25,814
I thought you were
gonna be gone all day.

291
00:21:26,102 --> 00:21:28,735
All right, what's going on?

292
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:41,062
I'm sorry. I should probably
leave you girls alone.

293
00:21:41,794 --> 00:21:46,871
Laugh all you want, but in 10 minutes,
we'll have younger-looking skin.

294
00:21:50,213 --> 00:21:52,538
You know, she could use a little...

295
00:21:53,588 --> 00:21:55,913
Oh, nice shot! Yeah!
