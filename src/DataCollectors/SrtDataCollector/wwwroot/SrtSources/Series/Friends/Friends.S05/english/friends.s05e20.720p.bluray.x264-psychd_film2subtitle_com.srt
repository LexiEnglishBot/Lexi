1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,628
Okay, guys, listen.

2
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:07,381
Tomorrow, Emily gets married again.

3
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:10,426
So try to really keep
Ross' mind off of it.

4
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:12,052
- Okay.
- Good idea.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,804
Hey, man. What's up?

6
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,808
Just thinking about Emily
getting married tomorrow.

7
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,980
Oh, Ross. Look, look.

8
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,441
What? Where?

9
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:28,193
Right over there. There.
Look, look, look.

10
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,531
- What am I looking at?
- Somebody help me out here.

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,035
- Hey.
- Hey.

12
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,163
Monica, sorry I didn't come by.
I was out with Gary.

13
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:43,834
He let me ride around with him.
We saw and prevented crimes.

14
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,170
- You got to go on a ride-along?
- Uh-huh.

15
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,839
- I want to go on a ride-along.
- Me too.

16
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,716
- Okay.
- Yeah. Me too.

17
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,676
Really? You?

18
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,472
Yeah.

19
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,517
- Well, it's kind of dangerous.
- Well, I like danger.

20
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,896
- Okay, you guys free tonight?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,608
You didn't say
it was gonna be at nighttime.

22
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,621
- Hey.
- Hey.

23
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,624
I'm glad you're home.
We can finally organize these photos.

24
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,835
Oh, thank God.

25
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,170
Finally.

26
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,090
I've broken them down
into categories.

27
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:16,176
We got holidays,
birthdays, candids...

28
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,762
And I've cross-referenced them
by subject.

29
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,014
So if you're looking up, say...

30
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,143
...birthdays and dogs,
you get photo 152.

31
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,435
See?

32
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,231
Oh, it's me and LePoo.

33
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,733
Wow, I miss that dog.

34
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,903
You can also find him
under "dog" and "dead."

35
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,198
Great. Thanks.

36
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:42,244
Hand me that other box of photos.
That's the last one.

37
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,668
Oops.

38
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,170
Sorry.

39
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,213
Good thing you numbered them.

40
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,464
I hadn't.

41
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,426
Photo 152 was a prototype.

42
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,054
Honey, it's okay. It's okay.

43
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,474
How about I fix you a drink?
Maybe a margarita?

44
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,518
Ross has the blender.

45
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:10,105
Everything's just falling apart.

46
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,859
It's okay. I'll go to Ross',
get the blender.

47
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,570
- You get the margarita stuff ready.
- All right.

48
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,656
His keys are in the drawer.
Also, I need some cash.

49
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,241
Want me to stop at the ATM?

50
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,786
No. While you're at Ross',
if you see any lying around.

51
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,665
- What?
- What?

52
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,834
I don't do that.

53
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,556
That was so cool, man.
The way you leaned on that guy.

54
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,309
It is starting to get dark out there.

55
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,646
He told you everything.
You cracked him.

56
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,149
He was the victim.
They're usually pretty talkative.

57
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,945
Okay, but it is officially nighttime.

58
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,532
- Want me to grab the berry?
- It's called a cherry.

59
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,160
It's called... Chandler.

60
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,292
Okay, I got it.

61
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,796
This place makes
the best sandwich in the world.

62
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,756
Does it have meatballs?

63
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:18,966
Oh, yeah.

64
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,801
Melted cheese and marinara sauce?

65
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,302
Yep.

66
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,263
You can't eat that in my car.

67
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,308
Yeah, okay.

68
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,728
Even though my tax dollars
paid for this car.

69
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,606
Your tax dollars?

70
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,777
Yeah, okay.

71
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,452
Wow, that sandwich smells good.

72
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,579
Did I say you could smell it?

73
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,915
I can't smell it?

74
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:56,712
Half the taste is in the smell.
You're sucking up all the taste units.

75
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,880
Okay, I'll give them back.

76
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,303
What is so great about that sandwich?

77
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,516
- Okay. Imagine the best sex you ever had.
- Okay.

78
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,977
- Are you thinking about Monica?
- Yeah.

79
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,353
What's that like?

80
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,828
Please don't be from a real dinosaur.
Please, please.

81
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,665
Please, please, please.

82
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,168
"Made in Mexico." Yes!

83
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,422
Who would buy this?

84
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,556
Rach, it's me. Pick up.

85
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,268
What's up?

86
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,437
I need more margarita things.

87
00:05:55,688 --> 00:06:00,817
I need some salt,
some margarita mix and tequila.

88
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,779
So all we had was ice?

89
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,530
See if he has ice.

90
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,741
Okay.

91
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,754
Hello, Ross?

92
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,297
It's Emily here.

93
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:26,635
I know this is out of the blue,
but I'm getting married tomorrow.

94
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,762
Well, maybe I am...

95
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,972
I keep thinking about you.

96
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:35,394
And I'm wondering if we made
a mistake giving up so fast.

97
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,562
Are you thinking about me?

98
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,233
No, of course you're not.
But if you are, call me tonight.

99
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,110
Okay, bye.

100
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,412
Where we going?

101
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,915
This witness won't return my calls.
We'll surprise him coming home.

102
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,752
Surprise him? We're not gonna
make anybody mad, are we?

103
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,838
Come on, man.

104
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:07,342
You gonna squeeze the perp's shoes
a bit before he lawyers up?

105
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,178
He's a witness, not a perp.
And no one talks like that.

106
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,224
Yeah. No one talks like that.

107
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:18,186
- Oh, what, like you're Mr. Cop?
- I'm more cop than you two.

108
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,063
How do you figure that?

109
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,524
I'm in the front seat, okay?

110
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,610
I'm Gary's partner.

111
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,530
When you say "partner,"
it doesn't sound cop.

112
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,740
It sounds gay.

113
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,119
Um, jealous.

114
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,582
- Hey, we're undercover here.
- Oh, yeah. No problem.

115
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,668
- Ross.
- Sorry.

116
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:43,962
There.

117
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,884
Hey, Gary. Who am I?

118
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,760
Phone home.

119
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,225
Look at Officer Ross riding
back here with the visitors.

120
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,104
What's up with that, Serpico?

121
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,819
Are you thinking about me?
No, of course you're not.

122
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,071
But if you are, call me tonight.

123
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,948
Okay, bye.

124
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,744
No.

125
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,663
I know.

126
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,792
Thank God you were here.
We have to erase that.

127
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,878
What? We can't do that.

128
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,172
We have to.
What if Ross hears that...

129
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,508
...and calls her
and they get back together?

130
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,802
Is that what you want?
Ross back with that controlling...

131
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,431
...neurotic, crazy Emily
who wouldn't let him see you?

132
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,725
No. Oh, no, no.

133
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,561
God, no. He should not
get back with her.

134
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:45,315
I know that, you know that.
Even Ross knows that.

135
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,817
But we have no right
to erase his message.

136
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:52,656
Look, I'm his sister and I love him.
I don't want to see him get hurt.

137
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,033
Doesn't that give me
the right to control...

138
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,662
Help him?

139
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,831
He's not the one who needs help.

140
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,669
She's obviously unstable.

141
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,297
She's thinking about running
out on her wedding day.

142
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,846
Okay, fine. But look at
the position she's putting him in.

143
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,974
And what's he gonna do?

144
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:22,269
Break up their marriage
on their wedding day?

145
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,354
Who would do that?

146
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,611
Okay, fine. All right.
But that was different.

147
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,156
Although it did involve
a lot of the same people.

148
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,910
This is some twisted joke
she's playing on him.

149
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,247
You are crazy.
She sounded genuinely upset.

150
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,748
I mean, listen.

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,251
Your messages have been erased.

152
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,462
No.

153
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,594
Okay, but we're safe, right?
Nothing bad's gonna go down.

154
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,138
No. But that reminds me. Sign this.

155
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,472
What is it?

156
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,392
It says you can't sue
if you scrape your knee...

157
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,227
...or get your head blown off.

158
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,732
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.

159
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,817
Here he comes.

160
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,654
What is he doing?
What the hell is he doing?

161
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:15,905
What is it?

162
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,532
- Is everything okay?
- What?

163
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:21,077
He sees us. Don't move.
And don't look at him.

164
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,346
Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire.

165
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,183
Hey, look at that.
You tried to save your buddy.

166
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,560
You see that?

167
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,520
You see what he did?

168
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,606
You okay, man?

169
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,317
Uh-huh.

170
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,527
Thanks, Joey.

171
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,823
Uh... Hello?

172
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,494
Hi.

173
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,085
We should go.

174
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,252
No, wait.

175
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,545
Oh, yeah. Right.

176
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,881
No. Monica.

177
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,300
Monica, we have to fix this.

178
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,678
What can we do?
You erased the message.

179
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,429
Unless we tell him.

180
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,016
If you want to be rational,
I can't argue with you.

181
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,726
All right?

182
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,397
Fine, tell him. I just don't
want to be a part of it.

183
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,485
Maybe that's Emily leaving
the exact same message.

184
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,947
Hey, Ross, it's you.

185
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,199
I just want you
to remember this feeling.

186
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,452
You are lucky to be alive.

187
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,914
So live every day to the fullest.

188
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:51,084
Love yourself, okay?

189
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,628
And also get stamps. Bye.

190
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,842
Play that message for Emily,
and this problem goes away.

191
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,135
Right?

192
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,555
Anybody want to meet a hero?

193
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,932
John Glenn is here?

194
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,642
No. Joey.

195
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,145
We had the most incredible night.

196
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,605
- We're in the car...
- Wait. Hold on.

197
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,484
- Hi.
- Hi.

198
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,445
Okay, go ahead.

199
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,032
So we're in the car, and bang.
A shot was fired.

200
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,786
And Joey, with no regard
for his own safety...

201
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,080
...throws himself on me.

202
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,373
My God.

203
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,126
It was a car backfire.

204
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,836
But he didn't know that.

205
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,713
Yeah, I didn't know that.

206
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,676
It could just as easily
have been a bullet.

207
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,929
Ever think about joining the force?
We could use a guy like you.

208
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,223
Who jumps at loud noises.

209
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,228
Wow. I could have died tonight.

210
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,315
If the car that backfired
had run over you.

211
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,820
I'm going before he starts rambling
about his newfound respect for life.

212
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:04,741
I do have a newfound respect for life.

213
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,786
Oh, my God.

214
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,500
- You want to get some dinner?
- Yeah, sure.

215
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:18,505
You know what? If I heard a shot
right now, I'd throw my body on you.

216
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,341
Maybe we should walk
in a bad neighborhood.

217
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,884
Okay.

218
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,805
- Bye.
- Bye.

219
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,477
Cut it out.

220
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:36,439
I'd hate to save your life
and kick your ass on the same day.

221
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,491
Dude.

222
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,159
Why'd you take off?

223
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,620
Just going for a walk.

224
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,331
Around the living room, whatever.

225
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,919
- Is something wrong?
- No. No, I'm just tired.

226
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,421
You know, from the walk.

227
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,715
Okay.

228
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,009
You dove in front of Ross.

229
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,345
Ross.

230
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,973
That's what this is about.

231
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,811
Oh, my God. You hate Ross.

232
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,188
I don't hate Ross.

233
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:21,192
Of course you do. I saved him.
You're mad at me. It adds up.

234
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,987
You want Ross out of the picture.

235
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,738
What picture?

236
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,575
I don't know.
But I don't like what I'm hearing.

237
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,745
I'm glad you saved Ross.
But it could've been a bullet.

238
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,206
And you didn't try to save me.

239
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,041
Oh.

240
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,461
You're upset because you think
I chose Ross over you.

241
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:45,174
No, I knew you could
take care of yourself.

242
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:49,304
You know? I mean, Ross needs help.
He's not "street" like us.

243
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,141
You'd risk your life for Ross
before you would for me.

244
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,018
That's the bottom line.

245
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,979
No, not exactly.

246
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,814
All right, look.

247
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,026
I wasn't trying to save Ross.

248
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,069
Okay?

249
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,823
My sandwich was next to Ross.

250
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,243
All right?

251
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,331
I was trying to save my sandwich.

252
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,959
From a bullet?

253
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,172
- I know it doesn't make much sense.
- "Much" sense?

254
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,675
Chandler, it was instinct.
I just went for it.

255
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,345
You risked your life for a sandwich?

256
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,597
I know it sounds crazy...

257
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:37,310
...but this is the greatest
sandwich in the world.

258
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,190
So you didn't choose Ross before me?

259
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,901
No. I would never do that.

260
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,028
You're like my brother.

261
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,989
- Really?
- Yeah.

262
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:54,702
In fact, to prove how much
you mean to me...

263
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,375
Here.

264
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,128
- Thanks.
- Easy, it's not a hot dog.

265
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,095
How good is that?

266
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,055
Oh, yeah.

267
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,182
See?

268
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,642
What are you doing?

269
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,604
You're showing me how much
I mean to you.

270
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,189
With a bite.

271
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,441
Jeez.

272
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,001
Hi.

273
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,503
What are you doing here?

274
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,005
Hey, you know what?

275
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,549
You are in our apartment
all the time.

276
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,260
This is just a drop
in the bucket, mister.

277
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:58,307
It doesn't matter. The important thing
is that you're here.

278
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,103
You're my friend and you're here.

279
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,194
Okay, just a little scared.
What's going on?

280
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,905
The most amazing thing
happened tonight.

281
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,450
I thought my number was up.

282
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,578
I had an actual near-death experience.

283
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,038
What happened?

284
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:24,709
We were on the ride-along with Gary
and somebody took a shot at me.

285
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,130
Really?

286
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,466
No. A car backfired.

287
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:37,930
But I thought somebody was taking
a shot at me. And, Rach...

288
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,640
...I survived.

289
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:45,480
And I was filled with
this great respect for life.

290
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,982
I want to experience every moment.

291
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,486
I want to seize every opportunity.

292
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:55,364
I am seeing everything so clearly now.

293
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,742
Because a car backfired?

294
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,453
Okay. Why are you here?

295
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:06,334
I don't know how this fits
into your whole seizing thing...

296
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,169
...but Emily called you today.

297
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,714
- You talked to her?
- She left a message.

298
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,841
But it kind of got erased.

299
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,595
I mean, there's something
wrong with your machine.

300
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,222
What did she say?

301
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,810
Something about having second
thoughts about the wedding.

302
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,063
And did you guys make
a mistake breaking up?

303
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,732
And she wants you to call her.

304
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,651
Wow.

305
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,029
That was a good thing
that I told you, right?

306
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,698
Yeah. Yes. Of course.

307
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,952
Okay, thank you. Thank you. Because...

308
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,621
I'm gonna tell Monica I was right.

309
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,540
Because she didn't want...

310
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:50,294
Not important. Point is,
I was right. Your decision.

311
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,462
Okay?

312
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,922
I was right.

313
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,924
Your decision.

314
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,634
Right.

315
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,095
I guess I should call Emily.

316
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,597
No, that's not the right decision.

317
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,307
That's not right.

318
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,809
Ross, come on.

319
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,644
I mean...

320
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,896
...that woman made you miserable.

321
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,648
Okay, Ross?

322
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,401
Do you really want
to get back into that?

323
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,821
Okay, look. Yesterday...

324
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:20,199
...I wouldn't have even
considered calling her back.

325
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,910
But my ex-wife calls
on the same day...

326
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,580
...I have a near-death experience?

327
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,832
That's gotta mean something.

328
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:32,962
That was not a near-death experience.
That was barely an experience.

329
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,339
You weren't there.

330
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,845
Maybe this is something that
I'm supposed to seize, you know?

331
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,056
Okay. You know what?

332
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:48,102
Maybe this is not about seizing stuff.

333
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,898
Maybe this is about escaping stuff.

334
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,941
Okay? Look at today.

335
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,735
I mean, you escaped...

336
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,445
...death.

337
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,867
And maybe this is a chance
for you to escape...

338
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,036
...getting back together with Emily.

339
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,997
That does make sense.

340
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:13,544
Because I do want to seize
some opportunity...

341
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:17,381
...but I really don't want
to see or talk to her.

342
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,677
Well, there you go.

343
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,180
Yeah, maybe today's just...

344
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,183
...close-call day.

345
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,395
Hey, thanks, Rach.

346
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,272
Oh, honey. No problem.

347
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,984
Wait, wait. The message is blinking.

348
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,111
Maybe you didn't erase it.

349
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,822
Hey, Ross, it's you...

350
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:46,619
That's an old message.
Nobody needs to hear that.

351
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,081
Hey, um, was Monica here?

352
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,540
Yeah.

353
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,542
I want my money back.

354
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,046
You probably need that
for stamps, right?

355
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,055
Hey, Pheebs?

356
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,015
Has Gary ever been shot at for real?

357
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,350
Yes, once.

358
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,602
A little.

359
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,063
He kind of did it to himself.

360
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,774
It's not really a good story.

361
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:21,112
I wonder how I'd react under fire.
And not backfire...

362
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,863
...but heavy fire.

363
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,116
Like if I was in a war.

364
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,243
Man, I would be great in a war.

365
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,454
I think I'd make
a fantastic military leader.

366
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:34,292
I mean, I know I'd make general
before any of you guys.

367
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,045
Before or after you were shot
by your own troops?

368
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:42,341
I know Joey would be in the foxhole
protecting all of us.

369
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:45,344
If the foxhole was
lined with sandwiches.

370
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,848
Yeah, hero sandwiches.

371
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,813
You all know I'm a pacifist,
so I'm not interested in war in any way.

372
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:59,358
But when the revolution comes,
I'll have to destroy you all.

373
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,861
Not you, Joey.
