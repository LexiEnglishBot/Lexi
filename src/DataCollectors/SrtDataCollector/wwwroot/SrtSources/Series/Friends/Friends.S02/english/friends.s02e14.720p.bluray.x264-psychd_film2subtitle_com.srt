1
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,128
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:05,754
Hold on a second.

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,468
Nice. Nice.

4
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,095
I got you something.

5
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,181
- What's this?
- Eight hundred and twelve bucks.

6
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:19,268
I don't know what Big Leon told you,
but it's a thousand...

7
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,395
...if you want me for the whole night.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,690
- What is this for?
- Well, I'm making money now.

9
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,985
And this is paying you back
for headshots, electric bills...

10
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,487
...and so many slices of pizza
I can't even count.

11
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:33,615
- I love you, man.
- Well, thanks, man.

12
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,075
Now I can get my pony.

13
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:40,873
Hey. This is a little extra something
for always being there for me.

14
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:51,884
Wow, I don't know what to say.

15
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,804
- Eh? What do you say?
- I don't know.

16
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,724
It's a bracelet.

17
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:02,061
Isn't it? It's engraved too. Check it out.

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,229
"To my best bud. "

19
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,569
Thanks, best bud.

20
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,323
- Put it on.
- Oh. Now?

21
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,411
No, something this nice should be saved
for a special occasion.

22
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,581
No, that's the beauty part.
It goes with everything.

23
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,751
When you put this on,
you're good to go.

24
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,299
Oh, man!

25
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:35,427
You are so wearing that bracelet!

26
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,971
I so am!

27
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,725
Oh! Any idea what this will
do for your sex life?

28
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,811
It'll probably slow it down at first...

29
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:47,106
...but once I'm used to the extra weight,
I'll be back on track.

30
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,490
- This all looks good.
- Great.

31
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,827
If I want to call for a reference
on your last job?

32
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:45,205
Oh, that's there on the bottom, see?
The manager, Chandler Bing?

33
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,748
All right.

34
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:51,003
Let's see if you're as good in person
as you are on paper. Make me a salad.

35
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,506
A salad? I could do
something more complicated.

36
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,509
No, just the salad will be fine.

37
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,428
You got it.

38
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:04,266
Now I want you to tell me
what you're doing while you're doing it.

39
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,395
All right. Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.

40
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,063
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?

41
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,732
Oh, no, no. I'm gonna wash it.

42
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,193
Don't. I like it dirty.

43
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,405
That's your call.

44
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,742
So, uh, what are you going to do next?

45
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,494
I thought that I'd
cut up the tomatoes.

46
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,997
Are they firm?

47
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,294
- They're okay.
- You sure they haven't gone bad?

48
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:35,172
You sure they're not very, very bad?

49
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,469
Ahem. No, really, they're okay.

50
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,971
You gonna slice them up real nice?

51
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,098
I was going to do them julienne.

52
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,228
I'm out of here!

53
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,238
Hello?

54
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,366
Rachel's not here right now.
Can I take a message?

55
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,493
All right. And how do we spell Casey?

56
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,454
Is it like "at the bat"
or "and The Sunshine Band"?

57
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,040
Okay, bye-bye.

58
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,794
Hey, who's this Casey?

59
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,629
Some guy she met at the movies.

60
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,589
What does he want with her?

61
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,967
I'm guessing he wants to
do a little dance...

62
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,263
...you know, make a little love...

63
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,518
Well, pretty much get down tonight.

64
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,400
I don't know. I don't...

65
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:40,237
I don't get it! Two months ago,
Rachel and I were this close.

66
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,865
Now I'm taking messages from guys
she meets at the movies?

67
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:48,036
I mean, this Casey should be
taking down my messages, you know?

68
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,248
Or Rachel and I should be together...

69
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,501
...and we should get
some kind of message service.

70
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,087
Hang in there.
It's gonna happen.

71
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,755
Now how do you know that?

72
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,758
Because she's your lobster.

73
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,512
Oh, she's going somewhere.

74
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:12,185
It's a known fact that lobsters
fall in love and mate for life.

75
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:16,523
You know what? You can actually
see old lobster couples...

76
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,485
...walking around their tank,
holding claws, like...

77
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,158
Hey, you feeling better?

78
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,745
Yeah, I think that fifth shower
actually got the interview off me.

79
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,497
So do you have any other possibilities?

80
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,959
Yeah. There is the possibility
that I won't make rent.

81
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,128
Monica, if you want,
I can lend you money.

82
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,131
No, no. If I couldn't pay you
back right away...

83
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,800
...then I'd feel guilty and tense
every time I saw you.

84
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:47,012
Oh. Then why don't you borrow it
from Mom and Dad?

85
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,015
You feel guilty and tense
around them already.

86
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,809
Might as well
make some money off of them.

87
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,437
- The man's got a point.
- Ohh.

88
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,565
What is that sparkly thing?

89
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,193
That thing? It's a, uh...

90
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,655
Yeah, it's a little flashy.

91
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,908
No, no.

92
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,620
No, no. It's not flashy.
Not for a goodfella.

93
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:18,668
Man, that is sharp! That must
have cost you quite a few doubloons.

94
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,549
Hi.
- Hi.

95
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,676
- Hi, darling.
So what's this?

96
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,345
Some of your old stuff.

97
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:34,184
Well, sweetie, we have a surprise for you.
We're turning your room into a gym.

98
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,397
Wow, that is a surprise!

99
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,066
Just one little question.
Why not Ross' room?

100
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,692
Gosh, we talked about that...

101
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:47,572
...but your brother had so many science
trophies, plaques, merit badges...

102
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,699
Well, we didn't want to disturb them.

103
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,326
God forbid!

104
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,914
- Ohh.
- Hi.

105
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,874
Hi, Rachel. Aww.

106
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:01,420
We were so sorry to hear
about your parents splitting up.

107
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:05,382
Well, they're just separated.
You never know! We'll see.

108
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,801
I can't say any of us were surprised.

109
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,472
Your parents have been unhappy
ever since we've known them.

110
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,892
- Oh.
- Especially after that incident in Hawaii.

111
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,813
What? What incident?

112
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:23,233
Um, no, no.
I must be thinking of someone else.

113
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,068
Maybe me! Ha!

114
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,239
Don't you have some folding to do?
Go fold, dear. Fold. You fold.

115
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,912
Want a refill?
- No. I'm all right, thanks.

116
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,543
You gotta give me a second.
I want to get this just right.

117
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,503
Ahem.

118
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,509
Dude, 11:00,
totally hot babe checking you out.

119
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:56,141
That was really good.
I think I'm ready for my penis now.

120
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,194
I know what you're thinking.
Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.

121
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,822
- I'm Gail.
- Chandler.

122
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:16,703
I... I really have to be somewhere,
but it was nice meeting you.

123
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,039
What?

124
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,296
This is excellent!

125
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,174
He could've gotten me a VCR
or a set of golf clubs.

126
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,468
But no! He has to get me
the "woman repeller"!

127
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,597
The eyesore from
the Liberace House of Crap!

128
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,683
- It's not that bad.
- Easy for you to say.

129
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,020
You're not sporting a reject
from the Mr. T collection!

130
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,438
Chandler. Chandler.

131
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:47,192
"I pity the fool that puts on
my jewelry! I do! I do!

132
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,402
I pity that fool... " Ay.

133
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,366
Hey, man!
We were just doing some impressions.

134
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,992
Do your Marcel Marceau.

135
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,788
That's actually good.

136
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:12,509
Would you look at that guy?
How long has he been talking to her?

137
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:16,846
It's like, back off, buddy!
She's a waitress, not a geisha.

138
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,224
I think she's okay.

139
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,187
Look at that! See how she's
pushing him away and he won't budge?

140
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,273
I'm gonna do something.

141
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:32,571
We'll get a condo right on the mountain.
Ski in, ski out, it's great.

142
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,532
Excuse me? Are you Rachel?

143
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,075
What?

144
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,369
Ross Geller.

145
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,373
God, in your ad you said
you were pretty, but wow!

146
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,418
What are you doing?

147
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,462
Oh, my God, is this the wrong day?

148
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,090
I don't believe it!

149
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,135
If it works out, we'll have something
to tell the grandkids!

150
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,678
You sure will.

151
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,638
I've gotta go.

152
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,640
- Take care.
Okay.

153
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,058
- See you later.
Ohh.

154
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,980
You're welcome.

155
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,067
- What?
- I was saving you.

156
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,988
Saving me from the pleasant conversation
with the interesting man?

157
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,074
- From where I was...
- Okay, Ross, listen to me.

158
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,952
I am not yours to save.

159
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,872
- But you are.
- What?

160
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,583
Uh, well, um... You're my lobster.

161
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,340
Okay. Are you being
the blind-date guy again?

162
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,385
No, you're my lobster.

163
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,055
See, um... Lobsters...

164
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,600
Uh, in the tank, when they're old...

165
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,605
...they get with the...
They walk around holding the claws.

166
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,025
In the tank!
You know, with...

167
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,944
...with the holding and...

168
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,031
Pheebs, you wanna help me
with the lobster thing?

169
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,075
Do the claws again.

170
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,287
Rach, forget the lobsters, okay?

171
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,289
Let's talk... What about us?

172
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,751
Ross, there is no "us," okay?

173
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,379
- No, but...
- No! Listen to me!

174
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,881
I fell for you and I get clobbered.

175
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,009
You then fall for me
and I again get clobbered.

176
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,846
I'm tired of being clobbered,
you know?

177
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,640
It's just not worth it.

178
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,100
Well, but...

179
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,227
No "but," Ross.

180
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:31,314
We are never gonna happen, okay?
Accept that.

181
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,526
Except... Except that what?

182
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,114
No. No.

183
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:43,034
Accept that.

184
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,497
Oh.

185
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:56,214
Hey, man! Look, it's my best bud!
How you doing?

186
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,760
Wow. You're getting good at that
Marcel Marceau thing.

187
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,015
What do you say we play some ball?
You and me, huh? What do you say?

188
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,520
Okay, that's my bad.

189
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,316
If you hated the bracelet,
you should have just said so.

190
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,569
Doesn't the fact that I wore it...

191
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,655
...say how much
our friendship means to me?

192
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,784
What about the fact that you insulted
the bracelet and you made fun of me?

193
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,037
Well, that's the part
where I'm a wank.

194
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,166
I was hoping you
wouldn't focus on that.

195
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,170
Come on, man!
I said I was sorry a hundred times.

196
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,839
I promise, I will never
take it off my...

197
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,841
...wrist.

198
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,889
But if you want to stay in there
and be mad...

199
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,057
...you just, you stay in there.

200
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,934
You know what the...

201
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,187
I am here, on my knees...

202
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,816
...holding up these couch cushions...

203
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,736
...as a symbol
of my sorrow and regret.

204
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,157
Much like they did
in biblical times.

205
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,242
Though you may haveth anger now...

206
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,168
You know, that Steffi Graf
has quite a tush.

207
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,630
I'm just saying! It's right there!

208
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,966
- Hey, guys.
Hi, darling.

209
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,385
Where's my grandson?
You didn't bring him?

210
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,472
No. He's at Carol and Susan's today.

211
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,974
A woman in my office is a lesbian.

212
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,144
I'm just saying!

213
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,732
Jack, look! There's that house
paint commercial that cracks you up!

214
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,782
- Where have you been?
- Emotional hell.

215
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,575
So did they lend you the money?

216
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,619
No, I haven't asked them yet.

217
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,454
Come on, Monica, do it.

218
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,122
Hey, you guys.

219
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,416
Monica has some news.

220
00:13:56,752 --> 00:14:00,922
So listen, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you this before, but...

221
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,718
...I'm no longer at my job.
I had to leave it.

222
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,180
- Why?
- Because they made me.

223
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:14,310
You were fired?
What are you gonna do?

224
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,815
Judy, relax. This is our little Harmonica
we're talking about.

225
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,275
We taught her well.

226
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:24,654
- Ten percent of your paycheck goes where?
In the bank.

227
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,408
So she dips into her savings.
That's what it's there for.

228
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,993
She's gonna be fine.

229
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,036
If you need a little extra...

230
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,414
...you know where to find it.

231
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,708
Anything larger back there?

232
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,086
I can't believe it!

233
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,880
Would you stop already?

234
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,091
Get out of the bitter barn
and play in the hay.

235
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,802
Oh, you're right.
I should play in the hay.

236
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:52,307
For about the fact I just dropped $400
to replace a bracelet I hated to begin with.

237
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,225
Bring on the hay!

238
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,227
Hey!

239
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,648
I've got something
that'll make you happy.

240
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,567
Guess what Gunther found?

241
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,652
Ohh!

242
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,696
Hey, now you have two!

243
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,199
Oh, now you have two.

244
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,871
What am I gonna do?

245
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:19,500
Hey.

246
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,378
How come you have two?

247
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,256
This one's for you.

248
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,052
- Get out!
- No, I can't.

249
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,681
I know how much this means to you...

250
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,184
...and I also know this is
about more than jewelry.

251
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:39,938
It's about you and me
and the fact that we're "best buds. "

252
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,984
Wow. Is this friendship? I think so!

253
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,113
Check it out!
We're bracelet buddies!

254
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,783
That's what they'll call us!

255
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,996
Okay, here you go.
Pay me back whenever you like.

256
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,332
You have dinosaur checks?

257
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,920
Yeah. You get your money
and you learn something.

258
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,380
What's wrong with that?

259
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,798
Nothing.

260
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,717
Hey, you're a cheap-a-saurus!

261
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:15,223
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Thank you, I'm very grateful.

262
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,891
Hey, Mon, what is this?

263
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,185
Oh, um...

264
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:23,356
That's my bathing suit from high school.
I was a little bigger then.

265
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:28,069
Oh, I thought that's what they used
to cover Connecticut when it rains.

266
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,447
Hey, what's on this videotape?

267
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,324
You got me. Let's put it in.

268
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,998
- Hi.
- Hey.

269
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,628
Over here, Jack. Okay.

270
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,964
Rachel's coming up the path.

271
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,341
Doesn't she look pretty? Jack?

272
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,718
Can you get this?

273
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,222
Oh, my God!

274
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,433
What is with your nose?

275
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:04,897
They had to reduce it
because of my deviated septum.

276
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:09,152
Okay, I was wrong. That's
what they use to cover Connecticut.

277
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,156
- This is us getting ready for the prom.
- Ah!

278
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,117
- We don't have to watch.
- Yeah, we do.

279
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,744
Come on!
It's fun!

280
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,370
Get a shot of Monica.

281
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,081
- Where's Monica?
Over here, Dad!

282
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,209
Wait. How do you zoom out?

283
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,963
There she is!

284
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,177
Some girl ate Monica!

285
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,390
Shut up!
The camera adds ten pounds.

286
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,226
So how many cameras
are actually on you?

287
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,356
Oh, you look so great!

288
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,318
So do you! You look beautiful!

289
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,445
Oops.
What?

290
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,280
I think I got mayonnaise on you.

291
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,033
Oh, it's just the shoulder,
not my dress.

292
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,162
Everybody smile!

293
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,414
Oh, Dad, turn it off!

294
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,959
It is off.
- It is not! What's with the red light?

295
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,463
It's the off light. Right, Ross?

296
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,598
Looking good, Mr. Kotter.

297
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,563
- You look pretty tonight.
- Oh, thanks.

298
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,861
- What are you doing this summer?
- I'm gonna hang out...

299
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,114
...work on my music.

300
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,995
Is my hook unhooked?
These things keep falling down.

301
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,755
Let me see. I don't know.
What are you gonna do...

302
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,716
Oh! The guys are here!

303
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,135
- This summer?

304
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,427
Work on your music?

305
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,269
Oh, my God! There's Roy Gublik!

306
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:10,690
You know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times.

307
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,191
His name was in the paper.

308
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,988
Where's Chip?
Why isn't he here yet?

309
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,907
He'll be here, okay? Take a chill pill.

310
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,827
There.

311
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,960
I just told Rachel
that Roy touched my boob.

312
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:37,425
I can't go to the prom without a date.
I can't! It's too late!

313
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,595
If you're not going,
then I don't want to go either.

314
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,347
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass!

315
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,185
I have a wonderful idea.

316
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,146
You should take Rachel to the prom.

317
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:55,318
- Doubtful.
- Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.

318
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,113
All right, go on. This thing's heavy.

319
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,909
Your mother's right. Take her.
You can wear my tux.

320
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,577
She won't wanna go with me.

321
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,705
Of course she would!
You're a college man!

322
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,208
- I don't know.
- Well, come on.

323
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,251
Don't you wanna find out?

324
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,963
I can't believe I can't go to the prom!

325
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,715
This is so harsh!

326
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,348
- Hold my board.
- Attaboy! Attaboy!

327
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,433
I think we've seen enough.

328
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,477
- Let's turn it off.
- No, no, no!

329
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,646
Well, I'm not gonna watch.

330
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,357
Come on, kid. Let's go!

331
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,238
My! Are you handsome!
Let's show them!

332
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,156
Just a sec, Dad.

333
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,618
Okay, be cool. Just be cool.

334
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,420
Okay, Dad.

335
00:20:56,588 --> 00:21:00,424
Rachel, ready or not,
here comes your knight in shining...

336
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,884
Oh, no.

337
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,053
Bye! Don't wait up!

338
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,013
Chip!

339
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,558
Oh, dear!

340
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,435
Jack. How do I turn this off?

341
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:12,979
Press the button.

342
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,106
Which one? Which button? Jack!

343
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,899
The button! The button!

344
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,114
I can't believe you did that.

345
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,119
Yeah, well...

346
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,733
See? He's her lobster!

347
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,826
Dance with him!

348
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,494
Mom, I'm hungry!

349
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,705
Dance with your father.

350
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:17,209
I don't know any of your flashdances,
but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.

351
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,170
All right.

352
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,511
Oh, Jack!
Oh, Judy!

353
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,100
Oh, Judy!
