1
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:07,089
- Are you excited about our honeymoon?
- Yeah, I am.

2
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:10,384
[SINGING] Bermuda, Bahama
Come on, pretty mama

3
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:14,138
Get it out of your system
while we're alone.

4
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:18,267
- We came to say goodbye.
- Have a great honeymoon.

5
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,269
- Thanks.
- I'll go pack.

6
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:24,940
I already packed. The only thing
I couldn't find, though, was your Speedo.

7
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:31,113
Speedo? Uh, I don't have a Speedo.

8
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:35,826
I'm gonna go pack
my regular, long bathing suit.

9
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:40,873
Good, you're still here. I wanted
to tell you to have a good honeymoon.

10
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,958
Oh, thank you.

11
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:47,463
And I wanted you guys to know
that I am telling the father today.

12
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,385
What? What? What?

13
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:58,432
- We know it's Ross.
- How? How do you know?

14
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,643
It was his sweater. But, oh, my God!

15
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:06,106
I so wanted Ross to know first.
But I'm so relieved that you guys know.

16
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:10,152
- That's so great. I'll be your baby's aunt!
- I know.

17
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:15,282
- Me too!
- I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here.

18
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:20,120
- You'll all be aunts and uncles.
- But I'm the only one related by blood.

19
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:27,127
Okay, great. Now that you all know,
you can give me advice on how to tell Ross.

20
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,879
What were you gonna say?

21
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:33,383
That I'm gonna have the baby,
and he can be as involved as he wants.

22
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,260
Well, that sounds good.

23
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,139
Yeah, but how do I start?
What's the first thing that I say?

24
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,939
- Okay, great. Thanks.
- Hey, good luck.

25
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,483
PHOEBE:
Yeah, bye.

26
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,193
What was that all about?

27
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:56,156
Well, I guess no harm in telling you now.
Rachel and Ross are having a baby.

28
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:02,412
[IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] What? I didn't
even know! Why didn't you tell me?

29
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,666
Why am I talking like this?

30
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,252
I didn't think
you could keep it a secret.

31
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:13,715
[IN NORMAL VOICE] What? I'm an excellent
secret-keeper. I've kept all our secrets.

32
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,677
- What secrets?
- No, no, Joey.

33
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:21,723
I'm not gonna tell you because
I am an excellent secret-keeper.

34
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,354
- Psst. You'll tell me later?
- You already know.

35
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:14,610
It's so romantic to send people off
on their honeymoon.

36
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,780
You know, Monica and Chandler are married.
Ross and Rachel are having a baby.

37
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:25,120
- Maybe you and I should do something.
- All in good time, my love. All in good time.

38
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:31,001
Oh, shoot. I left my guitar in their apartment.
You can let me in later, right?

39
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,670
No, I don't have a key.
They took mine to give to you.

40
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,884
- What? They took mine to give to you.
- Why would they take away our keys?

41
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,594
Maybe they don't trust us.

42
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,680
They let me keep my key
the last time they were out of town.

43
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,183
You mean the time
you broke the ketchup bottle...

44
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,102
...and cleaned it up
with Monica's guest towels?

45
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,855
- I washed those.
- No, you didn't.

46
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,566
Yeah, that didn't sound like me.

47
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:59,488
- What am I gonna do? I really need my guitar.
- I have stuff in there too.

48
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:04,201
- What stuff?
- Monica's chicken parm. I'll take care of this.

49
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,121
Mr. Treeger? It's Joey Tribbiani.

50
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:12,459
I need to get into Monica
and Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency.

51
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:17,464
Uh... Uh... Gas leak.
Oh, and bring garlic bread.

52
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,717
- Hey.
- Hey.

53
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,595
- Did Rachel find you?
- No, why?

54
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:28,934
- She was looking for you.
- Well, I guess I'll catch up with her later.

55
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:34,523
- She really wanted to talk to you now.
- Yeah, it seemed pretty important.

56
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:40,195
- Oh, no.
PHOEBE: What?

57
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,864
I think I might know
what this is about.

58
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,077
Really?

59
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:52,666
Yeah. We promised we weren't
gonna tell anybody this...

60
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,713
...but a month ago,
Rachel and I slept together.

61
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,340
And?

62
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:09,808
- Wow, I thought you'd be more shocked.
- Oh, sorry. And?

63
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:18,150
Well, we said we'd just
do it that one time...

64
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:22,112
...but now I think she may
wanna start things up again.

65
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,032
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.

66
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:31,288
- Why? What else could it be?
- Oh, wow, I don't feel well.

67
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,668
I'm telling you, I'm telling you,
that's what it is.

68
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:40,672
No wonder she was looking
at me all funny during the wedding.

69
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,425
She didn't say anything to you?

70
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,678
- Maybe it's something you ate.
- It could've been...

71
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:51,516
- Please, just go and talk to Rachel.
- Yeah, I guess I should.

72
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,854
Man, you know what I have to realize?

73
00:05:56,064 --> 00:06:00,067
Maybe I'm not the type of guy
women can have just one night with.

74
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:07,157
They always seem to want
a little bit more.

75
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,702
I should remember that.

76
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,963
CLERK:
Next.

77
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:26,051
- They're kissing. Let's go around them.
- Leave them alone. They're in love.

78
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,638
I'm in love too.
But in an orderly fashion.

79
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,933
- Next.
- Hi. Can you do that and walk?

80
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,143
Because she said, "Next."

81
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:40,232
Sorry, we didn't hear you.
We're on our honeymoon.

82
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:46,488
Aw. Let me see what I can do.
There are some first-class seats available.

83
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:50,283
They bumped them up to first class
because they're on their honeymoon.

84
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,452
Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.

85
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,122
We are on our honeymoon.

86
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:59,167
- Grab my ass.
- Next.

87
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:04,756
Sorry, I almost didn't hear you because
I'm so in love with my new husband.

88
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,926
- We're on our honeymoon.
- Congratulations.

89
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:13,265
Mr. Bing, you'll be in 25J,
and Mrs. Bing, you're in 25K.

90
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:18,103
We're on our honeymoon, so can you do
your little thing, bump us up to first class?

91
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,982
I'm sorry, all the first-class seats are taken.
That couple got the last two.

92
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:27,946
If we'd gone around them like I said,
she'd have given us those tickets. Damn it.

93
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:32,451
25J and K, any chance
those aren't together?

94
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,955
I still can't believe they took away my key.
You trust me with yours.

95
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,125
Of course I do.
And I'll give it back to you...

96
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,628
...as soon as they're done with it
at the key-shining place.

97
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,798
[LOUD BANGING]

98
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,676
What the hell is that?

99
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:54,389
- Whoa, whoa. Treeger, what are you doing?
- You said there was a gas leak in here.

100
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:59,478
- Why don't you use your key?
- I won't find it before the place explodes.

101
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,523
If that happens at another building
I manage, people will start asking questions.

102
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,317
Come on, hurry up.

103
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,985
Oh!

104
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,031
We could have done that.

105
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,536
Look at that. They're going into
the first-class lounge.

106
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,955
- Do you know what they have in there?
- No.

107
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,750
Me neither. We have to get in!

108
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,254
- Just act like you belong.
- Oh, my God! Oranges!

109
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,923
Shh!

110
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:34,179
- Nice to see you again.
- Sir, may I see your tickets, please?

111
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,056
Yes, of course.

112
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,768
Would you move your thumb.
I can't see the seat number.

113
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:43,813
That's all right.
I have it memorized. It's 1A.

114
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:49,653
- Sir, this isn't a first-class ticket. I'm sorry.
- Apology accepted. Excuse us.

115
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:54,616
Sir, I'm afraid I'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

116
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,826
Fine.

117
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,996
Go, go, go!

118
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,386
- Hi.
- Hi.

119
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,762
Hi.

120
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:20,141
I think there's something that
we really need to talk about.

121
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,980
I think we do.
Why don't we go inside.

122
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,485
- Hi.
- Hi.

123
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:35,323
- Look, I know why you're here.
- You do?

124
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:41,621
Yeah, and to save you from any
embarrassment, I think I should talk first.

125
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,707
- Okay.
- Okay.

126
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,292
Here.

127
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:58,847
Ross and Rachel.
Rachel and Ross. Heh.

128
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,852
It's been one heck of a seesaw,
hasn't it?

129
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,895
What?

130
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:12,819
I mean, look, that one night we had
was fun and certainly passionate.

131
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,781
But don't you think it's better
if we just stay friends?

132
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,827
Seriously, what?

133
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,582
Okay, okay. You know what?

134
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,711
If you want to,
we can do it one more time.

135
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:38,094
I'd be okay with that.
In fact, I have some time right now.

136
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:42,641
- You know what? Ahem. Can I talk now?
- Oh, sure.

137
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,982
I'm pregnant.

138
00:10:55,071 --> 00:11:03,078
Ross?

139
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,665
Okay, whenever you're ready.

140
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:17,258
And you're the father, by the way.
But you're good.

141
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:33,483
- Can I get you some water?
- I'm good, I'm good.

142
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:40,115
Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay?
You can be as involved as you want.

143
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:49,916
Yeah, I, uh... I'm just, I don't know.
I don't understand...

144
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,878
...how this happened.

145
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,300
- We used a condom.
- I know.

146
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:04,556
But you know, condoms only work,
like, 97 percent of the time.

147
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,016
What? What?

148
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,979
What?

149
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:15,650
Well, they should put that on the box!

150
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,572
- They do.
- No, they don't!

151
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,749
Well, they should put it
in huge block letters!

152
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:36,588
- Let's just forget about the condoms.
- Well, I may as well have!

153
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:44,804
- Listen, I was really freaked out too when...
- Freaked out? No, I'm not freaked out.

154
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,475
I'm indignant as a consumer!

155
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,688
- You know what? Let's talk later.
- No. No, I wanna talk now.

156
00:12:53,898 --> 00:13:00,737
In fact, I wanna talk to
the president of the condom company.

157
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,157
- Okay, maybe I should come back...
- Shh!

158
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,494
Yeah, I'll press one!

159
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:16,669
- I looked everywhere. There's no gas leak.
- So now I can heat this up?

160
