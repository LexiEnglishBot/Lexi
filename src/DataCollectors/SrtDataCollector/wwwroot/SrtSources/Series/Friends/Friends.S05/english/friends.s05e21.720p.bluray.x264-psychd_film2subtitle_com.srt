1
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:04,920
I'm gonna get more coffee,
do you want anything, baby doll?

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,463
I'm fine. Thanks.

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,966
See, I can't pull off "baby doll," can I?

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:12,678
No, I think we learned that
from the "sugar lips" incident.

5
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,305
- I'm gonna get some tea.
- Okay.

6
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:17,057
How you doing, pumpkin?

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,726
Nope.

8
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,396
- So it looks like it's going well for you two.
- I know. Really well.

9
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,232
In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe
to move in with me.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,484
- Oh, my God.
- What do you think?

11
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,737
I think that it's great.
When are you gonna ask her?

12
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:33,449
- Tonight. But don't say anything, okay?
- I swear. I promise. I promise.

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,992
My God, I'm so excited.

14
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,494
But listen, do not get her flowers, okay?

15
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:41,290
Because she cries when they die,
then there's the whole funeral.

16
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,879
- I'll see you after work, sweetie.
- Okay. Bye.

17
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,591
So, what movie should we see?

18
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,343
Gary's gonna ask you
to move in with him.

19
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:55,846
What? Really?

20
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,390
He told me at the counter.
He made me promise not to tell...

21
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,768
...but I couldn't hold it in any longer.

22
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,061
I can't believe this.

23
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,689
Right? Because it's fast.
Because it's so fast. It's fast.

24
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,568
- Relax. It's Phoebe, not you.
- Oh.

25
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,737
Good for you, Pheebs. Way to go.

26
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,656
- No, but it is fast, isn't it?
- No.

27
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:18,243
- I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready.
- So, what are you gonna do?

28
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:22,331
I don't know. I'll just handle it.
I'll ask you to talk to him.

29
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,083
Me? Why me?

30
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,335
Because you are
so afraid of commitment.

31
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:30,464
You talk to him. Make him scared
like you, make him a man.

32
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,258
I'll try, but I'm not sure
what good it would do...

33
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,470
...because I'm less afraid of commitment
than I used to be.

34
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,806
That is so sweet.

35
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,142
Still terrified.
I'll take care of it no problem.

36
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:41,118
Hey, Ross, is, uh, Staten Island
really an island?

37
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:45,080
Uh-huh. That's why they call it
Staten "Island."

38
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,292
Oh, I thought it was like Long Island.

39
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,215
Also an island.

40
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,052
- Hey, what time is it?
- Two seventeen.

41
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,807
Wow, you realize we've been throwing
this ball without dropping it for an hour?

42
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,475
Are you serious?

43
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,437
Yeah, I realized it a half-hour ago,
but I didn't wanna say anything...

44
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,856
...because I didn't wanna jinx it.

45
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,025
Wow, we are pretty good at this.

46
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,653
Hey, we totally forgot about lunch.

47
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,908
I think that's the first time
I've ever missed a meal.

48
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,243
I think my pants are a little loose.

49
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,875
Hey, you guys. Uh, is Monica here?

50
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,251
- No.
- No.

51
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,046
Listen, um, I bought something.
I'm not sure she's gonna like it.

52
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,505
And it's gonna seem crazy...

53
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,175
...but this is something I've wanted
since I was a little girl.

54
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,344
You bought Shaun Cassidy.

55
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,554
No. I wish.

56
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,139
Okay, you ready?

57
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,349
Yeah.

58
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,103
Check it out.

59
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,278
- Oh, my God. What is it?
- What the hell is that?

60
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,532
- It's a cat.
- That is not a cat.

61
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,118
Yes, it is.

62
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,621
Why is it inside out?

63
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:17,381
Excuse me, but this is a purebred,
show-quality sphinx cat.

64
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,092
How much did you pay for that?

65
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,678
Well, it was a little extravagant,
but I got a good deal.

66
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,763
- Yeah, how much?
- Thousand bucks.

67
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,100
On a cat?

68
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,769
It's not a cat.

69
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,606
All right. Listen, ball boys.

70
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,775
My grandmother had one of these
when I was little...

71
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,443
...and it was the sweetest thing.

72
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,780
I mean, it was so cute, it would sit
in my lap and just purr all day long...

73
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,866
...and I would drag a shoe string
on the ground and it would chase it.

74
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,035
Free cats do that too, you know.

75
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,746
It's not a cat.

76
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,082
Look, guys,
I'm really excited about this, okay?

77
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,750
I don't care what you think.

78
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,254
I'm gonna go set up a little litter box
for Mrs. Whiskerson.

79
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,008
Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?

80
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,930
Hey, do you wanna get something to eat
or, uh...

81
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,474
...see how long we can throw this ball
back and forth?

82
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,477
- Uh, the ball thing.
- Yeah?

83
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,524
Hey, Ross, wouldn't it be great
if we could go for like two straight hours...

84
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,109
...without dropping it?

85
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:22,279
Uh, yeah, it would.

86
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,990
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

87
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,162
- Uh-oh.
- What?

88
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,830
I have to pee.

89
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,166
And Rachel's in the bathroom.

90
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,548
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it.

91
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,675
I know.

92
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,969
Don't switch hands, okay?

93
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,812
Hey, ladies.
What are you in here for?

94
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,402
Hey, Chandler, what are you doing here?

95
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,613
- Gary, I am here to report a crime.
- Yeah?

96
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,948
It is a crime that you and I
don't spend time together.

97
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,492
Ha, ha. What's up?

98
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,288
Uh, well, I heard that you were thinking
about asking Phoebe to move in with you...

99
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:17,376
...and I thought maybe we should have
a talk, you know, man to... well, me.

100
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,836
Sure, okay.

101
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,172
Um, are you crazy?

102
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,882
Are you insane?

103
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:28,136
If you live with Phoebe, you two
are gonna be, you know, living together.

104
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,806
Yeah, I considered that.
I just know it'd make me happy.

105
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,308
- Heh. You mean scared.
- No, I mean happy.

106
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,894
Scared happy.

107
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,606
- Chandler, what are you doing?
- I'm trying to open your eyes, my man.

108
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,609
Don't you see? If you live with Phoebe,
she is always gonna be there.

109
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,821
You're gonna get home, she's there.
You go to bed, she's there.

110
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,740
You wake up and oh, yes, she's there.

111
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,867
I know. I can't wait.

112
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,663
Were your parents happy or something?

113
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,957
Listen, Chandler, the way I see it...

114
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,501
...I was lucky enough to find someone
that I really love.

115
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,379
I just wanna be around her
as much as I can.

116
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,632
Wow, you know, when you say it,
it doesn't sound so scary.

117
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,094
- So you know what I'm talking about?
- Yeah, I think I do.

118
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,470
You know what?

119
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,473
You move in with her.
You move in right with her right now.

120
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,560
- Maybe I should move in with Monica.
- No, it's too soon for you guys.

121
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,856
You're right about that.

122
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,653
When they found the remains
of the Mesozoic mastodon...

123
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,489
...they discovered what appeared
to be the remains...

124
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,118
...of a Paleozoic amphibian in its jaws.

125
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,413
How did it get there?

126
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,542
Maybe this should be more
of a quiet game.

127
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,629
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

128
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,007
Joey, I left my watch
on the counter last night.

129
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,925
- It was here. Where is it?
- I don't know.

130
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,594
Well, come on, I'm late for work.

131
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,804
How do you know?
You don't have a watch.

132
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,560
Guys, could you stop throwing the ball
for one minute and just help me find it?

133
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,188
Oh, I don't know. Yeah, can't do it.

134
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,945
- What?
- Whatever you do, do not drop that ball.

135
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,616
- Yeah, we haven't dropped it in...
- Two hours, 27 minutes.

136
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,452
Really?

137
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,538
I'm not gonna be able
to make it in to work today.

138
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,832
Um, I don't feel very good.

139
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,959
Yes!

140
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:28,298
Wow, uh, for a second there,
I thought I was feeling better, but I'm not.

141
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,052
- Hey, Rach.
- Hey.

142
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:36,014
Check it out. Almost three hours
without dropping it.

143
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:39,518
Wow, congratulations.
That's quite a waste of time.

144
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,437
- Rach.
- Yeah.

145
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,439
You have scratches all over you.
What happened?

146
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,942
- Well, it's my cat.
- What?

147
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,402
- Oh, yeah, I got a cat.
- I don't want a cat.

148
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,030
- Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
- Yeah.

149
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,826
You guys, this cat is nothing like
my grandmother's cat.

150
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,954
It's not sweet. It's not cute.

151
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,122
I even dragged a string on the ground...

152
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,334
...and it just flipped out
and scratched the hell out of me.

153
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,923
And I swear... I know this sounds crazy,
but every time this cat hisses at me...

154
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,175
...I know it's saying, "Rachel."

155
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,269
Doesn't sound as crazy
as paying $1000 for a cat.

156
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,772
You paid $1000 for a cat
when you owe me 300?

157
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,817
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.

158
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,616
Hey.

159
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,618
Did you talk to Gary
about the moving in thing?

160
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,830
- Yes, I did, and I think you should do it.
- What?

161
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:46,793
He's a great guy and he loves you a lot.
You are a very lucky lady.

162
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,878
You are useless.

163
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,508
Freaking out about commitment
is the one thing you can do...

164
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,719
...and you can't even do that right. God.

165
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,638
Sorry. If he asked me,
I'd move in with him.

166
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,265
Oh!

167
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,185
Ooh, ooh, get out of here,
good-for-nothing.

168
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,899
- Hey, Chandler.
- Hey, Gar.

169
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,986
Hey, sweetie.

170
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:17,574
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah. Okay.

171
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,328
- You look very pretty today.
- Thanks. Okay.

172
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,913
- Here's the thing.
- Yeah.

173
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,208
You know, I really want this relationship
to move forward.

174
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,670
Because if you're not moving forward,
you know, you're just moving backwards.

175
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,882
Now, that's not true. If you're not
moving forward, you're staying still.

176
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,968
And staying still is good. Watch this.

177
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,722
- Phoebe?
- Yeah?

178
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,766
I want you to move in with me.

179
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,727
That is so sweet.

180
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,271
But don't you think
that it's a little it's too soon?

181
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,774
I mean, there's so much
we don't know about each other.

182
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,943
Oh.

183
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,404
Oh, okay. I get it.

184
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,618
I don't want us to jump into something
that we're not ready for, you know.

185
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,703
Uh-huh.

186
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,083
I really don't want
to mess up what we have.

187
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,711
I'm just worried it's gonna
be a big mistake.

188
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,296
Yeah.

189
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:18,134
Which is why my answer is yes.

190
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,012
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

191
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,223
You're so happy.

192
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,107
Monica, stop throwing it so hard.

193
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,902
We're on the same team.

194
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,615
Four hours? You guys have been
doing this for four hours?

195
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,283
That's right, baby.

196
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,161
- All right. Let me in.
- No, no. Don't do it.

197
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,372
What?

198
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,125
He's a dropper.

199
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,962
Oh, yeah. That's right.

200
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,714
I'm not a dropper.

201
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,342
It's really a three-person game,
you know?

202
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,470
It's throwing and catching.

203
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,764
All right.

204
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,769
Oh, oh, it's so hard.

205
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,904
Don't worry, guys.
It's not a cat.

206
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,409
Oh, my... Oh, good God.

207
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,912
I give up, you guys. I don't know
what I'm gonna do with this thing.

208
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,498
Baking it didn't help, huh?

209
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,462
Why don't you just take it back
to where you got it?

210
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,589
I tried. They won't take her back.

211
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:41,259
Maybe that's because
she's a minion of the Antichrist.

212
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,263
Rach, why won't they take it back?

213
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,974
Well, they said they would,
but would only give me store credit.

214
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,519
What am I gonna do,
get a thousand regular cats?

215
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,731
If you want, you can keep it
until you find out what to do with it.

216
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,317
No, Mon, that's not the point.
I'm out a thousand dollars...

217
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,027
...I'm all scratched up...

218
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,614
...and I'm stuck with this stupid cat
that looks like a hand.

219
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,161
Oh, my God.

220
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,122
The cat's made my eyes water.
Don't throw it to me.

221
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,000
My vision's been compromised.

222
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:18,087
Oh, God. Okay. Okay.

223
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,465
It's okay. Man, that was close.

224
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,384
Yeah, you almost overreacted
to something.

225
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,679
Hey.

226
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,432
- We have great news.
- We're moving in together. Isn't it great?

227
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,642
Yay!

228
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,561
- Congratulations.
- That's great.

229
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,271
- I know, I'm so excited.
- So am I.

230
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,192
Well, you're not more excited than I am.
No way. I'm the most excited. Ha.

231
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,319
Okay, I'll see you at the station later.

232
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,489
Okay, yeah, I'll see you later.
Don't forget about the moving-in.

233
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,700
So you're moving in with him?
What happened?

234
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,871
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad.
But maybe it'll be all right.

235
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,623
I do really like him a lot...

236
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,543
...and probably do it eventually anyway.

237
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,796
And plus, think of all the money
I'll save on stamps.

238
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,215
Why, do you write him a lot?

239
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,551
No, I just heard
when people live together...

240
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,178
...they split the cost
of stamps, don't they?

241
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,891
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's right.

242
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,812
Oh! Oh.

243
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,314
I'm sorry, the oven mitts
really freaked me out.

244
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,407
Hey, honey.

245
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,660
Did you find any apartments
in Brooklyn Heights?

246
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,036
No, nothing.

247
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,496
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

248
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,039
- Nothing at all?
- No.

249
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,125
As soon as something opens up,
we'll move in.

250
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,335
Unless it doesn't have a pool.
I need a pool.

251
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,591
- Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
- Uh-huh.

252
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,678
Take a seat.

253
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,474
You okay? You feel all right?

254
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,644
Yeah, I feel great because
we're moving in together.

255
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,938
So you, uh...

256
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,859
You checked the paper for listings
in Brooklyn Heights, right?

257
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,612
You checked the Post?

258
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,364
Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing.

259
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,868
- Can I get some water?
- In a minute.

260
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:18,082
- You checked today's Post?
- Um, yeah, today's.

261
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,461
Hmm. Because, uh, this is today's Post.

262
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,130
And, uh, these are the listings I found.

263
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,134
Brooklyn Heights, two bedrooms.
Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom.

264
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,512
Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights,
Brooklyn Heights.

265
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:36,559
Oh, are these for rent?
I thought people were just bragging.

266
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,437
Let me tell you what I think
might be going on here.

267
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,689
No, no, don't look at the table.
Look at me.

268
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,277
Okay, I think somebody asked someone
to move in with him.

269
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,322
And I think someone said yes,
but now she's having doubts...

270
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,449
...because things are moving too fast
for someone.

271
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,868
Does that sound at all possible to you?

272
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,539
Yes, yes. Yes, fine, I am someone.

273
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,752
You want me to say it? I have doubts.

274
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,796
I'm sorry.

275
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,757
- Phoebe.
- Yeah?

276
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,259
Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way.

277
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:14,430
I mean, it is soon, and there's a lot of
things we don't know about each other.

278
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,141
I just figured everything I know about you,
I really like.

279
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:21,562
The things I don't know, I get to learn in a
place with both our names on the mailbox.

280
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,607
That's so sweet.

281
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,319
Sweetheart, but none of that matters
if it's too soon for you.

282
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,948
It's fine. We don't have to move in together.
I just want you to be happy.

283
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,785
- Living with you would make me happy.
- Phoebe, you don't have to say that.

284
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,830
No, I really wanna live with you.
I wanna move in with you.

285
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,124
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

286
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,627
Definitely, yes. Let's live in an apartment
that we both live in.

287
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,797
- Oh, that's great.
- Oh, wait, one sec. One sec.

288
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,051
Hey, you. Behind the glass.
Who are you looking at?

289
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,097
I've always wanted to say that every time
I was in one of these rooms...

290
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,765
...which was never.

291
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:04,731
Show cat. Quality show cat.

292
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,775
- Show cat.
- Oh, my God.

293
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,111
What's wrong with your baby?

294
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,572
That's not a baby. That's a cat.

295
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,533
- Ew, it's creepy looking.
- Oh, no.

296
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,119
No, it's actually very sweet.
It's very sweet. Look.

297
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:26,252
- Yeah. Do you want it?
- Ha, ha. No, I hate cats.

298
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,254
Well, so then what are you doing to me?
Okay?

299
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,549
Just get out of here, all right? Move on.

300
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,677
- Jeez.
- Wow, what an unusual cat.

301
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,472
Yes, thank you. Exactly. You want it?

302
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,098
Maybe.

303
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,518
I was thinking about getting a cat.
I was just gonna go to the shelter, but...

304
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,272
- Okay. Why not?
- Oh, terrific. That'll be $2,000.

305
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,400
- Ha. What?
- Okay, a thousand.

306
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,778
I thought you wanted me
to adopt your cat?

307
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:56,824
Well, I do, but you're gonna have to look
at this as more of an investment than a cat.

308
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,118
Okay, yeah. I just wanted a cat.

309
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,870
Okay, okay, okay.

310
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,415
Obviously, you know how to haggle...

311
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,959
...so I'm not gonna try and
take you on, okay?

312
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,878
So $800, and I don't call the cops...

313
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,380
...which I should
because you are robbing me blind.

314
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,009
Blind. Just take the cat,
leave the money and run away.

315
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,470
Just run away. Damn it. Ugh.

316
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,264
Can't you at least smile or something?

317
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,604
Okay, did anybody just hear that?
Anybody?

318
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,656
- I'm starving.
- Come on, guys. Suck it up.

319
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,658
We're closing in on 10 hours.

320
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,868
It's gut-check time.

321
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,455
I don't know who made you the boss.
We invented this game.

322
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,458
Please. I made this game what it is.

323
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,544
Not fun anymore?

324
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,296
I'm still hungry.

325
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,132
All right, there's some pizza at my place.

326
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,217
We can eat with one hand, right?
Are you with me?

327
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,137
- I am.
- All right, let's go. Come on.

328
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,222
Let's go, Team Monica.

329
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,435
All right, we can work out the name later.

330
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,483
Rachel, what is your cat doing
in one of my bowls?

331
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,318
It's not. I'm defrosting a chicken.

332
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,656
Oh, I sold, uh, Mrs. Whiskerson.

333
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,533
Oh, thank God.

334
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,327
- Did you get your money back?
- Yeah, $1500.

335
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,621
Wow, you made a profit?

336
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,586
- I just came for the red velvet pillow.
- Oh, yeah.

337
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,006
- There you go.
- Thanks, Rachel.

338
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,176
And, uh, don't forget,
you can come visit her any time you want.

339
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,053
Oh, good. Great. I'll keep that in mind.

340
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:48,561
Ahem, hey. So, what is this,
some kind of snake or something?

341
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,282
I really like waking up with you.

342
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,035
I like waking up with you too.

343
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,163
Oh, it's such a beautiful morning.

344
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,873
I could stay here all day.

345
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,917
That would be great.

346
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,669
- We could have breakfast in bed.
- Wait, just a second.

347
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,048
Oh!

348
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,425
Oh, no.

349
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:26,098
All right. Come on, Monica.
Look alive. Come on, look alive.

350
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,438
Oh, good. You're all up.

351
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:36,108
Phoebe, it's six o'clock in the morning.
Why aren't you at Gary's?

352
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,069
- Oh, yeah. That's over.
- What?

353
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,239
Come on, Gary's such a great guy.
Whatever the problem, you can work it out.

354
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,366
- He shot a bird.
- Oh, that is over.

355
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,786
- I'm sorry.
- That's terrible.

356
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,122
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'll be all right.

357
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:54,085
- Oh, hey, here, Pheebs.
- Oh. Nah, I don't feel like playing.

358
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,176
It's okay. It's okay.

359
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,138
Just pretend that it didn't happen, okay?
No one needs to know.

360
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,266
Phoebe's not an official ball player.

361
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,477
I mean, only official ball players
can drop the ball.

362
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,605
- Come on.
- Let's go.

363
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,108
Phoebe, honey,
you wanna get breakfast?

364
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,151
- Yeah.
- Okay. Okay, let's race.

365
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,196
First one there wins. Ha, ha.

366
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,367
- You guys wanna eat here?
- Yeah.

367
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,749
Oh, man, that was great, huh?

368
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,085
Can you believe how long
we threw that ball around?

369
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,462
It is amazing it lasted that long.

370
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,381
I know. My arm is killing me.

371
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,259
No, I meant with the dropper over here.

372
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,511
You know, how did I get
this reputation as a dropper?

373
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,222
I am anything but a dropper.

374
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,932
Ross.
