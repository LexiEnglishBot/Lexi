1
00:00:08,987 --> 00:00:10,318
Come in.

2
00:00:10,822 --> 00:00:13,347
l've been waiting for you.

3
00:00:16,562 --> 00:00:17,620
Hi, l just--

4
00:00:18,864 --> 00:00:20,661
Oh, my God!
Monica!

5
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:22,366
Oh, my God!

6
00:00:22,568 --> 00:00:24,160
l'm sorry! l was--

7
00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:26,136
l was taking a nap.

8
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:29,465
Since when do you
take naps in that position?

9
00:00:31,677 --> 00:00:35,010
Tell me you were waiting for a guy.
Please tell me.

10
00:00:35,213 --> 00:00:37,238
Yes, l was.
A guy.

11
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,984
From work.

12
00:00:40,218 --> 00:00:42,345
l'm seeing a guy from work!

13
00:00:44,856 --> 00:00:48,986
That cute waiter guy that looks like
a nonthreatening Ray Liotta?

14
00:00:50,495 --> 00:00:51,985
That one!

15
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,859
Give me a second.
l'm just going to grab a jacket.

16
00:00:56,068 --> 00:01:00,004
When l get back,
l want every little detail.

17
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,906
Maybe that's him.

18
00:01:08,847 --> 00:01:10,872
lt's just Joey and Ross.

19
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,749
Why aren't you at the movie?

20
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:16,385
Ross was so loud, they threw us out.

21
00:01:16,588 --> 00:01:19,955
l had to talk loud
because the movie was loud!

22
00:01:22,194 --> 00:01:25,891
-He's talking to London.
-Did he get in touch with Emily?

23
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:31,035
No, not yet. He's hoping that someone
will help him get in touch with her.

24
00:01:31,236 --> 00:01:35,935
l don't care if l said some
other girl's name, you prissy old twit!

25
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:40,139
Way to suck up to the family!

26
00:01:47,486 --> 00:01:52,583
l'm so glad you're all here. My office
finally got wrinkle-free fax paper!

27
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,257
The One Where Phoebe Hates PBS

28
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:48,039
Hi, is this Nanny Hopkins?
l'm looking for Emily.

29
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:49,339
Waltham.

30
00:02:49,948 --> 00:02:55,614
Oh, l'm sorry.
ls this 0-1 -1 -4-4-7-4-2...

31
00:02:55,787 --> 00:03:00,850
...9-3-4-7-4-2-6-7?

32
00:03:02,194 --> 00:03:04,628
Oh, it's ''4-3,'' not 4-2.

33
00:03:04,796 --> 00:03:07,458
Well, which 4-2?

34
00:03:10,168 --> 00:03:12,159
No, no! Vomit tux!

35
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:15,196
Don't worry,
l had it dry-cleaned.

36
00:03:15,373 --> 00:03:16,362
Vomit tux?

37
00:03:17,008 --> 00:03:18,873
Who vomited on--?

38
00:03:19,177 --> 00:03:21,873
You know what?
What you up to, Joe?

39
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,008
They're doing
this telethon thing on TV.

40
00:03:25,283 --> 00:03:27,774
And my agent
got me a job as cohost!

41
00:03:27,986 --> 00:03:29,476
That's great!

42
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:33,623
A little good deed for PBS,
plus some TV exposure.

43
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:36,690
That's the kind of math
Joey likes to do.

44
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:39,663
Oh, PBS!

45
00:03:40,565 --> 00:03:43,363
-What's wrong with PBS?
-What's right with them?

46
00:03:44,903 --> 00:03:46,632
Why don't you like PBS?

47
00:03:46,838 --> 00:03:51,969
Right after my Mom killed herself,
l was in a bad place, personally.

48
00:03:54,513 --> 00:03:57,141
l thought l'd write
to <i>Sesame Street.</i>

49
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:00,318
Because they were nice
when l was a little kid.

50
00:04:00,552 --> 00:04:02,213
No one ever wrote back.

51
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,253
A lot of those muppets
don't have thumbs.

52
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:11,489
All l got was a lousy key chain, and
by that time, l was living in a box.

53
00:04:11,696 --> 00:04:13,391
l didn't have keys!

54
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:15,760
l'm sorry, Pheebs.

55
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:19,333
l wanted to do a good deed,
like you did with the babies.

56
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:23,869
This isn't a good deed. You just
want to get on TV. This is selfish.

57
00:04:24,075 --> 00:04:28,068
What about you having
those babies for your brother?

58
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,872
That's selfish!

59
00:04:31,783 --> 00:04:33,580
What are you talking about?

60
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:37,016
lt was a nice thing,
but it made you feel good, right?

61
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:38,449
Yeah, so?

62
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,352
lt made you feel good
so that makes it selfish.

63
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:45,029
Look, there's no
unselfish good deeds. Sorry.

64
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,961
Yes, there are totally
good deeds that are selfless!

65
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:51,032
May l ask for one example?

66
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:54,103
Yeah, it's--
You know, there's--

67
00:04:54,306 --> 00:04:56,069
No, you may not!

68
00:04:57,809 --> 00:04:59,936
Because all people are selfish.

69
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:02,112
Are you calling me selfish?

70
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,712
Are you calling you people?

71
00:05:07,118 --> 00:05:11,987
Sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs,
but selfless good deeds don't exist.

72
00:05:12,457 --> 00:05:14,254
You know the deal
on Santa Claus?

73
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,291
l'll find a selfless good deed.
l'm going to beat you, you evil genius!

74
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:29,235
Oh, my God! lt's Emily!

75
00:05:29,474 --> 00:05:31,465
lt's Emily, everyone!

76
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,643
l'm only ringing to say
stop harassing my relatives. Goodbye.

77
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,684
You can hang up, but l'll keep calling
everyone in England...

78
00:05:42,954 --> 00:05:46,685
...if that's what it takes
to get you to talk to me.

79
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:48,587
Really? About what?

80
00:05:48,793 --> 00:05:51,660
Look, you're my wife.
We're married.

81
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:53,421
You know, l love you.

82
00:05:53,632 --> 00:05:55,759
<i>I really miss you.</i>

83
00:05:57,435 --> 00:05:58,800
l miss you too.

84
00:05:59,537 --> 00:06:01,164
<i>At least, I think I do.</i>

85
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:03,503
She's talking.

86
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:11,680
When you said ''the deal with Santa,''
you meant...?

87
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:13,373
That he doesn't exist.

88
00:06:13,618 --> 00:06:14,846
Right.

89
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:23,125
Chandler, have you heard
about Monica's secret boyfriend?

90
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:27,129
Yeah, she might have mentioned him.

91
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:32,231
So, Mon, when are we going
to meet this new, secret waiter man?

92
00:06:32,804 --> 00:06:35,637
l don't think he's
up to meeting everyone yet.

93
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:38,342
Yeah, l don't think he's up to it.

94
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:42,802
l want to meet this guy
who's the best sex she ever had.

95
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:45,311
Really?

96
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:49,718
That's what you heard?
You said that?

97
00:06:50,188 --> 00:06:51,382
l might have.

98
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:56,058
Why is that funny?

99
00:06:56,995 --> 00:06:59,327
Because l'm very happy for him.

100
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:02,196
And you!
You lucky dog!

101
00:07:06,571 --> 00:07:09,005
She's willing to work
on the relationship.

102
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:10,430
That's great!

103
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:11,698
ln London.

104
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,776
She wants me to move to London.

105
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:16,037
But you live here.

106
00:07:19,451 --> 00:07:20,713
You know that.

107
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:24,722
-What will you do?
-l don't know.

108
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:28,484
-l mean, l can't leave Ben.
-You can just video-conference with him.

109
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:32,860
l'm not ready to have a child.

110
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,924
l bet if l talked to Carol and Susan...

111
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:41,001
...l could convince them
to move to London with Ben.

112
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:44,003
l'm sure your ex-wife
would be more than happy to move...

113
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:47,007
...so you can patch things up
with your new wife.

114
00:07:49,381 --> 00:07:51,076
lt could happen.

115
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:57,988
Ross, we are not moving to London.
We already have lives here.

116
00:07:58,156 --> 00:08:01,387
But it'd be great.
They have great theater...

117
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:04,255
...great accents.

118
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:07,158
Tea.

119
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,033
They have a queen.

120
00:08:11,236 --> 00:08:13,431
-So?
-She's a woman.

121
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,207
-Daddy!
-Hey!

122
00:08:19,377 --> 00:08:22,813
Guess what? We're moving to London!

123
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:26,478
-Who's going to London?
-Nobody's going to London.

124
00:08:26,718 --> 00:08:29,346
Welcome to London, governor.

125
00:08:29,954 --> 00:08:33,549
Right, right. lt'll be great
because we'll have Big Ben and little Ben...

126
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:35,920
...in the same city.

127
00:08:36,795 --> 00:08:38,660
Go pack!

128
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:41,825
See? See, he wants to go.

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,595
Yeah, we leave all our big decisions
to the 3-year-old.

130
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:49,702
Come on, come on.
lt'll be just like <i>Three's Company...</i>

131
00:08:49,874 --> 00:08:52,968
...only there's a kid and my wife...

132
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:56,272
...and you're the gay ones.

133
00:09:01,352 --> 00:09:03,752
How you doing? Welcome.
Good to see you.

134
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,589
This'll be your phone.

135
00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:11,890
That's great.

136
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:15,064
But l'm not really
expecting a lot of calls.

137
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:17,758
No, you answer it
and take pledges.

138
00:09:18,336 --> 00:09:19,394
But l'm the host.

139
00:09:19,671 --> 00:09:23,163
Gary Collins is the host.
You'll be answering the phone.

140
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:28,568
You don't seem to understand.
l was Dr. Drake Ramoray.

141
00:09:28,913 --> 00:09:31,279
Well, here's your phone, doctor.

142
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:36,918
l can't believe l can't find
a selfless good deed.

143
00:09:37,188 --> 00:09:39,520
You know that old guy
that lives next to me?

144
00:09:39,757 --> 00:09:43,090
l snuck over there and raked up
the leaves on his front stoop.

145
00:09:43,361 --> 00:09:47,388
But he caught me, and he
force-fed me cider and cookies.

146
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,565
Then l felt wonderful.
That old jackass!

147
00:09:53,304 --> 00:09:56,740
Maybe Joey's right.
Maybe all good deeds are selfish.

148
00:09:56,975 --> 00:10:00,433
l will find a selfless good deed.
l gave birth to three children...

149
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:04,443
...and l won't let them be raised
in a world where Joey's right!

150
00:10:07,152 --> 00:10:09,643
Can l ask you a cooking question?

151
00:10:09,888 --> 00:10:11,788
lf you're cooking on the stove...

152
00:10:12,056 --> 00:10:15,924
...that means your new boyfriend
is better in bed than Richard?

153
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:21,427
ls he?

154
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:27,633
l think l'll respect the privacy
of my new, secret boyfriend.

155
00:10:27,972 --> 00:10:29,234
Why?

156
00:10:31,676 --> 00:10:33,007
lf this guy was me...

157
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:37,510
...and it's me who'd learned that it was
me who was the best you'd ever had...

158
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:39,079
...l'd be like this:

159
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,349
<i>All right, Emily.</i>

160
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:52,490
As much as l love you...

161
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:56,097
...l'm sorry, l can't
move to London without Ben.

162
00:10:56,668 --> 00:10:59,159
l understand that would be difficult.

163
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,136
Would you consider moving here?
You were moving here anyway.

164
00:11:03,341 --> 00:11:05,275
<i>Why can't you just do that?</i>

165
00:11:05,843 --> 00:11:07,777
l don't know. lt's just--

166
00:11:09,948 --> 00:11:14,851
But l know that even though l've been
a complete idiot up till now...

167
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:16,814
...you have to come here.

168
00:11:17,288 --> 00:11:20,155
<i>You have to, so we can</i>
<i>work this out together.</i>

169
00:11:21,226 --> 00:11:22,454
All right.

170
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:25,188
Did you just say ''all right''?

171
00:11:25,396 --> 00:11:27,956
l did.
Now l'm the idiot.

172
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,293
Emily, that is so great!

173
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:31,661
<i>It'll be great!</i>

174
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:35,828
We're going to be
like two idiots in love!

175
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:42,411
There's one thing that
really scares me still.

176
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,978
-Yes, tell me.
-<i>You must understand...</i>

177
00:11:45,216 --> 00:11:48,083
...how humiliating it was
for me at the altar...

178
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:50,480
...in front of my family and friends.

179
00:11:50,822 --> 00:11:53,655
l know. l am so sorry.

180
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:57,692
And then, after deciding
to forgive you...

181
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:01,262
...seeing you at the airport,
catching our plane with her.

182
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:04,391
Again, very sorry.

183
00:12:06,337 --> 00:12:09,272
l mean, l can't be
in the same room as her.

184
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,101
lt drives me mad thinking of you
being in the same room as her.

185
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,570
Emily, there is nothing
between Rachel and me.

186
00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:21,079
<i>I love you.</i>

187
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,953
All right.

188
00:12:24,522 --> 00:12:28,117
l'll come to New York,
and we'll try to make this work.

189
00:12:28,626 --> 00:12:29,718
That's so great!

190
00:12:29,927 --> 00:12:33,556
As long as you
don't see Rachel anymore.

191
00:12:41,372 --> 00:12:44,705
l asked Emily
if she would come to New York.

192
00:12:44,976 --> 00:12:46,534
And she said yes.

193
00:12:46,911 --> 00:12:47,900
Great!

194
00:12:50,281 --> 00:12:53,444
Only if l promise
never to see Rachel again.

195
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:55,118
What? You can't--

196
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,378
What did you say?

197
00:12:56,621 --> 00:13:01,149
l'd think about it. How am l
supposed to make this decision?

198
00:13:03,227 --> 00:13:05,457
l'm actually asking you!

199
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:10,225
Rachel is one of your best friends.

200
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:13,797
But Emily's his wife!

201
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:15,267
That's true!

202
00:13:17,342 --> 00:13:20,277
You can't just cut Rachel
out of your life!

203
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,308
That's true!

204
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:26,113
Thanks for the help.
Problem solved!

205
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:36,324
When will you be on TV?

206
00:13:37,128 --> 00:13:40,097
There was kind of a mix-up
in my agent's office...

207
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:42,765
...but l'm still on TV,
and that's good exposure.

208
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:45,267
You're not on TV.

209
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:50,800
How about now?

210
00:13:53,378 --> 00:13:54,868
There he is!

211
00:13:55,113 --> 00:13:56,944
<i>Hello, New York!</i>

212
00:13:58,883 --> 00:14:02,284
<i>Maybe just put the whole duck in there.</i>
<i>Who cares?</i>

213
00:14:02,487 --> 00:14:04,011
<i>Now I got the legs.</i>

214
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:12,826
How many times have l told you
to never watch the cooking channel?

215
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:18,535
l need that broiling pan
that Joey borrowed.

216
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,360
That was yours?

217
00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:24,641
We used it when the duck
was throwing up caterpillars.

218
00:14:25,543 --> 00:14:28,239
Williams-Sonoma,
fall catalog, page 27.

219
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:30,037
Expect it in 4 to 6 weeks.

220
00:14:33,384 --> 00:14:36,353
Joey's at the telethon
for the rest of the day.

221
00:14:36,587 --> 00:14:38,487
We have the place to ourselves.

222
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:40,156
Yeah, so?

223
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:45,091
Maybe you'd want to book some time
with ''the best you've ever had.''

224
00:14:46,497 --> 00:14:48,362
You know what, champ?

225
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:49,861
l think l'll pass.

226
00:14:50,168 --> 00:14:51,157
Why?

227
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,417
What's your point?

228
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:11,815
With all the stupid gloating,
would you want to sleep with you?

229
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:15,390
Well, l think l'd be a little out of my league,
but l'd give it a shot.

230
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:21,423
PBS Telethon.

231
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:27,201
l just wanted to let you know
that l found a selfless good deed.

232
00:15:27,438 --> 00:15:30,271
l went down to the park
and l let a bee sting me.

233
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,570
What good is that going to do?

234
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:37,407
lt helps the bee look tough
in front of his bee friends.

235
00:15:38,115 --> 00:15:40,845
The bee is happy,
and l am definitely not.

236
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:44,746
You know, the bee probably
died after he stung you.

237
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,954
Damn it!

238
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,225
Back on in 30 seconds, people!

239
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,375
Excuse me,
would you mind switching with me?

240
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,635
No way.
l'm in the shot, man.

241
00:16:08,613 --> 00:16:11,605
-You've been here all day!
-l'm taking pledges.

242
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,316
And we're on three, two....

243
00:16:15,152 --> 00:16:17,120
Welcome back to our fall telethon.

244
00:16:17,321 --> 00:16:20,154
lf you've been enjoying
<i>Cirque du Soleil...</i>

245
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:24,327
...and you'd like to see more,
it's very simple.

246
00:16:24,595 --> 00:16:27,587
All you have to do
is call in a pledge...

247
00:16:27,832 --> 00:16:32,895
...and tell one of our volunteers
what type of programming you--

248
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,437
-Quick broiling pan question--
-Yes, it really does cost that much.

249
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,773
Maybe next time your duck can puke
in something from Pottery Barn.

250
00:16:46,284 --> 00:16:50,220
That's it. l cannot make this decision.
lt is too difficult.

251
00:16:50,521 --> 00:16:53,615
l leave it entirely
up to the gods of fate.

252
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,791
A Magic 8 Ball?

253
00:16:58,062 --> 00:17:00,724
You can't make this decision
with a toy!

254
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:02,900
lt's not a toy.

255
00:17:04,468 --> 00:17:06,868
l don't know what else to do!

256
00:17:07,104 --> 00:17:11,370
l either keep my wife
and lose one of my best friends...

257
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:15,409
...or l get divorced
for the second time before l'm 30.

258
00:17:15,613 --> 00:17:18,980
lf anyone else has
a better suggestion, let's hear it.

259
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,582
Because l got nothing!
Don't be shy.

260
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:24,083
Any suggestion will do.

261
00:17:29,594 --> 00:17:31,152
Okay, then.

262
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:35,956
Here we go.

263
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:38,893
Magic 8 Ball...

264
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:41,900
...should l never see Rachel again?

265
00:17:45,676 --> 00:17:46,802
''Ask Again Later.''

266
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,671
Later is not good enough!

267
00:17:57,955 --> 00:17:58,944
''Ask Again Later.''

268
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,316
What the hell?

269
00:18:00,524 --> 00:18:02,856
This is broken! lt is broken!

270
00:18:04,195 --> 00:18:05,787
Let me see.

271
00:18:06,831 --> 00:18:09,322
Will Chandler have sex tonight?

272
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:11,361
''Don't Count On lt.''

273
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,931
Seems like it works to me.

274
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:21,377
Okay, one more time.

275
00:18:22,446 --> 00:18:25,540
Should l never see Rachel again?

276
00:18:27,718 --> 00:18:30,516
Magic 8 Ball! What did you ask?

277
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:35,882
Does...

278
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,429
...Rachel get to pick the movie
that we're all going to see tonight?

279
00:18:40,598 --> 00:18:42,759
Excellent. What's the answer?

280
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:48,067
Looks like Stella's gonna get
her groove back tonight!

281
00:18:51,142 --> 00:18:53,042
What? l heard it was good.

282
00:18:56,347 --> 00:18:58,042
PBS Telethon.

283
00:18:58,215 --> 00:18:59,204
<i>Hi, Joey.</i>

284
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:00,506
Hey, Pheebs.

285
00:19:00,718 --> 00:19:02,208
l'd like
to make a pledge.

286
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,488
l would like to donate $200.

287
00:19:04,689 --> 00:19:05,883
Two hundred dollars?

288
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,954
You sure?
After what <i>Sesame Street</i> did to you?

289
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,628
l'm still mad at them,
but they bring happiness...

290
00:19:11,862 --> 00:19:15,320
...to lots of kids
whose moms didn't kill themselves.

291
00:19:17,168 --> 00:19:22,128
By supporting them, l'm doing a good
thing, but l'm not happy about it.

292
00:19:22,406 --> 00:19:24,931
So there!
A selfless good deed.

293
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:27,804
You don't feel good
about donating the money?

294
00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:31,504
No, it sucks!
l was saving up to buy a hamster.

295
00:19:32,216 --> 00:19:34,810
A hamster?
Those things are, like, $ 1 0.

296
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:37,249
Not the one l had my eye on.

297
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:41,758
<i>It looks like we have surpassed</i>
<i>last year's pledge total.</i>

298
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:43,015
<i>Thank you!</i>

299
00:19:43,894 --> 00:19:48,831
<i>And the pledge that did it</i>
<i>was taken by one of our volunteers.</i>

300
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:54,231
<i>Oh, boy! And may I say,</i>
<i>one of our sharpest dressed volunteers.</i>

301
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:57,233
<i>Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!</i>

302
00:19:57,441 --> 00:19:58,533
Oh, look!

303
00:19:58,743 --> 00:20:00,370
Joey's on TV!

304
00:20:00,578 --> 00:20:01,840
lsn't that great?

305
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:05,675
My pledge got Joey on TV!
That makes me feel so--

306
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:07,111
Oh, no!

307
00:20:14,391 --> 00:20:15,380
Look...

308
00:20:15,593 --> 00:20:19,859
...l got carried away before,
but there's something you got to know.

309
00:20:20,064 --> 00:20:24,558
lf l'm the best, it's only
because you made me the best.

310
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,037
Keep talking.

311
00:20:29,106 --> 00:20:30,767
l was nothing before you.

312
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,236
Call the other girls and ask.

313
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:36,136
Which wouldn't take long.

314
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:40,447
But when l'm with you,
and we're together...

315
00:20:40,718 --> 00:20:43,312
...oh, my God!

316
00:20:48,425 --> 00:20:51,155
-Really?
-Oh, my God!

317
00:20:54,398 --> 00:20:58,300
l understand if you never
want to sleep with me again.

318
00:20:58,569 --> 00:21:00,332
But that would be wrong.

319
00:21:01,472 --> 00:21:03,064
We're too good.

320
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,908
We owe it to sex!

321
00:21:08,245 --> 00:21:09,269
lf we owe it!

322
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:14,111
Oh, my!

323
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,148
When will Joey be home?

324
00:21:17,521 --> 00:21:20,149
l was kind of hoping
we could do this without him.

325
00:21:22,126 --> 00:21:24,924
No, no, no!
Leave the gloves on.

326
00:21:25,663 --> 00:21:27,096
l cleaned the bathroom.

327
00:21:27,331 --> 00:21:29,526
Why don't we lose the gloves.

328
00:21:33,204 --> 00:21:36,196
All right.
Let's show them how it's done.

329
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:41,300
-You know that wasn't part of it?
-l know.

330
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,026
You ready?
We're going to be late.

331
00:21:59,296 --> 00:22:02,197
-For what?
-For Stella, remember?

332
00:22:02,466 --> 00:22:05,196
She's getting her groove back
in 20 minutes.

333
00:22:06,737 --> 00:22:09,331
l totally forgot about that.

334
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:13,802
Can l take a rain check?
l'm waiting for a call from Emily.

335
00:22:14,979 --> 00:22:16,674
Sure, l guess.

336
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:19,572
l hear you don't have to
go to London.

337
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,652
lt's not that easy. There's still
a lot of relationship stuff.

338
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:28,215
Like what?

339
00:22:28,492 --> 00:22:30,016
Just stuff.

340
00:22:30,227 --> 00:22:33,993
You know, kind of what Emily wants.

341
00:22:34,698 --> 00:22:36,723
Talk to me.
Maybe l can help.

342
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:41,061
You can't help.

343
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,608
l have to do this
without your help.
