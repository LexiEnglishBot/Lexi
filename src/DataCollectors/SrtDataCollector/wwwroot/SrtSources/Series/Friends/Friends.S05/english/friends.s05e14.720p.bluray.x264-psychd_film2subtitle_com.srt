1
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:06,922
Oh, hey, you guys, look.
Ugly Naked Guy's putting stuff in boxes.

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,757
Oh.

3
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:13,595
Huh. I'd say from the looks of it,
our naked buddy is moving.

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:17,683
Ironically, most of the boxes
seem to be labeled "Clothes."

5
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,353
Aw, I'm going to miss that big
old squishy butt.

6
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,773
And we're done
with the chicken fried rice.

7
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:29,153
Hey. Hey, if he's moving,
maybe I should try to get his place.

8
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,696
- Oh, yeah.
- Good idea.

9
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,948
It would be so cool
to live across from you guys.

10
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,284
Yeah, hey, then we could do
that telephone thing...

11
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,120
...you know, where you have a can,
we have a can...

12
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,539
...and it's connected by a string.

13
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,127
Or we could do
the actual telephone thing.

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,762
Oh, my God. I love this apartment.

15
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,305
Isn't it perfect?

16
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:42,142
I can't believe I never realized
how great it is.

17
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:45,062
That is because your eye
immediately goes to the big naked man.

18
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:47,689
It's amazing.

19
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,901
You better hurry up and fill out
an application, or I'll beat you to it.

20
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,028
Oh, heh.

21
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,660
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm
gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.

22
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,876
Oh, look. There's Monica and Chandler.
Hey!

23
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,753
Hey, you guys! Hey!

24
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:14,883
Oh!

25
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,761
Aah! Aah!

26
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,683
Aah! Chandler and Monica.
Chandler and Monica.

27
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,309
Oh, my God.

28
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,437
- Chandler and Monica!
- Oh, my God!

29
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,523
Oh, my eyes! My eyes!

30
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,608
- Phoebe. Phoebe.
- Ow!

31
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,026
It's okay. It's okay.

32
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,195
- No, they're doing it!
- I know.

33
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,364
- I know. I know.
- You know?

34
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,825
Yes, I know, and Joey knows,
but Ross doesn't...

35
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,493
...so you have to stop screaming!

36
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,078
Hey, what's going on?

37
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,541
- What?
- Nothing.

38
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,752
Oh, God, we're just so excited
that you might get this apartment.

39
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,631
- Actually, it looks really good.
- Aah! It looks pretty good!

40
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:56,800
Get in here! Come on!

41
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,186
You mean whenever
Monica and Chandler were, like...

42
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,564
...doing laundry
or going grocery shopping?

43
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,901
All that time Monica spent on the phone
with sad Linda from camp?

44
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,445
Uh-huh.
Doing it, doing it, phone doing it.

45
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,281
I can't believe it.

46
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,950
I mean, I think it's great. For him.

47
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,660
She might be able to do better.

48
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,248
- Hey, you guys.
- Joey, come here. Come here.

49
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,792
Phoebe just found out
about Monica and Chandler.

50
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,545
You mean how they're friends
and nothing more?

51
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,299
No. No, Joey, she knows.

52
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,677
We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment
and saw them doing it through the window.

53
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,806
Actually, we saw them doing it
up against the window.

54
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,978
Okay, so now they know you know,
and they don't know Rachel knows?

55
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,232
Yes, but you know what?
It doesn't matter who knows what.

56
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,610
Now enough of us know
that we could just tell them we know.

57
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,821
Now all the lying and the secrets
will finally be over.

58
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:03,825
Or we could not tell them we know
and have a little fun of our own.

59
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,037
Well, what do you mean?

60
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,373
You know, every time they say
they're doing laundry...

61
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,166
...we'll give them laundry to do.

62
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,462
- Oh, I would enjoy that.
- No, no, no.

63
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,757
Wait, Rach, you know what would be
even more fun? Telling them.

64
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,761
- Yeah, no, I want to do Phoebe's thing.
- I can't take any...

65
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:26,098
You don't have to do anything.
Just don't tell them that we know.

66
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,600
No. I can't take any more secrets.

67
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:32,062
I got your secrets, I got their secrets.
I got secrets of my own, you know.

68
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,733
- You don't have any secrets.
- Oh, yeah?

69
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:40,529
Well, you don't know about Hugsy,
my bedtime penguin pal.

70
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,702
So, ahem, um...

71
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,245
How are we going to mess with them?

72
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,291
Well, you could use your position
as the roommate.

73
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:56,128
And then I would use, you know,
the strongest tool at my disposal.

74
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,088
My sexuality.

75
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,967
- Hello, children.
- Hey.

76
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,428
Okay. Watch, learn,
and don't eat my cookie.

77
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,057
- Hey.
- Hey.

78
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,643
Ooh. Wow, that jacket
looks great on you.

79
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,688
- Really?
- Yeah. The material looks so soft.

80
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,690
Oh, hello, Mr. Bicep.

81
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,319
You've been working out?

82
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,571
Well, I try to, you know, squeeze things.

83
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,412
Are you okay?

84
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,497
Well, if you really wanna know...

85
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,541
Oh, I can't tell you this.

86
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,210
Phoebe, it's me,
you can tell me anything.

87
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,630
Well, actually, you're the one person
I can't tell this to.

88
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,425
And the one person I want to the most.

89
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,346
What's going on?

90
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,892
I think it's just, you know,
that I haven't been with a guy in so long...

91
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,478
...and you know how sometimes
you're looking for something...

92
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:58,565
...and you don't see that it's right there
in front of you, sipping coffee...

93
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,068
Oh, no. Have I said too much?

94
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,782
Well, just something to think about.
I know I will.

95
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,285
Ooh. Ha, ha.

96
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,130
- You are so cute.
- Heh.

97
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,132
How did you get to be so cute?

98
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,135
Well, my grandfather was Swedish.

99
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,971
And my grandmother was actually
a tiny little bunny.

100
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,017
Okay, now you're even cuter.

101
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,230
You know, that is a popular
opinion today, I must say.

102
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,439
What?

103
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,234
The weirdest thing happened
at the coffeehouse.

104
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,069
I think Phoebe was hitting on me.

105
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,030
What are you talking about?

106
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,282
I'm telling you,
I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.

107
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,122
- It's not possible.
- Ow.

108
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,962
I'm sorry, it's just Phoebe's just
always thought you were charming...

109
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,256
...in a sexless kind of way.

110
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,384
Oh, well, you know,
I can't hear that enough.

111
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,929
I'm sorry, I just think
you misunderstood her.

112
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,765
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay?
She was all over me.

113
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,268
She touched my bicep,
for crying out loud.

114
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,019
This bicep?

115
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,148
Well, it's not flexed right now.

116
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,906
Hey, Mon, what are you doing?
Want to come see a movie with us?

117
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,910
Uh, actually, I was going
to do some laundry.

118
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:40,208
- Chandler, you want to do it with me?
- Sure, I'll do it with you.

119
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,879
Okay, great. Hold on a second.

120
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,966
Unh. Here you go.

121
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,220
You don't mind, do you?
That would really help me out a lot. Thanks.

122
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,057
Ha, ha. You know what?
I don't think I have enough quarters.

123
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,101
Oh, I have quarters.

124
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,691
- Hey.
- Hey, Ross, any word on the apartment yet?

125
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:08,528
Well, I called over there, and it turns out
Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself.

126
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,572
And he's already had like 100 applicants.

127
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,866
- Oh.
- No, no, I've got the edge.

128
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,827
I know it's not exactly ethical,
but I sent him a bribe...

129
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,205
...to tip the scales in my direction.

130
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,373
Yeah. Check it out,
you can see it from the window.

131
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,838
Oh, is it that pinball machine
with the big bow on it?

132
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,173
No.

133
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,592
That new mountain bike?

134
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:31,968
No.

135
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,013
Well, what did you send?

136
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,058
A basket of mini muffins.

137
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,603
There's a whole table
of mini muffin baskets.

138
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,522
Which one did you send?

139
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,815
The small one.

140
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,903
What? You actually thought that basket
was gonna get you the apartment?

141
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,446
Well, yeah.

142
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:56,326
Someone sent us a basket at work once
and people went crazy over those muffins.

143
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,203
It was the best day.

144
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,664
Your work makes me sad.

145
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,210
Oh, man, I want that place so much.

146
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,129
And I was so sure
that was going to work.

147
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,466
There's 12 bucks
I'll never see again.

148
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,761
All right, we'd better go
if we're gonna catch that movie.

149
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,097
- Bye.
- Bye.

150
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,225
Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.

151
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,316
Okay, did you see that?
With the inappropriate, and the pinching?

152
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,651
Actually, I did.

153
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,404
So now do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

154
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,450
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
She knows about us.

155
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,702
Are you serious?

156
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:41,204
Phoebe knows,
and she's just trying to freak us out.

157
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,790
That's the only explanation for it.

158
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:51,381
Okay, but what about my pinchable butt
and my bulging biceps?

159
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,133
She knows.

160
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,015
Joey.

161
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,725
Yeah?

162
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,312
Phoebe knows about us.

163
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,272
Well, I didn't tell them.

164
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,358
Them? Who's "them"?

165
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:14,112
Uh, Phoebe and Joey.

166
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,198
Joey.

167
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,825
And Rachel.

168
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,995
Look, I would have told you,
but they made me promise not to tell.

169
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,747
- Oh, man.
- I'm sorry.

170
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,665
But, hey, it's over now, right?

171
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,751
Because you can tell them
you know they know...

172
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,337
...and I can go back to knowing
absolutely nothing.

173
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,967
- Unless...
- No, not "unless." This must end now.

174
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,846
Oh, man, they think they are so slick
messing with us.

175
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:43,224
But they don't know
that we know that they know.

176
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,603
- So...
- Ah, yes.

177
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,689
The messers become the messees.

178
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,987
Oh, Ross, honey,
you gotta stop torturing yourself.

179
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,239
Why don't you just find
another apartment?

180
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,326
I've already looked at
like a thousand apartments this month.

181
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,870
None of them even compares
to that one.

182
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,747
You know what you should do?

183
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:10,126
You should find out what his hobbies are
and then use that to bond with him.

184
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,295
Yeah. Like if I wanted something
from Joey...

185
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,675
...I would strike up a conversation
about, say, um, sandwiches...

186
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,762
...or, uh, my underwear.

187
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,139
I'm listening.

188
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,017
See?

189
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,603
That is a great idea.

190
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:33,400
And I know Ugly Naked Guy because
we've been watching him for five years.

191
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:37,362
So that gives me back my edge. Ha, ha.

192
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,031
Let's see now. He had the trampoline.

193
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,534
- But he broke that.
- Well, he had gravity boots.

194
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,036
Yeah, he broke those too.

195
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,415
So he likes to break stuff.

196
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,879
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben,
but I will figure something out.

197
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,923
Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?

198
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,843
I wouldn't bring that up.
It would probably just bum him out.

199
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,929
Poor cat never saw that big butt coming.

200
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,058
Hello?

201
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,937
Oh, yeah, hey.
Hold on a second, she's right here.

202
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,230
It's Chandler.

203
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,982
Oh.

204
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,402
Hello, you.

205
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,947
Hello, Phoebe,
I've been thinking about you all day.

206
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,949
Huh?

207
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,912
Well, you know that thing you said before?
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.

208
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,497
Really?

209
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,332
Yeah. Listen, Joey won't be here tonight.

210
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:35,336
Why don't you come over
and I'll let you, uh, feel my bicep.

211
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,630
Or maybe more.

212
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,427
I'll have to get back to you on that.
Okay, bye.

213
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:48,099
Oh, my God. He wants me to come over
and feel his bicep and more.

214
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,435
- Are you kidding?
- No.

215
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,062
I cannot believe
he would do that to Mon...

216
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,616
Joey? Do they know that we know?

217
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,327
- No.
- Joey?

218
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,038
- They know you know.
- Ooh, I knew it.

219
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,291
Oh, I cannot believe those two.

220
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:17,253
They thought they could mess with us?
They're trying to mess with us?

221
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,675
They don't know that we know
they know we know.

222
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,304
And, Joey, you can't say anything.

223
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,431
Couldn't if I wanted to.

224
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,357
Good evening, sir.
My name is Ross Geller.

225
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,734
I'm one of the people
who applied for the apartment...

226
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:44,531
...and I realize that the competition
is fierce, but...

227
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,663
I'm sorry, I can't help but notice
that you're naked and...

228
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,251
I applaud you.

229
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,379
Man, I wish I was naked.

230
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,049
I mean, this looks so great.

231
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,052
That is how God intended it.

232
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,808
- Look at them. They're panicked.
- Oh, yeah, they're totally gonna back down.

233
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,476
Oh, yeah.

234
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,521
All right, if he wants a date,
he's going to get a date.

235
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,356
- I'm going to go in.
- Okay, okay.

236
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,024
Be sexy.

237
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,652
Please.

238
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,374
So, Chandler,
I'd love to come by tonight.

239
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,296
Really?

240
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,631
Oh, absolutely. Should we say around 7?

241
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,967
Yes.

242
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:52,056
Good. I'm really looking forward
to you and me having sexual intercourse.

243
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,608
Hey, hey, check it out, check it out.
Ugly Naked Guy's got a naked friend.

244
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,240
Oh, yeah.

245
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:14,037
Oh, my God. That's our friend.

246
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:18,207
- It's Naked Ross.
- It is Ross!

247
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,130
Showtime.

248
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,174
Okay, Rachel, get me perfume.

249
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,302
And, Joey, can you get me
a bottle of wine and glasses?

250
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,477
All right, it'll be great.

251
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,688
You just make her think you want to
have sex with her and it'll freak her out.

252
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,776
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna
have to go with her?

253
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,028
Relax, she's gonna give in
way before you do.

254
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,280
- How do you know?
- Because you're on my team.

255
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,616
And my team always wins.

256
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,994
At this?

257
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,081
Just go get some. Go.

258
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,335
Okay, honey, now,
I'm gonna try to listen from right here.

259
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,295
- Okay.
- Okay. Oh, wait.

260
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,214
- Good idea.
- Yeah.

261
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,342
- Don't give away the farm.
- Okay.

262
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,765
Phoebe.

263
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,769
- Chandler.
- Come on in.

264
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,355
I was going to.

265
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,694
Um, I brought some wine.
Would you like some?

266
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,153
Sure.

267
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,039
So here we are. Nervous?

268
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,708
Me? No. You?

269
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,918
No. I want this to happen.

270
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,213
So do I.

271
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,271
I'm going to put on some music.

272
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,606
Maybe... Maybe I'll dance for you.

273
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,128
You look good.

274
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,089
Thanks. Heh.

275
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,594
You know, when you say
things like that, it makes me wanna...

276
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:38,598
...rip that sweater vest right off.

277
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,393
Well, why don't we move this
into the bedroom?

278
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,772
- Really?
- Oh, do you not want to?

279
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,315
No. No.

280
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,651
I just, you know, first,
I wanna take off all my clothes...

281
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:54,113
...and have you rub lotion on me.

282
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,408
Well, that would be nice.

283
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,704
I'll go get the lotion.

284
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,795
This is totally getting out of hand, okay?
She wants me to put lotion on her.

285
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,714
- She's bluffing.
- Look, she's not backing down.

286
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,591
She went like this...

287
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,721
He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.

288
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,601
Oh, man, aren't you guys done yet?

289
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:26,104
I want to sit in my chair.

290
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,398
Joey, look at it this way,
the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler...

291
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,068
...the sooner this is all over
and out in the open.

292
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,611
Ooh, I like that.

293
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:38,699
Oh, okay. Show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.

294
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,035
Joey!

295
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,667
Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.

296
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,419
It's not my first time.

297
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,716
You go back out there
and you seduce her till she cracks.

298
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,385
Okay. Give me a second.

299
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,139
- Did you clean up in here?
- Of course.

300
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,312
Oh, you're, uh... You're going?

301
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,731
Um, not without you, lover.

302
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,990
So this is my bra.

303
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,954
It's very, very nice.

304
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,083
Well, come here.

305
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,295
I'm very happy
we're gonna have all the sex.

306
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,341
You should be. I'm very bendy.

307
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,474
- I'm gonna kiss you now.
- Not if I kiss you first.

308
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,664
Well, I guess there's nothing
left for us to do but kiss.

309
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,209
Here it comes.

310
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,003
Our first kiss.

311
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,473
Okay, okay, okay. You win.

312
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,558
- Ha!
- I can't have sex with you.

313
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,852
- And why not?
- Because I'm in love with Monica.

314
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,437
You're... You're what?

315
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,359
Love her. That's right. I love her.

316
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,153
I love her.

317
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,409
I love you, Monica.

318
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,329
I love you too, Chandler.

319
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,380
I just thought you guys were doing it.
I didn't know you were in love.

320
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,926
Dude.

321
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,930
Hats off to Phoebe.
Quite a competitor.

322
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,142
And may I say your breasts
are still showing?

323
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,602
God.

324
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,397
All right. So that's it?

325
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,315
It's over. Everybody knows.

326
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,067
Well, actually, Ross doesn't.

327
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,778
Yes, and we'd appreciate it
if no one told him yet.

328
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,580
A new place for a new Ross.

329
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,874
I'm gonna have you
and all the guys from work over...

330
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,584
...once it's, you know, furnished.

331
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,962
I must say, it's nice to see you
back on your feet.

332
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:42,174
Well, I am that, uh, and the whole
rage thing is definitely behind me.

333
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,553
I wonder if it's time for you
to rejoin our team at the museum.

334
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,179
Oh, Donald, that would be great.

335
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,725
I am totally ready to come back to work.
I...

336
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,186
What? No.

337
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,858
What are you doing?

338
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,571
Get off my sister!
