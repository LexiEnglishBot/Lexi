1
00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:04,482
Pick a card.

2
00:00:05,017 --> 00:00:07,577
All right. Now, memorize it.

3
00:00:07,953 --> 00:00:10,012
-You got it?
-Oh, yes.

4
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:11,917
ls that your card?

5
00:00:16,028 --> 00:00:17,461
Yes.

6
00:00:20,432 --> 00:00:22,764
-Hey, guys.
-Hi there!

7
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:27,532
Guess what.
Ben is gonna be in a TV commercial.

8
00:00:27,773 --> 00:00:29,570
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:31,367
lt's not for sure, but...

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,704
...we met this guy in the park
who thought Ben was cute.

11
00:00:34,947 --> 00:00:38,246
You know, which he is.
He gave us his card...

12
00:00:38,417 --> 00:00:41,818
...and told us to bring him
for this commercial he's auditioning.

13
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:46,653
This guy's the biggest commercial
casting director in town!

14
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,658
Ben takes one lousy walk
in the park and gets an audition?

15
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:55,963
l mean, way to go, Ben!

16
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,163
l've been in that park a million times
and no one's offered me an audition.

17
00:01:02,374 --> 00:01:04,934
lt's crazy. We were pushing
Ben on the swings--

18
00:01:05,143 --> 00:01:07,805
l'm always on the swings!

19
00:01:08,714 --> 00:01:10,375
What am l doing wrong?

20
00:01:11,216 --> 00:01:12,205
That.

21
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:16,680
The One Where Rachel Smokes

22
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:04,764
-Gotta go. Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

23
00:02:05,037 --> 00:02:08,234
Since you work at Ralph Lauren,
can you get me some shirts?

24
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,537
l don't know if l'd feel comfortable
stealing on my very first day.

25
00:02:14,446 --> 00:02:16,710
Unwilling to steal from work.

26
00:02:16,915 --> 00:02:18,212
lnteresting.

27
00:02:18,717 --> 00:02:21,083
lf anybody gets free stuff,
it's me.

28
00:02:21,286 --> 00:02:23,618
Okay, guys, way to wish me luck.

29
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:25,478
Go get 'em!

30
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:28,586
Let's discuss Rachel's birthday.

31
00:02:28,794 --> 00:02:31,058
l say we throw
a surprise party this weekend.

32
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,594
But her birthday's
not for another month.

33
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:37,064
lf we throw her party on her birthday,
it's not a surprise.

34
00:02:38,837 --> 00:02:42,432
Great! We can have a dinner party
and just invite her close friends.

35
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:45,802
Ross! We're having
a surprise party for Rachel.

36
00:02:46,344 --> 00:02:47,436
Done.

37
00:02:49,414 --> 00:02:51,314
Great. Wanna do it together?

38
00:02:51,616 --> 00:02:53,311
l'd love to do it together!

39
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:59,580
They're gonna do it together.

40
00:03:00,192 --> 00:03:01,489
That's my girlfriend.

41
00:03:01,693 --> 00:03:03,354
So l gotta shut it down now?

42
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:07,958
l gotta go.
l'm picking up Ben...

43
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,532
...and then we're off
to the big audition.

44
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:14,294
lt's gonna be weird seeing some actor
pretending to be Ben's dad.

45
00:03:14,506 --> 00:03:16,531
Weirder than seeing his two moms make out?

46
00:03:18,844 --> 00:03:21,176
Dad? There's a dad
in the commercial?

47
00:03:21,446 --> 00:03:24,677
Yeah. The dad and Ben eat soup
and pretend to enjoy it.

48
00:03:24,883 --> 00:03:27,681
Maybe l'll go with you
and audition as the dad.

49
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:30,320
Who better to play Ben's father
than his godfather?

50
00:03:30,622 --> 00:03:33,056
-You're not his godfather.
-What?

51
00:03:34,392 --> 00:03:35,825
Are you kidding?

52
00:03:37,863 --> 00:03:38,955
Of course l am.

53
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:43,968
-Okay, let's go, godfather.
-All right!

54
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,409
They're gonna let me audition!

55
00:03:53,578 --> 00:03:55,011
Really? That's great!

56
00:03:55,213 --> 00:03:58,774
One of the casting ladies
has actually seen me in a play.

57
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,577
So l steered clear of her.

58
00:04:00,752 --> 00:04:02,743
And the other one, l know from....

59
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:04,855
Well, you know.

60
00:04:06,758 --> 00:04:08,749
-That kid looks familiar.
-Oh, yeah.

61
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,862
He's done tons of commercials.
l've seen him in Sugar Smacks, PlayStation...

62
00:04:13,131 --> 00:04:14,860
...and that one
for the phone company.

63
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,002
He was so good, he convinced me
to switch phone companies.

64
00:04:19,304 --> 00:04:21,966
Chandler was mad.

65
00:04:22,474 --> 00:04:26,103
He's not gonna get this one.
Ben is way cuter than that kid.

66
00:04:26,344 --> 00:04:27,538
l mean, look at him.

67
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,508
That's great.

68
00:04:35,787 --> 00:04:38,620
Wouldn't it be great
if l got to play Ben's dad?

69
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:40,223
You look nothing like Ben.

70
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:44,058
l look more like him than you do.

71
00:04:46,298 --> 00:04:49,665
l really don't know you
well enough for you to do that.

72
00:04:54,673 --> 00:04:58,575
So it's down to these two.
Nancy, l know you like this one.

73
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,404
l think l agree.
Rachel, what do you think?

74
00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:04,046
Well, that one is pretty...

75
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:06,740
...but l just love this fabric.

76
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:07,907
Sorry.

77
00:05:08,086 --> 00:05:10,987
Don't be. Part of your job
is to give your opinions.

78
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:13,316
Then l take credit for them.
l'm kidding!

79
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:17,424
She is kidding. But don't ever
disagree with her again.

80
00:05:17,662 --> 00:05:19,527
Okay, now l'm kidding!

81
00:05:19,764 --> 00:05:21,994
What a fun office.

82
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:26,602
l don't know which one.
But l do know l need a cigarette.

83
00:05:26,838 --> 00:05:30,535
Let's take a break, go outside
and sort this out when we return.

84
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,206
-You smoke?
-No.

85
00:05:36,414 --> 00:05:40,214
My dad's a doctor. And he would
always tell me horror stories....

86
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:46,387
About ghosts and goblins...

87
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:51,455
...who totally supported
the princess' right to smoke.

88
00:05:57,602 --> 00:06:01,629
And then they came back from smoking
and they'd made all of the decisions.

89
00:06:01,873 --> 00:06:03,397
-That's not fair.
-l know.

90
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:07,271
lt's like l'm being punished for not having
this disgusting, poisonous habit.

91
00:06:07,545 --> 00:06:09,274
Yeah, it is the best.

92
00:06:10,882 --> 00:06:12,474
What if this keeps happening?

93
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:14,981
They'll be smoking,
making the decisions...

94
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,554
...and l'll be up in my office
breathing in my stupid clean air.

95
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,225
And when Kim wants
to promote one of us...

96
00:06:22,427 --> 00:06:25,794
...who do you think she'll pick?
Me or Smokey Smokerson?

97
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:27,997
We used to have
a smoking area at work.

98
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,726
lt was great. There was this
big flowerpot with dirt in it.

99
00:06:30,902 --> 00:06:33,097
We used to put our cigarettes out in it.

100
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:36,263
One of the old-timers told me
there used to be a little tree in there.

101
00:06:38,043 --> 00:06:42,571
You can go down there and not smoke.
Say you want some fresh air.

102
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:45,749
l could do that.

103
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:48,351
Or you could do
the easy thing and smoke.

104
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:52,390
You gotta take long, deep drags.

105
00:06:55,694 --> 00:06:59,152
Wow, l still don't have
my lung capacity back yet.

106
00:07:00,498 --> 00:07:02,159
Rach, do you wanna go get coffee?

107
00:07:02,434 --> 00:07:04,334
-l would love to.
-Oh, good.

108
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:05,798
l'm gonna go too.

109
00:07:06,004 --> 00:07:07,130
Oh, good.

110
00:07:09,307 --> 00:07:11,104
Oh, l changed my mind.

111
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:17,376
Let's talk about the party.
l have so many ideas.

112
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:19,048
Me too!

113
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:22,179
Oh, look at that.

114
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:27,355
This is a little sketch
of the cake. See?

115
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,183
Some sample menus.

116
00:07:29,394 --> 00:07:32,329
l thought we'd start with
a Tuscan-style finger food.

117
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,532
And for music, here's an
alphabetized list of all of my CDs.

118
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:39,895
l've highlighted the ones
that'll go with the food.

119
00:07:40,438 --> 00:07:43,236
-What about the intimate dinner party?
-We're not doing that.

120
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:49,874
Looks like you took care of
everything. Thanks a lot, cohost.

121
00:07:50,482 --> 00:07:53,883
Wait a minute. There's plenty
of things for you to do.

122
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:55,883
Like what?

123
00:07:56,921 --> 00:07:57,910
Cups.

124
00:07:59,424 --> 00:08:00,891
You're giving me cups?

125
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,749
And ice.

126
00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:07,393
Cups and ice? l get to be
in charge of cups and ice?

127
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,089
All right.

128
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:12,828
Fine. l will be
in charge of cups and ice.

129
00:08:13,171 --> 00:08:15,332
-l can get ice at the restaurant--
-l got it!

130
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:22,603
-How did the audition go?
-Not so good.

131
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:26,578
Wait a minute.
Are you doing Joey's:

132
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:30,787
''The audition didn't go so well....
Yeah, it did''?

133
00:08:32,557 --> 00:08:33,546
Yeah, l am!

134
00:08:36,294 --> 00:08:38,888
-Yeah, Ben got a second audition.
-That's great!

135
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,965
l had to teach Ross my bit because
l actually didn't get a callback.

136
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:47,034
You got a callback too, didn't you?

137
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:50,964
Yeah, l did!

138
00:08:57,048 --> 00:08:58,640
What are you doing out here?

139
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,148
lt got kind of lonely up there,
so l thought l would come out here...

140
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:05,389
...and get some fresh air.

141
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:07,922
We're discussing the fall collection.

142
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:09,115
Oh, great.

143
00:09:09,294 --> 00:09:10,386
Anyway, we really--

144
00:09:10,895 --> 00:09:13,796
-Sorry. We're smoking all over you.
-That's okay.

145
00:09:13,998 --> 00:09:15,625
We'll move. You stay there.

146
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:19,561
l sent the designs to Ralph.
He was excited about it.

147
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:22,170
That's great!
You are the best!

148
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:25,501
Excuse me.
Can l bum one of those?

149
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:27,108
Actually, this one's....

150
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:32,476
What's so funny over here?

151
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:34,716
l thought you didn't smoke.

152
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:39,583
You know, l thought you guys
meant marijuana cigarettes.

153
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:42,753
You know what l mean?
Doobies?

154
00:09:44,863 --> 00:09:47,957
Actually, l thought to myself,
''Those guys are crazy!''

155
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:50,690
But no, l smoke the
regular ones all the time.

156
00:09:51,703 --> 00:09:52,795
We get high.

157
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,101
Me too.

158
00:09:58,543 --> 00:09:59,805
l'm kidding.

159
00:10:00,812 --> 00:10:02,507
Me too.

160
00:10:05,216 --> 00:10:08,777
Oh, God! This is so nerve-racking.
How do you do this?

161
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:12,113
Fortunately, l don't get
many callbacks, so....

162
00:10:12,857 --> 00:10:15,519
ls it a good sign that
they asked us to wait?

163
00:10:15,827 --> 00:10:17,351
Who knows?

164
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:24,295
We have narrowed it down
to Raymond, Ben, Kyle...

165
00:10:24,536 --> 00:10:26,800
...and Joey.
The rest of you, thank you.

166
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:29,200
Yes! l knew it!

167
00:10:30,742 --> 00:10:32,209
Bye-bye.

168
00:10:33,178 --> 00:10:35,237
So long.

169
00:10:35,914 --> 00:10:37,211
Later.

170
00:10:37,382 --> 00:10:42,319
l'm not married to him anymore.
He's my ex-husband. l'm totally gay!

171
00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:45,854
This is great!
l might get to play Ben's dad.

172
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:47,514
Actually, that can't happen.

173
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:49,784
Because you have
such different looks...

174
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:52,963
...we're putting you with Raymond
and Kyle with Ben.

175
00:10:53,198 --> 00:10:55,826
So it'll either be
you two or you two.

176
00:11:00,038 --> 00:11:02,802
-This is gonna be kind of weird.
-Yeah, it is.

177
00:11:03,341 --> 00:11:05,809
Yeah. lt's gonna be weird.

178
00:11:07,812 --> 00:11:11,407
No. We're like best friends.
That's why it's weird.

179
00:11:13,151 --> 00:11:15,415
l thought we were just talking.

180
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:27,094
lf Ben gets this commercial, do you
think you can get me some free soup?

181
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,197
Chandler, a can of soup is like 60 cents.

182
00:11:30,368 --> 00:11:34,429
Yeah, okay, but l have been supporting
a 29-year-old ltalian for five years.

183
00:11:37,008 --> 00:11:40,500
ls it okay if l leave this here
till Rachel's birthday party?

184
00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:43,645
-Sure. What's in them?
-Cups.

185
00:11:44,582 --> 00:11:47,847
Good, because we got Rachel
800 gallons of water.

186
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:50,986
That's a lot of cups.

187
00:11:51,189 --> 00:11:53,521
l'm in charge of cups and ice.

188
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:57,149
And Monica's gonna rue the day
she put me in charge of cups and ice.

189
00:11:58,963 --> 00:12:02,763
You know, l rued the day once.
Didn't get a whole lot else done.

190
00:12:04,002 --> 00:12:07,028
Okay, time to bring up
the rest of the cups.

191
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,678
Ross, l'm glad you're here.

192
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,212
-l want to talk to you.
-What's up?

193
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,045
l've been thinking about this
commercial thing. Me against Ben.

194
00:12:23,288 --> 00:12:27,657
The two of us competing.
That can't lead to anything good.

195
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,690
l think l'm just gonna step aside.
l'll tell them that l won't audition.

196
00:12:36,301 --> 00:12:38,963
Joey, that's great.
Thanks, man.

197
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:44,864
That's it?

198
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:50,178
You're gonna let me do this?
lt's my career we're talking about!

199
00:12:50,348 --> 00:12:51,337
But you just--

200
00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:54,144
l just said that
so you wouldn't let Ben do it.

201
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:57,587
lf anyone should step aside,
it should be Ben.

202
00:12:57,822 --> 00:12:59,414
-What?
-Chandler, tell him!

203
00:13:02,427 --> 00:13:04,861
Well, let me get the door first.

204
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:08,528
Hi, no one!

205
00:13:11,936 --> 00:13:13,699
Why should Ben step aside?

206
00:13:13,905 --> 00:13:17,341
lt was his audition in the
first place. You tagged along.

207
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:20,067
You're like the tagalong dad!

208
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:21,939
At least l care about his feelings.

209
00:13:22,513 --> 00:13:23,502
What?

210
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:26,548
You know how hard it'll be on him
when he doesn't get it?

211
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:28,919
And why wouldn't he get it?

212
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,919
Come on!

213
00:13:31,255 --> 00:13:33,951
Have you seen what my kid can do?

214
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,587
He dials phones,
he eats tortilla chips.

215
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:40,888
He plays soccer
with the cartoon tiger!

216
00:13:41,366 --> 00:13:45,063
Are you saying your kid eats soup
better than my kid?

217
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:47,965
You just give him a spoon, baby.

218
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:50,571
Oh, yeah? l guess we'll see!

219
00:13:50,775 --> 00:13:52,766
This commercial belongs
to me and Mitch!

220
00:13:53,044 --> 00:13:56,480
-Your kid's name is Raymond!
-Yeah? So is yours!

221
00:14:01,786 --> 00:14:03,811
-How did work go?
-lt was great.

222
00:14:04,055 --> 00:14:07,149
l went down there like you said.
And we talked business.

223
00:14:07,392 --> 00:14:08,916
And Kim took my opinions.

224
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,722
You stink!

225
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,962
-Thanks.
-No, l'm serious.

226
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,634
That's because l went down there
and they were smoking.

227
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:20,293
This is actually the smell of success.

228
00:14:21,172 --> 00:14:23,163
But there's something different--

229
00:14:23,474 --> 00:14:25,101
Oh, my God! You smoked!

230
00:14:26,577 --> 00:14:27,566
l did not.

231
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:31,078
Yes, you did. You look
happy and sick. You smoked!

232
00:14:31,816 --> 00:14:35,252
All right, fine! But l had to.
l had to do it for my career.

233
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:38,255
l wish l had to smoke for my career.

234
00:14:39,357 --> 00:14:41,188
But it's so gross!

235
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:43,189
lt's not that bad, you know?

236
00:14:43,494 --> 00:14:48,454
Yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy
and my fingers sort of smell.

237
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:51,133
l actually feel like l could throw up.

238
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:54,200
-Can you hear yourself?
-l know. l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

239
00:14:54,372 --> 00:14:57,034
l'm not myself.
l smoked like half a pack.

240
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,006
l feel a little shaky and a little weird.

241
00:15:00,178 --> 00:15:04,945
But you gotta push past this, okay?
Because it's about to get so good.

242
00:15:07,952 --> 00:15:10,682
You smell so smoky,
l gotta get up.

243
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:12,688
l'm not kidding.

244
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,020
l think you smell great.

245
00:15:20,665 --> 00:15:23,327
So we're decided.
No on plaid, yes on pink.

246
00:15:23,568 --> 00:15:25,160
Absolutely.

247
00:15:25,369 --> 00:15:27,462
l'm so onboard.

248
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:32,075
-Didn't you just light that?
-Yeah.

249
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,470
But you know what?

250
00:15:33,678 --> 00:15:37,239
l'm just really, really
trying to cut back, you know.

251
00:15:37,548 --> 00:15:39,140
Good luck, Rach.

252
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:43,150
l've been thinking about quitting.

253
00:15:43,488 --> 00:15:45,922
Every Sunday night,
l tell myself l'm quitting.

254
00:15:46,123 --> 00:15:48,148
Every Monday morning, it's like:

255
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:49,517
Tell me about it.

256
00:15:49,794 --> 00:15:52,490
We'll just quit.
Let's all quit!

257
00:15:52,897 --> 00:15:54,023
lt sounds appealing.

258
00:15:54,232 --> 00:15:56,962
-l never could do it.
-But you could. Absolutely.

259
00:15:57,201 --> 00:16:00,136
We can help each other.
We could get those patches.

260
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:02,704
We could be like the Patch Sisters.

261
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:06,399
You know, we really should quit.
Okay, let's quit!

262
00:16:06,677 --> 00:16:08,736
Great! Give me those cigs.
Come on!

263
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,073
Give it! Out. Done. Quit.

264
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:16,212
My late husband gave me that lighter.

265
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:19,488
l'm not kidding.

266
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:21,681
Okay, then.

267
00:16:24,362 --> 00:16:26,421
Mmm...soup.

268
00:16:27,498 --> 00:16:29,557
Mmm...soup.

269
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:38,232
Would you mind watching Ben for me
while l use the ladies' room?

270
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:39,602
-No problem.
-Thanks.

271
00:16:52,723 --> 00:16:56,454
So you want to be an actor?
l gotta tell you, it's no picnic.

272
00:16:56,761 --> 00:17:00,060
There's tons of rejection.
No stability.

273
00:17:00,264 --> 00:17:03,961
l mean, one day,
you're Dr. Drake Ramoray.

274
00:17:04,435 --> 00:17:07,700
The next day, you're eating
ketchup out of the bottle.

275
00:17:07,872 --> 00:17:11,808
lt's a tough life. l mean, sure,
you can get up whenever you want...

276
00:17:11,976 --> 00:17:14,069
...watch TV all day...

277
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:17,612
...meet tons of women in acting class....

278
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:22,108
Oh, who am l kidding. l can't
talk you out of this. lt's a great life.

279
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:28,020
-Joey.
-Ross.

280
00:17:30,194 --> 00:17:31,491
Ben.

281
00:17:32,263 --> 00:17:34,128
l mean, Ben. Ben.

282
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:37,191
Raymond, Joey, you're up.

283
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:44,470
So here's what....

284
00:17:44,642 --> 00:17:47,475
Are you sure that l haven't seen you
somewhere before?

285
00:17:47,645 --> 00:17:50,478
No, l haven't been in any plays.

286
00:17:51,248 --> 00:17:54,547
All right, let's try one.
Whenever you guys are ready.

287
00:17:57,288 --> 00:17:58,312
ls there a problem?

288
00:17:58,522 --> 00:18:02,219
Well, this is noodle soup.
And l've been working with tomato.

289
00:18:02,893 --> 00:18:04,986
But that's okay. No problem.

290
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:07,323
Mmm...noodle soup.

291
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:10,898
You know, that's fine.
But the line is, ''Mmm...soup.''

292
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:13,994
-What'd l say?
-''Mmm...noodle soup.''

293
00:18:16,407 --> 00:18:17,396
How's that different?

294
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:26,381
All right. Let's try one.

295
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,978
Mmm...

296
00:18:31,188 --> 00:18:33,156
...noodle soup.

297
00:18:37,161 --> 00:18:38,492
Let's do it again.

298
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,830
Mmm...soup.

299
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:47,003
l mean, noodle soup.
l mean, soup!

300
00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:48,160
Come on!

301
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:53,169
You know what?
We need to move on.

302
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:55,536
No, l could do it one more time.

303
00:18:55,746 --> 00:18:56,770
Look.

304
00:18:57,081 --> 00:18:59,242
Mmm...noodle soup.

305
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,781
Damn it!

306
00:19:04,488 --> 00:19:08,185
So l think that if we get these samples
into the magazine by Monday, we'll be fine.

307
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,884
Sounds good.
So, Rach, how you doing?

308
00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:13,690
-l'm great!
-No, with the not-smoking thing.

309
00:19:15,332 --> 00:19:17,630
Kill me now.

310
00:19:17,802 --> 00:19:21,397
Let me tell you something,
l ate 40 Mallomars today.

311
00:19:21,572 --> 00:19:25,099
l mean, l have patches
all over my body, you know?

312
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:28,439
-l mean, l haven't slept in two days.
-We quit yesterday.

313
00:19:29,947 --> 00:19:32,108
That's counting today.

314
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:35,618
But anyway, so these samples, l think--

315
00:19:35,786 --> 00:19:37,219
Oh, my God!

316
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:41,848
l'm so sorry, l forgot. l have to go
to the mailroom and mail some proofs.

317
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:45,325
Go ahead. Rachel and l will just sit here
and keep brainstorming.

318
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:49,089
Also, <i>Vogue</i> called.
And they were wondering--

319
00:19:49,266 --> 00:19:53,100
You know what? l'm a little hungry. l'm just
gonna run down to the vending machines.

320
00:19:53,904 --> 00:19:55,701
All right.

321
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:06,040
Busted!

322
00:20:07,017 --> 00:20:11,351
Come on! What are you doing?
l thought we were the Patch Sisters.

323
00:20:11,589 --> 00:20:13,181
That didn't work out.

324
00:20:13,624 --> 00:20:15,683
Wait a minute.
What about all we've talked about?

325
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,227
You know, the disgusting place,
the ugly people.

326
00:20:22,032 --> 00:20:24,227
Hey, how you doing?

327
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:29,766
We tried to quit.
But it was too hard.

328
00:20:30,007 --> 00:20:33,408
lf you started smoking again,
you could have at least told me.

329
00:20:33,677 --> 00:20:36,168
Give me one.
What are we talking about?

330
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:37,778
Don't you give up.

331
00:20:38,048 --> 00:20:40,949
That's why we didn't tell you,
and we won't drag you down.

332
00:20:41,185 --> 00:20:43,210
Wait. No, no.
Drag me down.

333
00:20:43,454 --> 00:20:46,218
Forget it. We're so proud
of how well you're doing.

334
00:20:46,457 --> 00:20:49,620
l won't let you blow it.
lf l catch you, you're fired.

335
00:20:49,894 --> 00:20:53,625
Go on, get out of here.
l don't want you breathing this stuff.

336
00:20:53,898 --> 00:20:56,765
So, okay. You'll come with me
on the Paris trip?

337
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:58,798
Oh, man!

338
00:21:03,474 --> 00:21:07,069
Check it out.
Cup hat, cup banner...

339
00:21:07,278 --> 00:21:11,112
...cup chandelier, and the thing
that started it all: the cup!

340
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:13,477
Great job with the cups.

341
00:21:15,486 --> 00:21:17,579
Why don't you just go out with her?

342
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:21,420
Did you notice the ice? Look!

343
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:26,119
We have it all. We have crushed,
cubed and dry. Watch.

344
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:30,097
Mystical.

345
00:21:35,172 --> 00:21:38,471
No one's eating my food.
They're eating her snow cones!

346
00:21:38,742 --> 00:21:40,573
There are snow cones?

347
00:21:43,948 --> 00:21:45,313
-Go, go!
-Thank you.

348
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:53,615
-You really did do a nice job.
-Thank you...

349
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,691
...for stating the obvious.

350
00:21:56,794 --> 00:21:58,659
l deserve that.

351
00:21:58,829 --> 00:22:02,560
l just want you to know that if we ever
cohost a party together again...

352
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:05,725
-...you can do whatever you want.
-Joey's got a birthday coming up.

353
00:22:05,903 --> 00:22:09,999
-Really? What do you wanna do?
-Okay, l'd like to be in charge of beer.

354
00:22:10,174 --> 00:22:12,642
Well, then there's nothing left for me.

355
00:22:14,511 --> 00:22:17,639
-Look, look!
-Surprise!

356
00:22:17,848 --> 00:22:21,511
What? My birthday is not
for another month.

357
00:22:21,886 --> 00:22:24,047
That's the surprise.

358
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:29,185
Oh, my God, you guys!
This is so great! lt's so unexpected.

359
00:22:29,393 --> 00:22:32,658
l mean, Chandler's birthday
is even before mine.

360
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:37,894
Surprise!

361
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:44,732
This is so great!
Look at all these...

362
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:45,898
...cups.

363
00:22:46,076 --> 00:22:48,044
This is so weird.

364
00:22:48,545 --> 00:22:50,410
l was in charge of cups.

365
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:52,672
Oh, okay. Not so weird.

366
00:22:54,151 --> 00:22:58,019
-Chandler, what are you doing?
-Nothing.

367
00:22:59,123 --> 00:23:02,991
-What's in your hand?
-Money. l'm stealing all the money.

368
00:23:03,928 --> 00:23:05,828
Chandler.

369
00:23:08,165 --> 00:23:11,828
But just one, okay? Because nobody
knows when my birthday is.

370
00:23:12,403 --> 00:23:14,098
Let me make this clear to you, okay?

371
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:15,863
lt's either that...

372
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,769
...or this.

373
00:23:24,248 --> 00:23:26,239
They were menthol.

374
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:37,422
Listen, man. l'm sorry
the audition didn't go well.

375
00:23:37,995 --> 00:23:38,984
Yeah, right.

376
00:23:39,763 --> 00:23:42,459
No, really. l am, Joey.
l feel bad.

377
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:45,794
Look, Ross.
You don't have to, okay?

378
00:23:46,437 --> 00:23:48,132
lt's not your fault l suck.

379
00:23:48,339 --> 00:23:51,968
What kind of an actor can't even say,
''Mmm...noodle soup''?

380
00:23:56,647 --> 00:24:01,346
You know what? Maybe you didn't
mess up your audition because you suck.

381
00:24:01,652 --> 00:24:06,612
Maybe you messed up because
you care more about your godson.

382
00:24:07,124 --> 00:24:08,113
What do you mean?

383
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:10,616
l think, subconsciously--

384
00:24:10,828 --> 00:24:12,386
You lost me.

385
00:24:16,734 --> 00:24:20,670
l think, on some level,
you sabotaged...

386
00:24:20,971 --> 00:24:24,964
...your own audition
so Ben would get the part.

387
00:24:27,811 --> 00:24:30,143
Your way sounds
a lot better than mine.

388
00:24:33,017 --> 00:24:34,712
lt's not that l'm a bad actor.

389
00:24:35,686 --> 00:24:39,679
No, it's just that l care
so damn much about little Ben...

390
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:43,189
...that it was more important
for me to see him succeed.

391
00:24:43,427 --> 00:24:45,918
-There you go. Thank you.
-Thank you.

392
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,027
-So did he get it?
-No.

393
00:24:48,232 --> 00:24:49,529
What are you gonna do?

394
00:24:54,805 --> 00:24:58,104
ls Rachel Green here?
l'm meeting her for lunch.

395
00:24:58,308 --> 00:25:01,277
She doesn't come down anymore.
You'll find her on 1 0.

396
00:25:01,478 --> 00:25:02,968
Okay, great.

397
00:25:03,714 --> 00:25:05,909
So we talked
about the presentation.

398
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,812
He wondered if one person
would be enough.

399
00:25:09,053 --> 00:25:11,248
And l said, ''Yeah, absolutely.''

400
00:25:16,827 --> 00:25:18,192
l'll catch you guys later.
