1
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:04,378
Oh. Mm.

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:05,629
- Hi.
- Hey.

3
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,173
You have got to try this cheesecake.

4
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,426
Oh, you know,
I'm not that much of a sweet tooth...

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,638
- Oh, my God, it's so creamy.
- Oh.

6
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:18,350
Oh, my God. That's the best
cheesecake I've ever had.

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,893
Where did you get this?

8
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:24,523
It was at the front door when I got home.
Somebody sent it to us.

9
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,818
Chandler, this isn't addressed to you.

10
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,070
This is addressed
to Mrs. Braverman downstairs.

11
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,448
Thief.

12
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,493
I didn't read the box before I opened it...

13
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,704
...and you can't return a box
after you opened it.

14
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,957
- Why not?
- Because it's too delicious.

15
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,336
Chandler, you stole this cheesecake.
That is wrong.

16
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,297
No, no, no, it is going to be okay...

17
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,258
...because Mrs. Braverman
is gonna send away for a free one.

18
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,052
And that way, we all win.

19
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,431
The only losers are the
big cheesecake conglomerate:

20
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,017
"Mama's Little Bakery."

21
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,728
I feel terrible.

22
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,230
I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.

23
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,442
Well, I'm sorry, what?

24
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,860
I should get going. Big day at work.

25
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,196
You know how I'm in a coma?

26
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:58,325
Today they do a test on me and it
turns out I'm not brain-dead.

27
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,452
So...

28
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,204
Ah-ah, Mr. Smarty-Pants.

29
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,832
It's just my character
that's not brain-dead.

30
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,835
Pheebs, still on for tonight?

31
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,629
- Absolutely. Okay.
- All right, I'll see you at 8.

32
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,172
Oh, what's at 8?

33
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,924
Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey.

34
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,177
We get together about once
a month to discuss the rest of you guys.

35
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,764
Wow. Did not know that.

36
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,475
May I say how lovely you look today?

37
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,227
Duly noted.

38
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,563
Oh, so for tomorrow...

39
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,190
...do you want to rent a car
and drive down together or what?

40
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:31,859
What are you talking about?

41
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,027
Cousin Frannie's wedding.
It's tomorrow night.

42
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,489
You were invited?

43
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,534
No.

44
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,786
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.

45
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,289
I knew Mom and Dad were invited.
I thought that was it.

46
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:49,710
I mean, from the ages of 7 to 9,
Frannie and I were inseparable.

47
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,714
Well, maybe since the age of 9,
Frannie's made some new friends.

48
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:58,760
Look, it's probably just a mistake.
Let me call Aunt Cheryl, okay?

49
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:02,097
Maybe you are invited and the invitation
just got lost in the mail.

50
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,475
Yeah, well, you call her and tell her
that, you know, when we were kids...

51
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:09,021
...her precious little Frannie
tried to undress me several times, okay?

52
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,566
If I hadn't stopped her, there probably
wouldn't be a wedding to go to.

53
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,861
She tried to undress me too.

54
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,072
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.

55
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:30,375
Joseph Francis Tribbiani,
are you home yet?

56
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,586
Um, I think he's still out.
What's wrong?

57
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,379
Well, I'll tell you, Rachel Karen Green.

58
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,342
I had plans with Joey tonight,
and he left me this note.

59
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:42,262
"Pheebs, can't make it.
Got a date. Talk to you later.

60
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,139
Big Daddy."

61
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:48,060
- "Big Daddy"?
- Oh, that's a nickname we were trying out.

62
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,522
Hey, you know what nickname
never caught on? "The Ross-a-tron."

63
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,195
- Hey.
- Oh, here's Joseph Francis.

64
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,907
Whoa, what are you
middle-naming me for?

65
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,408
I left you a note.

66
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,953
So what? That doesn't give you
the right to ditch me.

67
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,332
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends
if there's a possibility for sex.

68
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,292
Phoebe, he's right. That is the rule.

69
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,752
I don't accept this rule.

70
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,338
When we make plans,
I expect you to show up.

71
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,758
Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time
till you meet someone better.

72
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:24,638
You know, boyfriends and girlfriends
are gonna come and go, but this is for life.

73
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,976
Wow. I'm so sorry. I had no idea
it would bother you this much.

74
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,519
Well, it does.

75
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,230
Okay, can I make it up to you? Huh?

76
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,648
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,443
How about dinner tomorrow night?
I'll pay for myself.

78
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,948
Okay, you wore me down.

79
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,787
Joe, while you're over there, how about
another beer for "The Ross-a-tron"?

80
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,957
"Ross..." Is that back?

81
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,715
- Hi.
- The other cheesecake came.

82
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,134
They delivered it
to the wrong address again.

83
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,971
So just bring it back downstairs.
What's the problem?

84
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,598
I can't seem to say goodbye.

85
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:12,019
Are you serious? Chandler,
we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago...

86
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,228
...and you want more?

87
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,106
Well, I've forgotten
what it tastes like, okay?

88
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,234
It was cheesecake. It was fine.

89
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:23,530
It had a buttery, crumbly,
graham-cracker crust...

90
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,074
...with a very rich...

91
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:30,370
...yet light cream-cheese filling.

92
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,876
Wow, my whole mouth
just filled with saliva. Ahem.

93
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,129
Know what? Forget it.
We are just hungry.

94
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,840
We have not had lunch.
We are just lightheaded.

95
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,594
So let us go out and have lunch
and forget about the cheesecake.

96
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,888
We'll drop it off downstairs
so we're not tempted.

97
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,473
Where do you wanna go to lunch?

98
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,308
Mama's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.

99
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,646
Aw.

100
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,191
Mel Tormé died.

101
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,818
Joey, that paper's like a year old.

102
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:05,447
Oh, does that mean
the Sam Goody's sale is over?

103
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,575
- Hey.
- Hey.

104
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,745
So I finally heard back
from Aunt Cheryl...

105
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,331
...and apparently it wasn't a mistake.

106
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,541
Uh, there's limited seating in the hall...

107
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:21,588
Limited seating?
I am just one tiny person.

108
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,383
Yeah, but she doesn't know that.

109
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,219
I mean, the last time she saw you...

110
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,264
...you would've turned one of those
little wedding chairs into kindling.

111
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,478
"Limited seating."
That's such a lame excuse.

112
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,730
That's not the reason
why she's not inviting me.

113
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,984
What's the big deal? I wasn't even invited
to the ceremony, just the reception.

114
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,195
And you know what?
If it makes you feel any better...

115
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,322
...Joan and I will just
make an appearance...

116
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,826
...and then we'll leave early
as a sign of protest.

117
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,578
- Joan?
- Yeah, Joan Tedeschi, my date.

118
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,289
She's an assistant professor
in the Linguistics Department.

119
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,791
Tall, very beautiful.

120
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,337
And despite what some people say,
not broad-backed.

121
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,675
Wait a minute.
You got "Ross Geller and guest"?

122
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,969
I wasn't invited,
and you got "and guest"?

123
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:12,806
Uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt
on Ross' behalf.

124
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,850
I think the rule applies here.

125
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,977
Since he has a chance
to get on broad-back...

126
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,395
Not broad-back!

127
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,524
Wait a minute. You're bringing me.

128
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,359
What? I can't cancel on Joan.

129
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,778
- Why not?
- Did you not hear me?

130
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,615
She's an assistant professor
in the Linguistics Department, okay?

131
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,701
They're wild.

132
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,788
- Why do you want to come anyway?
- Because...

133
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,665
...she's my cousin.

134
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,835
I mean, we grew up together.

135
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,547
Family, you know?
And all that's important to me.

136
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,342
Okay, all right. I'll take you.

137
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,719
I'll go call Joan.

138
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,680
Oh, that's nice.

139
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,682
Family should be there.

140
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,101
This is her wedding.
Happiest day of her life.

141
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,895
We'll see. Ha, ha.

142
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,902
Well, thank you for lunch.

143
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,070
Wait a minute, I didn't pay.
I thought you paid.

144
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,907
So apparently,
we just don't pay for food anymore.

145
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,829
- Do you see what I see?
- Huh! It's still there.

146
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,082
Mrs. Braverman must be out.

147
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,797
She could be out of town.
Maybe she'll be gone for months.

148
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,841
By then, the cheesecake
may have gone bad.

149
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,927
We don't want her to come back
to bad cheesecake.

150
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,762
- That could kill her.
- Wouldn't want that.

151
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,013
No, we're protecting her.

152
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,681
- We should take it.
- But move quick.

153
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,767
- Why?
- I heard her moving around in there.

154
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,310
Go, go, go.

155
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,234
Oh, my God, that's David.

156
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,402
- Who?
- David, the scientist guy.

157
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,071
David that I was in love with.

158
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,324
David who went to Russia
and broke my heart, David.

159
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,700
Oh, my God.

160
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,078
Oh, you say someone's name enough,
they turn around.

161
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,708
- Phoebe.
- David.

162
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,464
What are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?

163
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,008
Yeah, I'm just in town for a conference.

164
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,303
Um, God, you look phenomenal.

165
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,972
Well, ha, ha...

166
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,473
Yeah.

167
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:22,018
You look great too.
Did you get a haircut?

168
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,771
Yeah. Well, I got like 30 of them.

169
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,273
Yeah.

170
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,692
- Um, look, I got a confession to make.
- Uh-huh.

171
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,236
Um, I was hoping to run into you here.

172
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,948
I didn't know that I should call or not.
You know, I was only in town a few days...

173
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,867
...and, you know, I didn't want
to intrude on your life or anything.

174
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,036
But I really wanted to see you...

175
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:43,081
...but I didn't know
if you wanted to see me.

176
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:48,920
Of course I would want to see you.
I think about you all the time.

177
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,339
Really?
Because I think about you all the time.

178
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,675
- Really?
- There's a statue in Minsk...

179
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,885
...that reminds me of you so much.

180
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,346
I mean, um, it's actually of Lenin...

181
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,142
- ...but, you know, at certain angles...
- Yeah.

182
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,312
Anyway, do you want
to have dinner tonight?

183
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,063
Yes.

184
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,858
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

185
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,318
- Uh, what?
- I can't.

186
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,779
I can't believe I have plans. I can't.
Can you do it tomorrow?

187
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:19,367
Uh, no, I have to go in a few hours.
I have to be on the redeye.

188
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,662
Well, listen, you know,
next time you're in Minsk, uh...

189
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,583
- Phoebe? Can I talk to you for a second?
- Uh-huh.

190
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,792
What are you doing?

191
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,630
- Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.
- So? He'll understand.

192
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,132
No, he won't.
And that's not even the point.

193
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:39,596
Monica, I made a whole speech about
how you do not cancel plans with friends.

194
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:44,059
And now, you know, what? Just because,
potentially, the love of my life...

195
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:49,105
...comes back from Russia just for
one night, I should change my beliefs?

196
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,274
I should change my beliefs.

197
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:56,488
No. No, no. If I don't have my principles,
I don't have anything.

198
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,989
God, you are so strong.

199
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:02,035
Or I should rush through dinner
with Joey and I could meet David at 9.

200
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,503
Oh, my God, that is so good.

201
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:15,256
I'm full. And yet I know
if I stop eating this...

202
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,258
...I'll regret it.

203
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,804
Hey, what have you got there?

204
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,597
Oh, it's, um...

205
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,558
- It's tofu cake. Do you want some?
- Aah.

206
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,064
- What are you doing tonight?
- Huh?

207
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,525
- Uh.
- Dude. Dude.

208
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:38,071
Sorry. Uh, I got those plans with Phoebe.
Why?

209
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,157
Oh, really? Uh, Monica said
she had a date at 9.

210
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:44,035
- What? Tonight?
- That's what Monica said.

211
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,912
After she gave me that big speech...

212
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,165
...she goes and makes a date on
the same night she has plans with me?

213
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,835
I think she's trying to pull a fast one
on Big Daddy.

214
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,469
Here, I think this is us. Yeah.

215
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,139
Limited seating, my ass.

216
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,683
Let's just see who made the cut.

217
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,602
Hi. Hi. I'm Monica Geller.

218
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,272
- How do you know the bride and groom?
- I worked with Frannie.

219
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,983
Used to work with her. Used to.

220
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,402
I'm a relative and I didn't get invited,
okay?

221
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,946
A blood relative. Blood.

222
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,492
Stop saying "blood" to strangers.

223
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,246
So how about you?
How do you know the happy couple?

224
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,291
We went to college with both of them.
And now we live next door.

225
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,127
Okay, you're fine.

226
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,134
- Hey. Are you guys ready?
- Hey. Yes.

227
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:45,138
I will have a green salad, um,
house dressing and water's fine.

228
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,390
- Okay.
- And for you, sir?

229
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,393
Yeah. This slow-roasted salmon...

230
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,978
...just how slow are we talking?

231
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,273
It's already been roasted.

232
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:59,319
Oh, then no. Maybe I should hear
those specials again.

233
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,322
Oh, Joey, we've heard
the specials three times, okay?

234
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,409
There's prime rib, mahi-mahi
and a very special lobster ravioli.

235
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:11,331
- Actually, we're out of the lobster ravioli.
- Oh, well, that changes everything.

236
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,584
- You know what, Pheebs?
- Uh-huh.

237
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,962
You were right before.
Friends are so important.

238
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,632
Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.

239
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,342
You know what I really want?

240
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,720
- What?
- Is to have a long, long talk.

241
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:29,891
You know? Get Joey out on the
open road and really open him up.

242
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,602
- Any progress?
- Yes.

243
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,605
I will have the lobster ravioli.

244
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,900
God, Joey, this is taking forever.

245
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,735
- What's the rush?
- Well...

246
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,655
...I just have, you know, an appointment.

247
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,740
And it's very important.

248
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,075
What is it?

249
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,786
Well...

250
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:50,995
...it's a date.

251
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,874
A date? No, no, Pheebs,
you must be mistaken...

252
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,751
...because you wouldn't
schedule a date...

253
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,670
...on the night you have plans
with a friend.

254
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,713
Come on.
Don't make me feel badly about this.

255
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,423
No, I'm gonna.

256
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,261
That's right.
Yeah, you made me feel really guilty...

257
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,762
...about going out with that girl.

258
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,724
Like I did something terrible to you.
Now, Pheebs, you're doing the same thing.

259
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,602
That's not the same thing.
This is totally different.

260
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,856
This is with David.
Remember David, the scientist guy?

261
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,566
Okay, he's very special to me.

262
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,901
Okay, well, my girl
from the other night was special.

263
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,319
She was a scientist too.

264
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,364
- She was?
- Well, she graduated high school.

265
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,908
Okay, whatever. Know what?

266
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,410
I don't have time to convince you.

267
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,787
He's only here for four hours
and I'm gonna go see him.

268
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,748
- Fine. Fine!
- Yeah. Yeah.

269
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,753
What are you still doing here?
I told you, lobster ravioli.

270
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,465
- Hey.
- Hey.

271
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,594
Oh, I was just about to leave.
I didn't think you were coming.

272
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,263
Oh, I wouldn't have missed this. Ha, ha.

273
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,390
Well, I'm very glad you're here.

274
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,226
Oh, you're such a gentleman.

275
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,520
Come on, we're going to my place.

276
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,654
Are you eating the cheesecake
without me?

277
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,489
Mm-mm.

278
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,952
I will give you $100 to whistle right now.

279
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,584
How can you eat the cheesecake
without me?

280
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,793
What are you gonna do?

281
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:24,714
Gonna run and tell Monica or Joey?
No, you'd have to tell them what we did.

282
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:28,635
We are dessert stealers.
We are living outside the law.

283
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,304
You know what?
I don't trust you with this cake.

284
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,098
- And I got it first, and I'm taking it back.
- What?

285
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,352
- What? Oh, no, you don't.
- Oh, yes.

286
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,854
You think I trust you with it?

287
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,981
We're gonna split it.
You take half, I take half.

288
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,650
That's not fair. You had some.

289
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,778
Oh, you know what? I think Monica
would be very interested to know...

290
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,864
...that you called her cheesecake
dry and mealy.

291
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,659
- What do we use to split it?
- Okay.

292
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,747
- All right, pick a half.
- Okay.

293
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:01,042
- Well, this side looks bigger.
- Mm-hm.

294
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,963
Uh, but there's more crust on this side.

295
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,382
Yeah. So maybe if I measure it...

296
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,841
For God's sake, pick a piece.

297
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:13,012
- All right, I pick that one.
- So the smaller piece.

298
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,598
Okay. There you go.

299
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,935
Enjoy your half, my friend. But that is it.

300
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,730
No sharing, no switching,
and don't come crying to me...

301
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,774
...if you eat your piece too fast.

302
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,908
Oh!

303
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,038
- You gonna give me some of your piece?
- Oh, no.

304
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,750
No switching, no sharing.
And don't come crying to me.

305
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:46,838
Ha, ha. I may just sit here
and have my cake all day.

306
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,216
Just sit here in the hallway
and eat my...

307
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:02,145
Never met a girl that could me feel...

308
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,188
Ross, sweetheart.

309
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,065
Oh, hey, Aunt Millie.

310
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:10,319
- Isn't it a beautiful wedding?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

311
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,743
Every time, on the lips.

312
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,995
Why? Why on the lips?

313
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,959
There's Frannie.
Won't she be happy to see me?

314
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,128
Now, wait a minute.
You be nice, all right?

315
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,547
I didn't bring you here
so you could ambush her.

316
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,925
Frannie was the one who found
your Playboys and showed them to Mom.

317
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,302
That bitch.

318
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,101
Monica. What...?

319
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,979
Am I doing here? Surprised to see me?

320
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,482
Ross brought me.
How do you like that?

321
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,984
Hi, Frannie. Congratulations.

322
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:55,156
You invite my brother, you invite
my whole family, and not me? Why?

323
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,075
Why wouldn't you want me
at your wedding?

324
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,743
What could I have possibly done?

325
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,246
Stuart.

326
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,166
I believe you know my husband.

327
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:10,755
So it's really a question
of "who" could you have possibly done.

328
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,808
- I hate this, but I have to go.
- Mm-hm.

329
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,602
I can't miss my flight.

330
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,021
Are you sure? I bet there's
another flight to Minsk in...

331
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,397
July.

332
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,910
That's really beautiful.
What does it mean?

333
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,704
"Please clean my beakers."

334
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,207
I don't get out of the lab much.

335
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,712
I thought it meant something else.

336
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,050
Yeah, well, I really actually
wanted to say, um...

337
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,385
...that.

338
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,012
But, um, I figured
I probably shouldn't because...

339
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,558
...you know, I have to leave.

340
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,936
Hmm. No, you're right. Don't say it.

341
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,398
I do, though.

342
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,068
I do too.

343
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,245
Well, bye, Phoebe.

344
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:39,302
Okay, now's not the time, Joey, all right?
You can yell at me tomorrow.

345
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,221
No, no. No, Pheebs.
I'm not gonna yell at you.

346
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,266
I just started thinking
about you and David...

347
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:49,437
...and I remember how bummed you were
the first time he left.

348
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,983
Oh, Pheebs, come here.

349
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,237
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

350
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,158
The only guy I've ever been
crazy about is going to Minsk...

351
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,328
...and I may never see him again.

352
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,330
Hey, you could always visit him.

353
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,082
Oh, right.
Like they're gonna let me have a passport.

354
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,253
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.

355
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,299
Well, now...

356
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:23,054
...if you achieve positronic distillation
of subatomic particles before he does...

357
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,597
...then he could come back.

358
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,773
I could give it a shot.

359
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,365
Oh, look. There's a piece
that doesn't have floor on it.

360
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,826
- Stick to your side.
- Come on, now.

361
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,090
All right, what are we having?

362
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,683
Oh, wait, I forgot my wrap.

363
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,310
Oh, okay, wait here.

364
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,038
Hi, sweetie. Are you leaving?

365
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:34,542
- Well...
- Give us a kiss. Come on.

366
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,387
Why? Why on the lips?
