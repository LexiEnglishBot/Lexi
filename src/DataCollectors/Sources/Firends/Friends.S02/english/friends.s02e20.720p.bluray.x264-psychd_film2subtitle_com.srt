1
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,340
Hey.

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,844
- What you guys doing?
- Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.

3
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:17,641
Why are you guys upset?
It's Old Yeller. It's a happy movie.

4
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,310
- What?
- What are you talking about?

5
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,771
Come on. Happy family gets a dog.

6
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,565
Frontier fun!

7
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,277
Pheebs, what about the end?

8
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,613
Oh, when Yeller saves the family
from the wolf and everyone's happy?

9
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:32,990
That's not the end.

10
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:37,077
Yeah-huh. That's when my mother would
shut off the TV and say, "The end. "

11
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,581
What about when he has rabies?

12
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,125
He doesn't have rabies.
He has babies.

13
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,754
That's what my mom said.

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,550
Uh, Phoebe, I don't think she'd want you
to see what's about to happen.

15
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,178
Why? What's about to happen?

16
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,180
I've never seen this part.

17
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:59,391
Hey, Travis, what you doing
with that gun?

18
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,145
Oh, no.

19
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,606
No, no, Travis, put down the gun.

20
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,567
No, no, he's your buddy.
He's your Yeller.

21
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,235
No! The end! The end!

22
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,992
Okay, what kind of a sick
doggy snuff film is this?

23
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:11,505
Have you guys eaten? Uh, Richard and I
just finished, and we've got leftovers.

24
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,799
Chicken and potatoes.

25
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,718
What am I wearing?

26
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,847
Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.

27
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:29,398
One of these times, you'll really
be naked and we won't come over.

28
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,276
I got a leg, three breasts
and a wing.

29
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,404
How do you find clothes that fit?

30
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,740
Oh, hey, Monica? We got a question.

31
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,327
All right, yes, I see other women
in the shower at the gym.

32
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,996
And no, I don't look.

33
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,206
No, not that one.

34
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,334
We're figuring out who to bring
to the Knicks game.

35
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,796
Ross can't go, so it's between my friend
Eric Prower, who has breath issues...

36
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,551
...and Dan, with the poking.
"Did you see that play?"

37
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,888
"You want more beer?
Is that Spike Lee?"

38
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,265
Ha, ha, okay.

39
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,976
Why don't you ask Richard?

40
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,147
Uh, Richard, if you had an extra
ticket to the Knicks game...

41
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,111
...and you had to choose between
a friend who smelled...

42
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:20,032
...and one who bruises you,
who would you pick?

43
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,491
Wow.

44
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,493
Being a huge Knicks fan myself...

45
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:27,748
...I think you should take someone
who's a huge Knicks fan.

46
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,666
Okay.

47
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,418
That's Eric.

48
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,838
Glad to be of help. Matches.

49
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,550
I meant, why don't you
take Richard to the game?

50
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,302
Eh.

51
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,887
What?

52
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,890
- I don't know.
- Come on!

53
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:49,561
He keeps his fingers to himself,
and he's always minty fresh.

54
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,315
Richard's really nice.
Uh, we just don't know him really well.

55
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,234
Plus, he's old...

56
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,988
- er than some people.

57
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,075
But, uh, younger than some buildings.

58
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,704
So what, he's a little older.
Big deal.

59
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,498
He's important to me.

60
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,626
If you ask him,
he might take you in his Jag.

61
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,590
How do we say yes...

62
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,593
...and make it seem like it's not
just to ride in the cool car?

63
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,264
Okay, this could be tough.

64
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,225
Okay, okay, okay. Monica?

65
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,895
We'll bring him,
but only if he takes the Jaguar.

66
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,275
Ooh, you almost had it.

67
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,866
No, no, you're fine. You're fine.

68
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,994
- Hello, ha, ha.
- Hey.

69
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,829
Hi, honey. Oh.

70
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,498
You are not gonna believe
what happened!

71
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,876
We were playing on the floor,
and he grabs the table...

72
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,087
...and he pulls himself up!

73
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,674
He pulled himself up!

74
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,384
Standing man!

75
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:07,264
I'm sorry you missed it,
but I did tape it if you wanna see it.

76
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,392
Uh, we know.
He already did it last week.

77
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,728
You can watch our tape if you want.

78
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:17,316
Ah, see, I don't believe this.
I missed the first time of everything.

79
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,736
The first time he rolled over,
the first time he crawled.

80
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,280
What else? Has he spoken?
Is he driving?

81
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,158
Does he have a favorite liqueur?

82
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,827
He is getting closer
on the talking thing.

83
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:32,372
He can't quite say "mama" yet,
but once he said "Yemen. "

84
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,376
See, I don't know.
I'm so sick of missing stuff.

85
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:40,172
I want him for more than a day.
I want him for a whole weekend.

86
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,423
Listen. I feel...

87
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,008
That would be great.

88
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,680
Really? I had a whole speech prepared.

89
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,974
Oh, shoot, that would've been fun.

90
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,395
Oh, look, did you just see that?

91
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,190
Did you see? He just waved!
He just waved!

92
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,692
He's never waved before!

93
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,153
Yes, he has. Very good.

94
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,325
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs. What you got there?

95
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:12,454
Love Story, Brian's Song and
Terms of Endearment.

96
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,332
Wow, all you need now
is The Killing Fields...

97
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,126
...and some guacamole,
and you got yourself a party!

98
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,464
I talked to my grandma
about the Old Yeller incident...

99
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:26,468
...and she said my mom used to not
show us the ends of sad movies...

100
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,388
...to shield us from
the pain and sadness.

101
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,182
You know, before she killed herself.

102
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,852
- Hey.
- Hey.

103
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,230
Where's Richard?
Did you ditch him?

104
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,483
After we stole his lunch money
and gave him a wedgie.

105
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,278
What's the matter with you?
He's parking the car.

106
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,991
- Did you guys have fun?
- Your boyfriend is so cool.

107
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:54,204
He let us drive his Jaguar.
Joey for 12 blocks. Me for 15.

108
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,914
Wow.

109
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,582
He must like you best.

110
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,586
Oh, what about when he tipped the guy
who showed us to our seats?

111
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,713
You never even saw the money.

112
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,675
Hey, Chandler, thanks for
showing us to our seats.

113
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,804
Ha, ha, you're welcome.
Hey, Joey, thanks for parking the car.

114
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,681
No problem, ha, ha.

115
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,184
- Hey, Chandler...
- I think they get it.

116
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,021
There's the man!

117
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,982
Hey.

118
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,900
- Hey, you're getting better.
- Huh? Ha, ha.

119
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,111
I'm gonna keep this.

120
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,071
Okay.

121
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,322
He kept my dollar.

122
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,165
Your first weekend without Ben.
What are you doing?

123
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,292
Ah, we're going to
colonial Williamsburg.

124
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,963
A woman I went to college with is
the first female blacksmith there.

125
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,383
They're a little behind the times
in colonial Williamsburg.

126
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:52,095
Ha, ha. Well, look, I better go
before Mommy starts weeping.

127
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,265
We love you.
- Bye, Mommy.

128
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,309
Have a good time.

129
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,436
Okay, Ben.

130
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,687
- Ross.
- Yeah?

131
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,938
Look.

132
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,656
Joey, do you know
we can see you from here?

133
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,785
How come Richard looks cooler
with one of these?

134
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,914
You may wanna light it
and lose the spatula.

135
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,710
It's cute, you trying
to be more like Richard.

136
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,670
Not like him, per se.

137
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,048
Just not unlike him.

138
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,810
It's the artist formerly known
as Chandler.

139
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,232
I'm just trying something here,
you know?

140
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,150
Why didn't you grow a mustache?

141
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,527
Oh, we flipped for it.

142
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,570
I got the cigar,
he got the mustache.

143
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,865
If we both grew them,
we'd look like dorks.

144
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,203
You really sidestepped
that land mine.

145
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,540
I promised Richard
we'd meet downstairs.

146
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,791
You're meeting Richard?

147
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,668
- Ranger game.
- Didn't he tell you?

148
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:08,213
He said he was going out with the guys.
I didn't know that was you.

149
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,589
You hear that?

150
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,759
- We're the guys!
- We're the guys!

151
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,512
With that mustache,
he reminds me of Aunt Sylvia.

152
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,013
Thank you!

153
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,567
- Hi, we're visiting.
- Yay.

154
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,778
It's Ben and his dada.

155
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,114
Dada.

156
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,992
- Can you say "dada"?
- Aw.

157
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,287
I'm telling your mommies you said it,
so you might as well.

158
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,080
- No luck, huh?
- No.

159
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,541
A while ago,
I got a "seh" out of him...

160
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:49,671
...which I thought might turn into
"seh-condary caregiver," but...

161
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,385
Would you, uh, hold him for a sec?
I gotta take this off.

162
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,471
- Oh, yeah, sure, okay.
- There we go.

163
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,520
What are you doing?

164
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,647
I'm holding Ben.

165
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,568
Yeah, well, he's a baby, not a bomb.

166
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:13,612
Okay.

167
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,572
Hold him like you'd hold a football.

168
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,617
This is how I would hold a football.

169
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,036
Here. Here. There we go.

170
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:25,582
Sorry, I'm not very good with babies.
I haven't been around them.

171
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,917
- I mean, you know, since I was one.
- Ha, ha.

172
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,962
- It's all right. No big deal.
- Really?

173
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,049
You'll feel different
when it's our baby.

174
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,967
- What?
- What?

175
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,678
You think about stuff like that?

176
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,598
Uh, yeah. I mean...

177
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,186
Actually, I kind of think
that we'll have two babies.

178
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,981
Two babies?

179
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,233
You know, a boy and a girl.

180
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,820
Hopefully, the girl will come first,
so Ben won't feel competitive.

181
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,408
Then what's gonna happen?

182
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:04,663
We won't wanna raise kids in the city,
so we'll move to Scarsdale.

183
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,414
Scar... Uh-huh.

184
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:10,043
We'll be far enough from our parents
so we don't have to see them...

185
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,671
...but close enough
that they can babysit.

186
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:17,092
And yes, I know the taxes are
a little higher than Nassau County...

187
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,344
...but the school system's great.

188
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,055
Wow! Ha, ha.

189
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,891
Wow, that's great! Great!

190
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,727
- Okay, wow! You know what?
Hmm?

191
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,605
I'm off my break now. So, uh...

192
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,732
Um, here. You take this.

193
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,901
And, um...

194
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,154
I'm gonna go pour these
very nice people some coffee.

195
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,447
Okay.

196
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,658
Look at that. I don't have a pot.

197
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,285
I don't have a pot.
Maybe I've got one at home.

198
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,871
Or in Scarsdale.
Hey, is that a door?

199
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,623
Rach.

200
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,088
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs. What's happening?

201
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:59,551
Oh, okay, murder, cancer, soccer teams
eating each other in the Andes.

202
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,263
- You watched the movies?
Uh-huh.

203
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,099
What is happening to the world?

204
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,477
I mean...
No, no, because E.T. Leaves...

205
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,355
...and Rocky loses. Charlotte dies.

206
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,065
Charlotte who?

207
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,608
With the web. The spider.

208
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,986
She dies. She has babies and dies.

209
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,281
It's like, "Welcome home
from the hospital. " Thud!

210
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,033
You wanna feel better?

211
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,619
Yeah.
- Okay.

212
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,873
Here. Watch this.

213
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,709
It's a Wonderful Life.
Yes, I've heard of this.

214
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,503
So you can't lose.
It's there in the title.

215
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,422
Wonderfulness is baked right in.

216
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,091
I fell for that with
Pride of the Yankees.

217
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,385
I thought I'd see a film
about Yankee pride.

218
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,722
And boom! The guy gets
Lou Gehrig's disease.

219
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:51,728
Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig.
Didn't you kind of see it coming?

220
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,357
Watch that. It'll restore
all your faith in humanity.

221
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,235
Hey, big guy. Game time.

222
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:02,280
- Hey! Be right there!
- There's a game?

223
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,617
I just got my Pik-Up Stiks
back from the shop.

224
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,745
Bring your nerves of steel.

225
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,041
It's the basketball playoffs.

226
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:17,754
Um, I appreciate this, but you don't
have to hang out with them for me.

227
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,464
They have each other.

228
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,841
Oh, no, honey. I mean, don't worry.

229
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,970
I like hanging out with them.
They're different than my other friends.

230
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,225
They don't start sentences with "You
know who just died shoveling snow?"

231
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,645
All right, that's great.
Then just go.

232
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,480
Go Knicks!

233
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,941
- Uh, it's the college playoffs.
Oh.

234
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,527
- Then, go Vassar!
- Uh, they're not in it.

235
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,571
- Okay, then just go.
- Okay.

236
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,658
Ugh, why does this bother me
so much?

237
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:51,704
I'm not one of those people who wants
to spend 24 hours a day together.

238
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,164
Sure.

239
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,501
He just doesn't have much free time.
What do I do?

240
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,630
Does it matter? You'll just die
or divorce or blow your pet's head off.

241
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,718
- Ugh!
- Me too!

242
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:09,347
Rachel, I got a question. Richard
made plans again with the guys...

243
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,474
Ross made plans for the century.

244
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:15,645
I'm gonna go read Cosmo.
Maybe there's something helpful in it.

245
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:20,608
If not, I can learn how to do a bikini
wax with leftover Christmas candles.

246
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,528
Okay.

247
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,530
What happened back there?

248
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,532
I don't know. You tell me.

249
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,493
One minute I'm holding Ben,
then I've got two kids...

250
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,663
...I'm living in Scarsdale
complaining about taxes!

251
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,499
Well, I'm sorry.
I think about stuff.

252
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,545
You're at work, you're assembling bones,
your mind wanders.

253
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,382
You've planned out the next 20 years.
We've dated for six weeks!

254
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,467
You never think about our future?

255
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,762
I think about whose apartment
we'll sleep at tomorrow...

256
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,098
...and where we'll have dinner
next Saturday!

257
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,851
I do not think about
our children's names!

258
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,813
You know what our
children's names will be?

259
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,481
Ha, ha, no.

260
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,277
No, I mean, you know. I read a book,
and there was a girl named Emily.

261
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,696
And I thought that might be good.

262
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,574
What was the book?

263
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,702
The Big Book of Children's Names.

264
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,163
Okay. Ross, Ross.

265
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,497
Okay, listen.

266
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,166
What we have is amazing.

267
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,252
But I do not want
everything decided for me!

268
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,046
I spent my whole life like that.

269
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,924
It's what I had with Barry.
That's a reason I left.

270
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,092
I like not knowing right now.

271
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,305
Sorry if that scares you, but if you
wanna be with me, deal with that!

272
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,265
- Okay, fine!
- Thank you!

273
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,809
- We're not done!
- I didn't know that.

274
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:41,356
You're with a guy who won't stop
planning his future with you.

275
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,399
He knows we'll end up together.

276
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,819
If that scares you, tough!
You'll have to deal with that.

277
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,988
- I will!
- Good, because I love you!

278
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,740
Oh, yeah? I love you too!

279
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,159
- That's the first time we've said that!
- Yes.

280
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,828
- I'm gonna kiss you!
- You better!

281
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,586
- Hey.
- Hey.

282
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,338
Oh, thanks for the great movie tip.

283
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,423
- Did you like it?
- Oh, yeah.

284
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:11,177
I don't know if I was happier when
George Bailey destroyed the business...

285
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:15,264
...or, um, Donna Reed cried or when
the pharmacist made his ear bleed.

286
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,978
I'll give you the ear thing,
but wasn't the ending wonderful?

287
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,313
I didn't watch it.
I was too depressed.

288
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,816
It kept getting worse!
It should've been called:

289
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:29,362
"It's a Sucky Life, And Just When You
Think It Can't Suck Anymore, It Does!"

290
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,533
Kick, save! And...

291
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,034
...denied!

292
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,706
He gets it back.
Pass to the middle, lines it up and bam!

293
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:40,957
Yes!

294
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,293
Could that shot be any prettier?

295
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,504
Man, you are incredible.

296
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,464
We had a table in college.

297
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,967
Oh, really? I didn't know they had
foosball in the 1800s.

298
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,847
Nice mustache. At puberty,
that thing will really kick in.

299
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,480
Not to sound too Florence Henderson,
but dinner's on the table.

300
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,815
One more point.

301
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,069
Score!

302
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,197
- Now can we go?
- Uh...

303
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,908
That's why we don't let her play.

304
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,955
- Is everything all right?
- Mm-hm.

305
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,206
Uh-oh.

306
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,709
Oh, hey, don't be mad at him.
It's our fault.

307
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,878
I'm sorry we've been hogging his time.

308
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,213
He's just really great
to hang out with.

309
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,631
- Well...
No, seriously.

310
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,343
We just talked about this.
He is so much cooler than our dads.

311
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,515
Our dads are okay and all,
but Richard is just...

312
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,893
Ow, ow, ow.
What are you kicking me for?

313
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,980
Huh? I'm trying to talk here.

314
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,359
Uh, you guys see me as a dad?

315
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,320
- Oh, yeah.
- No!

316
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,697
No.

317
00:17:56,116 --> 00:18:00,244
You're just clearly not familiar
with our young persons' vernacular.

318
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,831
When we say "dad," we mean "buddy. "

319
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,542
- We mean "pal. "
- Uh-huh, yeah.

320
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,337
No, seriously. Joey's my dad.

321
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,092
Monica's my dad.

322
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,345
I've even got some dads down at work.

323
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,805
That's fine.

324
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:23,309
Well, your other dad and I are gonna
go have a romantic evening.

325
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,603
I'll just see you kids around.

326
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,146
Nighty-night.

327
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,233
You're not a dad!
- You're not a dad!

328
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,652
I can't believe you got us
into trouble.

329
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,742
So are you okay?

330
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,911
Yeah.

331
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,204
Just...

332
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,832
...I feel like I'm about a hundred.

333
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,168
I thought I was just one of the guys.

334
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:50,962
Come here.

335
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,048
I'll make you feel like
one of the guys.

336
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,762
Mm.

337
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,932
For a really cool guy,
you suck at foosball.

338
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,852
I was killing them.

339
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,271
- Yeah, well they suck too.
- Ha, ha.

340
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,857
Hmm.

341
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:15,027
You take the poopy diaper
and put it in the poopy diaper pail.

342
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,365
Calling it a "poopy diaper"
doesn't make this process any cuter.

343
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,162
- Hello.
It's us.

344
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,413
Come on up.

345
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,206
I'll get his stuff together.

346
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,418
Okay, we can do this now,
can't we, Ben?

347
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,921
Yes, we can.

348
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,884
There! I did it!

349
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,886
Ha, ha, I did it!

350
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,597
Ooh, look at that!

351
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,808
Oh, it stays on and everything.

352
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,727
- Hi.
Hi.

353
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,485
I'm sorry. What did you just say?
Did you just say "hi"?

354
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,530
Oh, my God! Ross?
Ben just said hi!

355
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,073
- What?
- Ben just said hi!

356
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,783
What, the word "hi"?

357
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,785
No, my Uncle Hi.

358
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,748
Great! And I missed that too.
I miss everything!

359
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,043
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I just
bring it out in him.

360
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,880
- Where is he?
- We missed you.

361
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:19,634
We missed you so much!
Come here, Ben, ha, ha.

362
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,303
Guess what?
Ben just said his first word.

363
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,347
What did he say?

364
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,057
Something about hi.

365
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,603
- That's so exciting!
- Mommy's so proud of you!

366
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,022
Hi. Hi?

367
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,316
You know, actually,
it's more like, hi!

368
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,902
- Hi?
- Hi.

369
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,780
- Hi.
- Hi.

370
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,698
This could go on for a while.

371
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,867
You're right.
We've got a cab waiting.

372
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,869
Well, this was fun.

373
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,997
We should do it again sometime, Ben.
What do you say?

374
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,249
Okay.

375
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,085
- All right, so I've got him?
- Tuesday.

376
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,419
Bye, you guys.

377
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,296
Take care.
- Bye, Ben.

378
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,382
Bye.

379
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,761
Did he just say "bye"?

380
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,096
He said bye!

381
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,306
You said... He said bye to me!

382
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,433
- Yes, he did!
- Oh.

383
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,270
Suddenly I'm seeing him
go off to college!

384
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,315
We've gotta go.
We've got that cab downstairs.

385
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,567
See you later.

386
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,027
- Bye.
Bye.

387
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,320
- Oh!
- Ha, ha.

388
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,491
- Bye.
Bye.

389
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,535
Bye.

390
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,078
Oh.

391
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,298
Wow. Look at this nice deep hole I dug.
Hey, Bert...

392
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,091
...isn't this a nice hole here?

393
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,342
Okay, ahem.

394
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:48,055
Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries
Bert in the sand and can't find him.

395
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,769
Now, I've looked ahead on the tape,
and he does find him again.

396
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:58,524
But before that happens,
there's some rough going for a while.

397
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,818
But I think we can handle it.

398
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:06,198
And there's just the alphabet,
but we know that ends well, so...

399
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,742
Here we go.

400
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,327
Bert? Bert?

401
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,203
Bert?

402
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,999
What happened to my friend Bert?
He was here just a moment ago.

403
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,293
Oh, no! My old friend Bert is lost.

404
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,545
- Mm.
- I'm so glad you're here.
