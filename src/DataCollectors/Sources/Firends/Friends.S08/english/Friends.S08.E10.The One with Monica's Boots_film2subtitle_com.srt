1
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:08,257
- Hey.
- Hey. So, what do you think?

2
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:15,472
New haircut? Necklace? Dress?
Boots? Boots!

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:21,603
Yes! They're a little more than
I usually spend on boots. Um, or rent.

4
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:22,938
Oh, my God.

5
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:27,109
- I know.
- I'll miss being able to afford food.

6
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:31,363
I'm sorry. They just looked so good.
The saleswoman was like:

7
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,783
- "These are too expensive for you."
- She had a point.

8
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,830
- Hey.
- Hi. Oh, my God.

9
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:45,586
- Oh, Monica, those boots are amazing!
- They're mine!

10
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:52,176
- Too bad we'll have to return them.
- Return them? Shh! They're gonna hear you.

11
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,635
I'm not returning them.

12
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:57,473
I know they cost a lot,
but I'll wear them all the time. You'll see!

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,726
Besides, I love the compliments.

14
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,645
Have you ever had something
everyone wants?

15
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:06,899
- I have you.
- Nice try. I'm keeping the boots.

16
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,526
That's right. I love you.

17
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:55,030
And I'm gonna play with you
all the time.

18
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:59,201
How can you let him talk
to your crotch like that?

19
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:05,374
- He's talking to the baby.
- Oh! Okay.

20
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,420
Okay. When he said, "I can't wait
to hear your first words"...

21
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,548
...I thought, "There's a trick."

22
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,970
Okay, well I gotta go, you guys.
I'll see you later.

23
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,221
- Okay.
- All right.

24
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,472
Bye.

25
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,100
- Oh, hey, Rach. Um...
- Hi.

26
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:27,020
Can you do me a favor? My sister
knows you work at Ralph Lauren...

27
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:30,357
Forget it! No way.
I'm not sending more clothes to prison.

28
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,360
- It is a waste.
- No! Not her.

29
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:37,072
My youngest sister, Dina.
She's interested in fashion.

30
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,409
She wants to talk to someone successful
to give her some advice.

31
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:44,413
- I'll talk to my supervisor.
- No, no. She wants to talk to you.

32
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:48,876
Really? Oh, my God. I'm successful.

33
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,255
- Would you meet with her?
- I'd love to. Have her come by.

34
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:58,343
Great. You'll love her. She's the smartest
of all the Tribbiani children.

35
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,970
- Yeah, you know the SATs?
- Yeah.

36
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,181
She took them.

37
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,643
Hey, Ross,
doesn't Ben go to Smithfield School?

38
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:07,853
Yeah. Why?

39
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,315
- Sting has a son that goes there.
- I know. He's in Ben's class.

40
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,233
You knew and never said anything?

41
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:17,154
With all the stupid
dinosaur stuff you tell us?

42
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,909
Fine, no more dinosaur stuff.
Can I talk about fossils?

43
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,793
"Sting's son, 7." There's a picture.

44
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:36,632
What are you reading? "A Kidnapper's
Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?"

45
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,552
It's New York Magazine, an article
about the best schools in the city.

46
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,223
- So how well do you know Sting?
- I haven't met him.

47
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:49,811
Uh-huh. That's too bad. I wanna go to
his concert Friday, but it's sold out.

48
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,066
I know! Why don't you meet him
and get tickets?

49
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,944
If you get two, I'll take you.

50
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,613
I'm picking Ben up tomorrow.
Maybe he'll be there.

51
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:04,409
There you go. Ugh, you're so lucky.
You might meet Sting tomorrow.

52
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,246
That's why you have kids.

53
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,337
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

54
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:19,091
Hi, Monica. Hi, boots.

55
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,928
See? I'm getting a lot of use
out of them already.

56
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:27,557
They're very practical. You can wear them
with dresses, skirts, pants...

57
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:31,520
Wear them with shorts on the corner
and earn money to pay for them.

58
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:37,567
- Wow, they're beautiful.
- They hurt so much.

59
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,861
- What?
- The guy who made these...

60
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:43,323
...hates feet
and wants to see them die.

61
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:47,035
Give them to me.
I haven't felt my feet in years.

62
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:51,331
I can't. I spent so much on them, and
told Chandler I'd wear them all the time.

63
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,793
- I can't just give them away.
- Then get your money back, return them.

64
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,044
I can't do that either.

65
00:04:56,212 --> 00:05:01,258
The soles are scuffed up, and the
insides are filled with my blood.

66
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,052
- Hey.
- Hey.

67
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,431
- Hey, I, uh, just picked up Ben from school.
- Oh.

68
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,975
I don't think you did
a very thorough job.

69
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,603
I dropped him off at Carol's.

70
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,606
Anyway, I'm not gonna
get those tickets.

71
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,608
Oh, no. Why not?

72
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:22,154
Well, it turns out Ben and Sting's son
do not get along.

73
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,324
- How come?
- Apparently, Sting's son made fun...

74
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,869
...of the fact that Ben's moms
are "les-be-nims."

75
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:33,332
Wait! If they don't get along,
you should smooth things over.

76
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:37,252
- Make them be friends.
- You can't force kids to be friends.

77
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,756
Sure you can. Give them some blocks.
Put them in a playpen.

78
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:46,303
- Playpen? Ben's 7.
- Your kid is 7?

79
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,638
He's really small.

80
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,144
- Please! Please get the tickets.
- I'm sorry. I just can't do it.

81
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:58,106
- Yes, you can. Sting says so himself.
- What?

82
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,318
Ross can!

83
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,905
Look, Pheeb, I'm sorry...

84
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,325
Ross can!

85
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:10,911
Phoebe?

86
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:16,375
Ross can get me the tickets!

87
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,717
Here she is.
Future fashion superstar.

88
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,888
- Oh, Joey, I'm hardly...
- My little sister, Dina!

89
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,057
- Right. Hi, Dina. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

90
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,519
Thanks for meeting me.
Joey's told me so much about you.

91
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,437
This is exciting for her.

92
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,815
Well, I'll let you two fash...

93
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,692
...ists get down to business.

94
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,238
Okay. All right, Dina.

95
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,825
Let's talk about the different
areas of fashion...

96
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,619
...you could get involved in.

97
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,373
Let's see. There's design.
But you may need another degree for that.

98
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,960
Uh, there's sales, which is great.
You get to travel.

99
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,504
I don't care about fashion! I'm pregnant.

100
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,798
And I know you are too,
so you gotta help me.

101
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,220
And there's marketing.

102
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,564
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

103
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,111
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

104
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,537
- What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing. I'm just... I just was yawning.

105
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,959
Don't forget my office
holiday party tonight.

106
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,462
We don't really have to go tonight,
do we?

107
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,298
Sweetie, I know that you don't like
my office parties.

108
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,718
- But you can wear your new boots.
- Ha, ha.

109
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:53,597
See? Every cloud has
a supple leather lining.

110
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:58,477
- I don't wanna wear the boots tonight.
- Why not?

111
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:03,148
I'm worried your bosses might see them
and think they pay you too much money.

112
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,776
Or your assistant will see them
and want a raise.

113
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:11,072
Do you think I work at
a boot-pricing company?

114
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,826
Anyway, I picked an outfit,
and the boots don't go with it.

115
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,661
You said you paid all that money...

116
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,831
...because those boots go with skirts,
dresses and pants.

117
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,751
Fine, if you want me to wear the boots,
I'll wear the boots.

118
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,795
In fact, I'll go in to my room now
and try the outfit on.

119
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,130
- Okay.
- Okay.

120
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,510
Ooh-wee! Ha, ha.

121
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,471
Christmas party in my boots!

122
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,640
Ha, ha, ow, ha, ha, ow.

123
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,687
I can't go in there. I can't tell him.

124
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,775
It'll be okay.
He's been incredibly supportive of me.

125
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:51,738
And if he gets a little upset,
that's what the meatball sub is for.

126
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,115
- Thank you.
- Okay.

127
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,995
Hey! It's my fashion girls!

128
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,708
- What's wrong?
- Why don't you sit down?

129
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,169
Dina has something
that she wants to tell you.

130
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,966
Oh. What's going on? Is it Mom?

131
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:15,804
Is she sick? Is it Dad's heart?
Is that a sandwich?

132
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,686
- Joe, Mom and Dad are fine.
- Is that a sandwich?

133
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:30,068
Joey, there's something
that you should know. Dina?

134
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,573
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

135
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,033
Now. Give him the sandwich.
Give him the sandwich!

136
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,705
Obviously, this is a mistake.
You can't be pregnant.

137
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,374
You have to have sex to get pregnant.

138
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,545
Joe, I tried to wait until
I was 25, like you did.

139
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,424
- What? Dina...
- Bub!

140
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,925
Sh...

141
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:59,973
I can't believe this! You're
the good one. You went to college.

142
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,809
Both years!

143
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,856
- Who did this to you?
- Bobby Corso. But he's a real nice guy.

144
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,858
I like him a lot. He's real funny.

145
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,611
You got pregnant for "funny"?

146
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,865
Dina, if he's funny, laugh!

147
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,621
- I'll be back in a while. Stay here!
- Why?

148
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:26,166
I can't look at you right now.

149
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,630
- Wow.
- I know.

150
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,146
Oh, there you are, Ben.

151
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,523
Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?

152
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,234
I heard you have a problem
with a boy in your class.

153
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,570
And so I thought
I'd just come down here...

154
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,948
...I'd sit you both down,
have a talk and make it all okay.

155
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:02,952
Now, um, the boy's name is Sting's son.

156
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,706
Jack? I hate him. He's a jerk.

157
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:10,877
Now, Ben, sometimes people may seem
like jerks on the outside...

158
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,588
...but they have famous fathers.

159
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,384
I have to go.
My friend Doug is waiting for me.

160
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,928
Him you're friends with.

161
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,061
Excuse me,
can I help you with something?

162
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,398
Yes. Yes you can.
I'm looking for Jack's parents.

163
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,401
- Are you with a student?
- Uh-huh. I'm with Ben.

164
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:38,697
- Are you one of Ben's mothers?
- I am one of Ben's mothers.

165
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,283
I'm a lesbian.

166
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:45,120
It was difficult coming out
to my parents.

167
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:49,791
Heh, well, hi. I'm Jenny Boon.
I'm the new teacher here.

168
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,252
- Oh.
- I've only met your partner, Carol.

169
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,588
- Ah! Okay, that would make me Susan.
- Heh.

170
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:59,676
Right. Are you looking
for Jack's parents to discuss...

171
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,512
...the problems he's having with Ben?
Yeah.

172
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,682
I think the parents should sit
down together and converse.

173
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,393
Yeah, let's do that!

174
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,355
That sounds good.
We should sit and talk.

175
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,775
Just me, my lover, Carol, and the Stings.

176
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:20,280
- How will I get in touch with them?
- Their number's on the contact sheet.

177
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:26,786
Uh-huh. Um, could I get a copy of that?
Carol threw it out. She lost ours.

178
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:31,791
She's such a scatterbrain.
But, man, what a hot piece of ass.

179
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,760
- That wasn't bad.
- I didn't know there'd be dancing.

180
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,471
That was a fun surprise!

181
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:48,808
- I don't see any, uh, cabs. We should walk.
- No, we can't walk.

182
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,853
It's, like, 15 blocks to the subway.
Let's go.

183
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:57,108
Do you think we can get to the subway
if we climb through that manhole cover?

184
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,737
- What's going on?
- I can't walk, okay? Okay?

185
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,990
- These boots were a huge mistake.
- What?

186
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,284
You were right.
I never should've bought them.

187
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,245
They're killing me, one toe at a time.

188
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:13,333
I was right. This is what
it feels like to be right.

189
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,587
It's oddly unsettling.

190
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,757
How are will gonna get home?
Maybe a piggyback ride?

191
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,884
- Hop on.
- Okay, wait. Give me a second.

192
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,220
Let me just get my boots off first.

193
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,765
Ow.

194
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,644
Oh, God.

195
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:42,028
Honey, I know you're in pain
right now, but I'm a little turned on.

196
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:51,538
Do you worry that you'll be walking
and your baby will slip out?

197
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,793
What college was that, Dina?

198
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,505
Oh, my God! Bobby?

199
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:04,551
Hi, Dina. Good to see you.

200
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:09,222
- Joey, what are you doing?
- Just what needs to be done.

201
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,810
- Dearly beloved, we're gathered here...
- Ugh, Joey, this is crazy.

202
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,230
Don't interrupt me
when I'm talking to God!

203
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:21,067
- Where were we? Do you take this man...?
- No!

204
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,236
- Oh, you'll take him.
- No I won't!

205
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,446
- Hey, you don't get a say.
- Yes I do.

206
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,533
Ah, I heard "I do." We're halfway there.
Okay, you.

207
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,910
All right, Joey, that is enough!

208
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,622
Listen, as beautiful and moving
as this ceremony is, this is not legal.

209
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,710
They don't have a marriage license,
they don't have witnesses...

210
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,254
...and the groom only has on one shoe.

211
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:45,008
Yeah, he took the other one off
and hit me with it.

212
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,926
What am I supposed to do?

213
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:51,139
You're supposed to realize they are adults
and can make their own decisions.

214
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,892
No, they can't.
They're stupid enough to get knocked up!

215
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,102
Hey!

216
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,690
Contraceptives are not always
effective. Right?

217
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:07,614
- Yeah. We kind of didn't use any.
- Oh, come on, kids, a little help here.

218
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:15,496
Wow! This place is incredible!

219
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:22,629
Sting's pen. That he gave to Phoebe.

220
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:31,596
Come on, secret passageway.

221
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

222
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,645
- I'm Trudie. You must be Ben's mum.
- Uh-huh.

223
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,230
Why else would I be here?

224
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,191
- Why don't you sit down?
- Uh-huh.

225
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,610
I gather Jack and Ben
haven't been getting along.

226
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,238
- Yeah.
- I'm sure there are two sides to this.

227
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:53,117
But all I've heard is that Ben's
a bit of a "poo-poo head."

228
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,329
Um, I'm sorry.
Won't Jack's father be joining us?

229
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,665
I'm sorry, Jack's father's not available.

230
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,792
Mm-hm. Okay.

231
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,837
Well then could we reschedule
for Friday night, perhaps at 8:00?

232
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,715
Oh, no, that wouldn't work.
My husband's in concert.

233
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:13,846
Concert. Yeah.
Mm. That just put us in quite a pickle.

234
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,891
Because I'm very busy before
and after the concert...

235
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,810
...and he's obviously busy during.

236
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,271
So you and I should talk about
Jack and Ben now.

237
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,942
Unless... Unless, um...

238
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,487
Okay, I would be willing
to go to the concert...

239
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:33,199
...um, all the while
thinking about the children of course.

240
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:38,037
- Are you here for tickets?
- Ugh, thanks. Four would be great.

241
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:43,001
I'm not giving tickets to someone
who'd use their son like this.

242
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,129
Oh, then you're in luck.
Ben's not my son.

243
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,383
I've pressed a button
triggering an alarm.

244
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:54,887
- Any minute now, the police will be here.
- The Police? Here?

245
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,057
A reunion? Ooh!

246
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:08,693
Okay, 10 blocks down, five to go.

247
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:13,823
- Oh, wait! Stop!
- Oh, I'm sorry. Do you need a break?

248
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:18,161
My boots in tan!
Get closer so I can see the price.

249
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:22,832
I can see it from right here.
It'll cost you one husband.

250
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,004
Okay, I think I can walk the rest
of the way now. Just give me my boots.

251
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:32,216
- I don't have your boots.
- I don't either. Where are they?

252
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,510
Why don't you check
in one of my saddlebags...

253
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,388
...while I chew on a bale of hay?

254
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,642
Okay. My God, we gotta go back
and get them!

255
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,605
Are you seriously
ever gonna wear the boots again?

256
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:51,903
Okay, I'll never wear them again.
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

257
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,822
Know what? You can say goodbye
to the tan ones.

258
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,911
- Okay. All right. Unh.
- Okay.

259
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,665
Bye, boots. Wait! Half off!

260
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,836
Joey, because they're not
getting married...

261
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,838
...doesn't mean this is a disaster.

262
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:15,968
- Maybe they have a plan.
- Oh. Oh! Okay, let's hear their plan.

263
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,305
What's the future look like
for Dina and Bobby?

264
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:24,602
Well, I really have high hopes
for my band.

265
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:29,232
You were right. He is funny.

266
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:33,820
Wait! I bet when you told people
you wanted to act, they laughed at you.

267
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,948
Bobby, tell us a little
about your band.

268
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:42,120
It's just me and my pal, Rooster.
The band's name is Numbnuts.

269
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:46,999
Really?

270
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,921
Dina, if you're having a baby,
you should be married.

271
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,967
Even if it is to Bobby.
Dude, that's not a compliment.

272
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:01,139
- I knew you wouldn't be supportive.
- What are you gonna do?

273
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:05,226
You're gonna have the baby and raise it
by yourself, without a husband?

274
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:09,313
You can't be a single mother alone!
You're gonna ruin your life!

275
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,985
- Excuse me. Am I ruining my life?
- No, no, it's different for you.

276
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,528
You're strong and together.

277
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,406
You're not some dumb kid
who doesn't know what she's doing.

278
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:23,286
- Excuse me?
- One pregnant woman at a time, please!

279
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,123
I just want you to be okay.

280
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,876
Forcing her to marry Bobby
is gonna make that happen?

281
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,128
Maybe.

282
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,967
Yeah. So, uh, what kind of music
does Numbnuts...?

283
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,803
Ah, forget it! I can't!

284
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,764
Joey, I am scared to death
about this.

285
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,642
But I think I can do it.
I just need some help.

286
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,771
- And Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.
- You bet I am.

287
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:55,943
To answer your earlier question,
we're straight-up gangster rap.

288
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,284
Rachel's told me how much easier
you've made this on her.

289
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,455
- Why can't you do that for me?
- Because!

290
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,582
Because you're my baby sister!

291
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,250
And you're my big brother.

292
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,670
I mean, you're my favorite guy
in the whole world.

293
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:20,426
I'm not even scared to tell Mom
and Dad. I was scared of telling you.

294
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:24,138
I'd be scared of them, but all right.

295
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:28,809
I can't stand the thought of
having this baby with you mad at me.

296
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,938
I want him to have his uncle.

297
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,523
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?

298
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,655
Of course he's gonna have
his Uncle Joey.

299
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:47,495
We'll be all right. Even if we're not
married, this baby is gonna be so loved.

300
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,915
- And not just by us.
- That's right.

301
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:56,712
- By his uncle too.
- And by you.

302
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:04,887
Okay, Bobby, come over here and let them
have a little moment, okay?

303
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,102
Come here!

304
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,106
No, seriously, what's wrong with you?

305
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:24,031
You're gonna love me so much.
I got Sting tickets!

306
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:27,952
Oh, my God, I do love you!
How did you do it?

307
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,121
Well, let's just say:

308
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,416
Ross can!

309
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,084
Ohh!

310
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,378
- Where are the seats?
- Middle balcony.

311
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,964
Would you say that that's
more than 50 yards away...

312
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,926
...from Sting, his wife,
or a member of his family?

313
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,970
- Yeah.
