1
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:08,424
Okay, she is the star of the play,
and she is my girlfriend.

2
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:11,301
I get to have sex
with the star of the play.

3
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:14,221
- People can hear you.
- I know.

4
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,356
- Wow, she looks great, doesn't she?
- Mm.

5
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,152
- Hi.
- Hi.

6
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:30,821
That is one good-looking man.

7
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:37,578
Is it just me, or can you actually
see his abs through his overcoat?

8
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:41,415
So, you been doing this long?

9
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,919
No. You're my first.
Put the money on the table.

10
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,798
Oh, yeah.

11
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,133
Ooh, that's nice.

12
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,846
Dude.

13
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,853
- Is that an expensive blouse?
- If you want it to be.

14
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,235
Here's your girlfriend's button.

15
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:06,375
Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have, like, your
old blouses and dresses from high school?

16
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,545
Yeah, I think I have some
around here somewhere. Why?

17
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,880
Well, it's just maternity clothes
are so expensive.

18
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,636
Hey, Rach, I made a pile
of your stuff on this side of your room.

19
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,471
- If you could just...
- Ugh!

20
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,516
- Throw your purses at it.

21
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,394
Bloomingdale's eliminated
my department.

22
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:30,315
- Oh, my God. Are you out of a job?
- No, they stuck me in Personal Shopping...

23
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,693
...which is just a huge step down.

24
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,153
Personal Shopping, what is that?

25
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,572
Like where you walk around
with snooty rich people...

26
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,407
...and tell them what to buy?

27
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,869
- Uh-huh.
- That sounds great.

28
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,538
Hey.

29
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,125
Um, excuse me, we switched apartments.

30
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,044
You can't eat our food anymore.
That gravy train has ended.

31
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,921
There's gravy?

32
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,467
If you have the big apartment, then deal
with people coming over all the time.

33
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,721
That fridge has got to be stocked, okay?
That's your apartment now.

34
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:08,061
- What are you doing?
- I think I left a doughnut up here.

35
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,734
- Hey.
- Hey.

36
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,736
Oh, how was Kathy's play?

37
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,031
Well, Kathy gets half-naked
and simulates sex...

38
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,909
...with a real good-looking guy.

39
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,953
Yeah, it was like somebody
wrote down my worst nightmare...

40
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:28,040
...and then charged me $32 to see it.

41
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,293
That's a good idea for a business.

42
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:35,464
I'm totally screwed, okay? They're gonna be
hot and heavy on-stage every night...

43
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:39,468
...and then they're gonna go to their
cast parties, and he's gonna undermine me.

44
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:43,138
You know, he'll be like, "So where's your
boyfriend? What's his name, Chester?"

45
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:47,726
And she'll go, "No, no, no. It's Chandler."
He'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha."

46
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,021
That is a good trick.

47
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,651
All right, look, look.
What am I gonna do?

48
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,820
Chandler, look, they're actors.
They're there to do a job.

49
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,615
Just because they work together
doesn't mean they'll get together.

50
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,493
Just because it happened
with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins...

51
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,578
...doesn't mean it's gonna happen
with them.

52
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,915
Oh, oh. Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.

53
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,125
- Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
- Yeah.

54
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,754
Okay, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.

55
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,299
They're not a couple.

56
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,260
Oh, okay, I get the game now.

57
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,180
Okay, look, look.
Let me ask you a question.

58
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,683
When they were doing it on-stage,
was it like really hot?

59
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,810
Huh. Oh, yeah.

60
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,313
Well, okay, so then you're fine.

61
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:37,776
Look, the rule is when two actors
are actually doing it off-stage...

62
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,280
...then all the sexual tension
between them is gone.

63
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:45,701
Okay? So as long as it's hot on-stage,
you got nothing to worry about.

64
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,537
It's when the heat goes away,
that's when you're in trouble.

65
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:50,998
Really?

66
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,958
You guys have been to every play
I've been in.

67
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,751
Have I ever had chemistry on-stage?

68
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,545
- No.
- No.

69
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,552
So, uh, man, are you gonna go see the play
with me tonight?

70
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,971
You know what? I don't know
how comfortable I am...

71
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,558
...going to see how hot the sex is
between some guy and your girlfriend.

72
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,269
- Yeah, I know...
- No, no, no, oh, I'm there.

73
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,814
- Hey.
- Hey, Mon.

74
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,150
- Want some pancakes?
- You made pancakes?

75
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,110
Yep. Grab a plate.

76
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,780
No, no. Stay right there.

77
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,784
Getting closer.

78
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,620
Don't worry...

79
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,749
...we also have cereals,
muffins, waffles...

80
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:38,378
...and jams, jellies and marmalades,
which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.

81
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,674
Also we're watching the game here
Saturday, if people want to come over.

82
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,925
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh.

83
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,136
I was having people over for the game.

84
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,305
Oh, yeah? Who's playing?

85
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,017
The players.

86
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,938
Somebody seems to be missing
being the hostess.

87
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:02,444
Ha, ha. Please, it's a relief,
is what it is, is what it is.

88
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,863
All right. Pheebs, stick out your plate.

89
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,114
Oh.

90
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,247
Monica, I'm quitting.

91
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:18,710
I just helped an 81 -year-old woman put on
a thong, and she didn't even buy it.

92
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,672
I'm telling you, I'm quitting, that's it.
I'm talking to my boss right now.

93
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,926
Yes, I am. Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

94
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,345
Okay, bye.
Call me when you get this message.

95
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,474
Oh! Mr. Waltham?
I, uh, really need to talk to you.

96
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,185
In a moment, please.
I'm in the middle of a task.

97
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,686
And you have a customer.

98
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,317
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Joshua.

99
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,779
Hi, I'm Rachel Green.
What can I do for you, Joshua?

100
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:50,951
Well, I need a new wardrobe. My wife...
Well, my ex-wife...

101
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,495
Oh, I'm so sorry.

102
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,293
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes.

103
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:05,424
So I got away with two things: This suit
and what turned out to be a, uh, skirt. Heh.

104
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,552
Well, at least that's a great suit.

105
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:12,347
Yeah, it wasn't much fun dropping it off
at the dry cleaners in the skirt.

106
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,017
So I need everything down to underwear.

107
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:19,312
So if you're willing, I'm, uh...
I'm all yours.

108
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,815
Okay.

109
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,775
Rachel, you needed to speak to me?

110
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,777
No, no, that wasn't me.

111
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:31,408
Well, we should get started.
Let me show you my underwear.

112
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,288
The selection of underwear
that we carry.

113
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,879
- Oh, I'm sorry. It's this way.
- It's this way? Sorry.

114
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,380
Oh.

115
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,345
I'm right, right? There was, like,
no chemistry between them.

116
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,639
Before, they had heat.
And now there's no heat.

117
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,060
Now, you know what this means.
Joey told us what this means.

118
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,104
Let's not jump to any conclusions,
all right?

119
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,065
There was some sexual chemistry
between them.

120
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,443
Oh, come on.
It was like cousins having sex up there.

121
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:13,909
Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay?
Just be cool. Don't be, you know, you.

122
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,038
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.

123
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,790
Oh, thank you so much
for coming again.

124
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,792
- Did you like it tonight?
- Absolutely.

125
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,461
Mm.

126
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,088
Wasn't Nick funny when
he couldn't get his match lit?

127
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,632
Mm!

128
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,596
- It's a good play, isn't it?
- Mm.

129
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,016
I loved the play.
Uh, yeah, you were great.

130
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,977
And, uh, Nick, ditto.

131
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,314
Clearly, you're having sex with him.

132
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,944
Okay.

133
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,534
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?

134
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,495
Oh, come on. It was so obvious.
There was no chemistry between you two.

135
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,414
Okay, let me just get this straight.

136
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:05,293
You're accusing me of cheating on you,
and you're insulting my performance?

137
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,170
You know,
I can see how this could happen.

138
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,382
You know, you're up there every night,
naked, touching, kissing.

139
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,635
Acting. Chandler, this is my job.

140
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,222
I'm playing a part in a play.
How can you not trust me?

141
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,684
Well, you can understand,
given how we started.

142
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,310
Oh, wow.

143
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,688
I can't believe you're throwing that
in my face.

144
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,983
Well, that is what happened,
and I don't even see you denying this.

145
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,028
I'll tell you what, Chandler.
Why don't you call me when you grow up?

146
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:35,323
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen
any time soon.

147
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,373
Oh, I have the best job
in the entire world.

148
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,292
The most adorable guy
came over today...

149
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,378
...and I got to dress him up all day.

150
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,256
Rachel has a new doll.

151
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,677
Oh, I wish he was a doll. Then I could get
a Rachel doll and bump them together...

152
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,554
...and make kissing noises.

153
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:02,767
Oh, and he's got the most beautiful name.
I never realized. Joshua.

154
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,186
Oh, Joshua.

155
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,606
Joshua, Josh.

156
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,232
Uh, hello?

157
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,817
Hi.

158
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,571
Ooh, what do I smell?

159
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,948
I don't know, but it smells good.

160
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,999
- Fresh cookies. Hot from the oven.
- Ooh!

161
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,209
- Please have some.
- Oh, yo.

162
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:32,088
I've just been fiddling around in here,
making delicious treats for everyone.

163
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,758
Wow. The new Playboy.

164
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,718
Yeah, just something I picked up.

165
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:40,055
Cookies and porn?
You're the best mom ever.

166
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,103
What? What?

167
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:52,233
Nothing, it's just something Joshua said
about V-necks, but you had to be there.

168
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,736
How does, uh, Jason look in a V-neck?

169
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,238
- It's Joshua.
- Oh, whatever.

170
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,161
Wait. Wait. This isn't takeout.

171
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,122
- Well, hate to eat and run.
- No, wait, please don't go.

172
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,625
I've got porn for you too.

173
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,543
Yeah, I don't need it.

174
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,214
People are supposed
to want to hang out here.

175
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,257
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?

176
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,677
I'm the hostess.

177
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,846
Not those guys. I'm always the hostess.

178
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,892
I mean, even when I was little, the girls
brought their dollies to my tea party.

179
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,644
I served the best air.

180
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,106
Why did you make a whole big thing...

181
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,650
...out of everyone has to hang out
in the big apartment?

182
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,611
Because they took our apartment.
I wanted to punish them.

183
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,989
But I'm done now.
They've suffered enough.

184
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,577
If you wanted to punish them, you
should have just made them hang out here.

185
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,079
That's true.

186
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,124
All right, this place will be 10 times better
than that place.

187
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,501
Oh, are we gonna trash their place?

188
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,796
Steps.

189
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,550
Slut.

190
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:07,726
You'll all be very happy to hear
that Kathy is sleeping with that guy.

191
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,561
- What?
- So you were right?

192
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,481
I confronted her, and she didn't deny it.

193
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,484
I don't live here.

194
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,406
- Chandler.
- Chandler, what did she say?

195
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,782
Wait, are you sure?

196
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,702
Well, I may be drunk,
but I know what she said.

197
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,788
So then I went over
to Beefsteak Chewley's...

198
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,084
- Beefsteak Charlie's?
- Yes.

199
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,503
See, you and I have always been like:

200
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,769
Oops.

201
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,522
- Hey, do you need help with that?
- No, I got it.

202
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,693
Oh, I just feel bad. I never vacuum.

203
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,363
- Hey.
- Hey.

204
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:07,410
So I was with Joshua for an hour today,
and he has not asked me out.

205
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,246
- It's so frustrating.
- Why don't you ask him out?

206
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,832
Oh, yeah. Totally. That's such a turn-on.

207
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,502
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?

208
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,129
Ooh, that's the turn-on.

209
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,509
He just got a divorce, right? So he's
probably really nervous around women.

210
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,094
You know? Maybe you just need
to make the first move.

211
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:29,015
- I've never asked a guy out before.
- You've never asked a guy out?

212
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,266
No, have you?

213
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,477
Thousands of times. Ha, ha.

214
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,065
That doesn't make me
sound too good, does it?

215
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,567
I don't even know
how I would go about it.

216
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:43,446
Oh, what I do is, uh, I look a woman
up and down and I say:

217
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,989
"Hey.

218
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,450
How you doing?"

219
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,120
Oh, please.

220
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,413
Hey.

221
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,332
How you doing?

222
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,505
You know what? I'm gonna do that.

223
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,132
I'm gonna call him up
and I'm gonna ask him out.

224
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,886
- Yeah.
- I can do that. Ask him out.

225
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,847
"How you doing?"

226
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,393
Hi, Joshua?

227
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,145
It's Rachel Green, from Bloomingdale's.

228
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:19,524
Yeah, um, I was just wondering
if you, um...

229
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,277
If you, um...

230
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,948
Left your wallet at the store today?

231
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:31,077
Oh, well, we found a wallet, and we...

232
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:35,331
The license? Oh, that is a good idea.

233
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:39,419
Uh, well, let's see.
This license belongs to a, uh...

234
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:44,173
Uh, belongs to a Mr. Pheebs.

235
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,802
And, um, yeah.

236
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,807
So okay. So sorry to bother you at home.
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

237
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,562
- You've done that a thousand times?
- I've never done that.

238
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,107
Oh, God, I just got so nervous
that he was gonna say no.

239
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:06,029
Well, you gotta give him something
he can't say no to, like, uh, Knicks tickets.

240
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,823
Invite the guy to a Knicks game.
You're guaranteed he'll say yes.

241
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,076
- Really? You think that will work?
- Absolutely, and if doesn't, can I go?

242
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,539
- What the heck is that?
- What is that?

243
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,054
Did she call?

244
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,265
No. Sorry.

245
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,727
- Well, maybe I should call her.
- No.

246
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,313
Forget her, man. You don't need her.
Don't need that.

247
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,024
He's right.
What she did was unforgivable.

248
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,110
Well, yeah, but you know,
what if I was wrong?

249
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,987
How might you be wrong?

250
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,782
Well, you know, what if she didn't
actually sleep with the guy?

251
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,117
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.

252
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,245
She did not have to tell me.
I saw the play and there was no heat.

253
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,706
- Back me up here, Ross.
- That's all your basing this on?

254
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,792
That's not backing me up.

255
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,127
You said, you know,
with the off-stage and the heat...

256
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,171
...and the on-stage and the heat...
- Whoa, whoa.

257
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,175
That was just a theory.
There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out.

258
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:13,721
Lone gunman, communism, geometry.

259
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,599
Oh, my God.

260
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,397
"Would you like to go
to a basketball game with..."

261
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,734
"You know, it's funny, basketball,
because I happen to have tickets to..."

262
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,570
No. Okay. Um...

263
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,282
"Who likes the Knicks?"

264
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,579
- What do you think?
- Oh.

265
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:43,459
Well, as a single woman,
who is available...

266
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,004
...I think you look great.

267
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,673
- Huh. Yeah?
- Yup.

268
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,426
Oh, yeah, you look great.

269
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,891
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this looks great.

270
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,853
Um, so you like it?

271
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,314
I do, I do. I love it.
In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.

272
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:09,610
- Great.
- Well, thank you so much for all your help.

273
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,489
- Well, I guess, uh... I guess this is it.
- Yeah.

274
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,991
Thanks.

275
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,994
Maybe I'll see you in the spring
with the... For the bathing suits.

276
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,288
You don't want to do that now?

277
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,957
Oh, that's okay.

278
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,084
Anyway,
hopefully I'll see you around sometime.

279
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,128
Basketball.

280
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,672
Sorry?

281
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,132
I, uh...

282
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,761
I have two tickets to the Knicks game
tonight if you're interested...

283
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,430
...just as a thank-you for this week.

284
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,350
Wow. That would be great.

285
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,603
- Really?
- Yeah, That would be fantastic.

286
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:47,231
My nephew is crazy about the Knicks.

287
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:52,195
This is fantastic.
Thank you so much, Rachel.

288
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,197
- Good morning.
- Hi.

289
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,740
Oh.

290
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,290
- Hey.
- Hey.

291
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,336
I just wanted to come over
to say that I'm sorry.

292
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,380
You know, I acted like the biggest idiot
in the world.

293
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,133
And I can completely understand
why you were so upset.

294
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,177
Oh, wow.

295
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,721
I really wish you'd called me.

296
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,598
Yeah, I know. I wish I had too.

297
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,227
But, you know,
I think this is a good thing. You know?

298
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,938
Because we've had our first fight,
and now we can move on.

299
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,066
You know, I mean, I know for me, but...

300
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,241
Nick's pants?

301
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,951
Yeah.

302
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,078
Yeah. Well.

303
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,249
I think our second fight
is going to be a big one.

304
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,925
- Okay, for next time, what do you say?
- "I have an extra ticket."

305
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,345
"An extra ticket." Not "two tickets."
I have and extra ticket.

306
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:05,434
So the first time you asked a guy out
he turned you down?

307
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,606
He didn't turn me down.
He's at the game, isn't he?

308
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,567
I got the date. I'm just not on it.

309
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,115
Okay, it's ready.

310
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,951
- Come on.
- What's ready?

311
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,786
Just come.

312
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,792
Oh, my God.

313
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,254
- Wow.
- Monica, this is beautiful.

314
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:37,175
Oh, did you work for two days straight?

315
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,468
Pretty much.

316
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,221
So, what do you think of the floor?

317
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,473
I don't know. Looks the same.

318
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,684
You used to have carpet.

319
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,519
Oh, yeah.

320
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,772
So I made snacks.

321
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,232
Please, just hang out, okay?

322
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,611
I'm just gonna rest my eyes
for just a little bit.

323
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,739
Mon, do you want us to come back later?

324
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:03,951
Oh, no, no, no. Stay, stay, stay.
Just keep talking.

325
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,121
I'm always the hostess.

326
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,708
- Hey.
- How'd it go?

327
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,127
- So?
- Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.

328
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,172
- Oh, good.
- She is now.

329
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:23,846
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that she is a devil woman.

330
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,723
You think you know a person...

331
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,226
...then they turn around
and they sleep with Nick.

332
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,729
Nick and his rock-hard pecs
and his giant man-nipples.

333
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,693
I hate him. And I hate her.

334
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:41,697
Well, I don't hate her. I love her.
This is all my fault, really.

335
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,200
- Oh.
- How? How is it your fault?

336
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,245
Because, ugh, I should have called.

337
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,831
You know, if I'd just called her, she never
would have gone out with Nick...

338
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,501
...and they wouldn't have ended up
in bed together.

339
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,878
I threw her at his man-nipples.

340
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,966
Honey, this is not your fault.

341
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:04,762
Just because you guys had a fight
does not justify her sleeping with someone.

342
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,517
Well, if she thought
they were on a break...

343
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,195
Rachel, one of your customers seems
to have left his billfold. A Joshua Burgen.

344
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,698
- Really?
- Will you call him?

345
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,909
Yes, I will. Absolutely.

346
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,038
Oh.

347
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,591
Hello, Rachel.

348
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,593
Hi, Joshua.

349
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,221
I left my wallet here on purpose.

350
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,639
Really?

351
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,142
Yes, I just wanted to see you again.

352
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,394
Oh, I'm glad.

353
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,772
Rachel, I'd like to say something to you.

354
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,399
Yes?

355
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,068
How you doing?
