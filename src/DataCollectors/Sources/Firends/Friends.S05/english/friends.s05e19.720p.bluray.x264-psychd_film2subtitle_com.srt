1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,044
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:06,755
Wow, you look nice.
What's the occasion?

3
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:09,508
Monica and I are celebrating
our 10-month anniversary.

4
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,593
- Got reservations at Jean-George.
- Wow.

5
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,178
- How'd you get in?
- Oh.

6
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,472
Made a few calls,
pulled some strings...

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,475
...and they'll seat us if we both
have chicken and don't get dessert.

8
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,773
- Hi, Chandler.
- Hey, Caitlin.

9
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,150
Somebody got a haircut.

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,777
Ugh. I hate it. I look like
an 8-year-old boy.

11
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,447
If that was true, gym class
would've been more interesting.

12
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,619
- It's, uh, $27 even.
- Oh, okay. Here you go.

13
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,080
Where's the chicken?

14
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:43,125
Oh, it's in the back.
The duck pissed him off.

15
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,793
He said that eggs came first.

16
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:48,088
- Ha, ha, thanks. I'll see you later.
- Okay. Bye.

17
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,802
What the hell was that?

18
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,013
- What?
- The flirting.

19
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,725
Aren't you supposed to be going out
with, hmm, let's see, my sister?

20
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,769
I was not flirting.

21
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:05,189
It was totally flirting!
"Somebody got a haircut..."

22
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,653
First of all, the impression? Uncanny.

23
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:16,325
Second, that wasn't flirting. That was just
casual conversation between two people.

24
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,160
Oh! Yeah, right.

25
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,621
You wanna see flirting?
I'll show you flirting.

26
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,749
I'm good. I'm okay.

27
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,511
I am so proud of Joey.

28
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,805
- He's gonna be on Law and Order!
- I know.

29
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:23,809
But don't you think it should
be called Order and Law?

30
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,311
No, because they arrest the guy
and then try him.

31
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,230
Yeah. Don't get me started on that.

32
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,193
- I was not flirting.
- And on your anniversary. For shame!

33
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:34,945
What's going on?

34
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,406
Chandler was hitting on
the hot delivery girl.

35
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:40,826
I was not. And oh, God! Shh!

36
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,788
I'm sorry, but you were. And besides,
if anyone should be hitting on her...

37
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,456
...it's the guy who's single...

38
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,750
...the guy who can do something about it.

39
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,962
Sounds like someone wants to be
Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.

40
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,214
Well...

41
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,925
Is that what this is about?
You like Caitlin?

42
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:03,599
Ha, ha, Ross, we broke up two years
ago. You've been married since then.

43
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,226
I think it's okay
that we see other people.

44
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,939
- I was watching her at the pizza place.
- Mm-hm.

45
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:15,861
And she was just so sexy and funny
and has the cutest little...

46
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,030
We don't need her measurements.
Ha, ha.

47
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,450
Pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni.

48
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,286
I know she's pretty and you love her,
but is she stupid?

49
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,623
She forgot my vegetarian.

50
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:32,211
This is perfect. She'll have
to come back here with your pizza.

51
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,881
And when she does,
I will turn on the charm "au" Ross.

52
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,093
Oh, I am so glad you don't eat meat.
Ha, ha.

53
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,805
- See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
- Mm.

54
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,558
Hey, everybody, look who's here!
You remember my grandmother.

55
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,229
- Big night!
- Yeah, it's so cool.

56
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,648
Joey on Law and Order.
You must be very proud.

57
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,525
Chandler, she doesn't understand
a word of English.

58
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,195
Ha, ha, I thought you were
Joey's other grandmother.

59
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,074
I've done it again.

60
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,119
Nonnie's my biggest fan.

61
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,830
She's the only one in the family
who's always believed in me.

62
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,460
Big star.

63
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,797
My big fat Joey star.

64
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,342
Yeah. Yeah.

65
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,887
Yeah, I weighed, like,
27 pounds when I was born.

66
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,474
Hey.

67
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,102
- Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary, 10 months.

68
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,521
- Oh! Mm.
- Mm.

69
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,108
Um, in the shower I was thinking
about our first night in London.

70
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,485
Oh, uh, Joey's grandmother's
right there.

71
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,196
- The one who speaks English?
- The one who doesn't.

72
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,533
That was some hot love you gave me.
Ha-ha-ha.

73
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,202
- I'll get ready.
- Wear those earrings I got you.

74
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,539
Oh, that's a great idea. I was saving
them for something special.

75
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,291
Mm.

76
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,586
- You've got to go home.
- But I like it here.

77
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,841
Go home and get the earrings you borrowed.
He wants me to wear them.

78
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,386
I think they're in my purse.
Go get dressed and I'll look for them.

79
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,846
Okay.

80
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,057
Ahem, Rach. Hi.

81
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,851
I need those earrings you borrowed.

82
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,604
Oh. Um...

83
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:15,814
- Okay.
- Okay.

84
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,066
- Yeah, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

85
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,077
Wow, Pheebs, you speak Italian?

86
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,412
I guess so.

87
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,960
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Wait, where's the other one?

88
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,172
Oh, what, you want both of them? Ha, ha.

89
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,050
Rachel Karen Green,
where's the other earring?

90
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,261
Okay, okay. Look, just don't freak out,
but I kind of lost it.

91
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,973
Oh, I know it's in the apartment,
but I definitely lost it.

92
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,518
What'll I tell Monica?
She wants to wear them tonight.

93
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:57,147
- Tell her to wear her own earrings.
- These are her earrings.

94
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,483
No. No.

95
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,570
You lent me Monica's earrings?
I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff.

96
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,324
- Why not?
- Because I lose her stuff!

97
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,248
He, uh, left a little after 2.

98
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:19,127
You see that blind guy right there?
I'm gonna bash his head in later.

99
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:25,342
Oh, uh, my big scene's coming up.
Uh, the big scene coming up.

100
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:29,012
If you said, "Big lima bean bubbling up,"
would she know the difference?

101
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,517
Rach, what are you doing?

102
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:37,020
Oh, I just can't watch. It's too scary.

103
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,731
- Huh.
- It's a diaper commercial.

104
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,735
Oh, yeah, well, you know me.
Babies, responsibilities...

105
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,826
- Pizza delivery.
- I'll get it! I will get that!

106
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,746
- Hi.
- Hi.

107
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:58,250
- One vegetarian pizza. It's 12.50.
- Ah.

108
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:02,295
Uh, by the way, if it makes
you feel any better, uh...

109
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,756
...I happen to like 8-year-old boys.

110
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,095
What?

111
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,473
Oh, I mean... No, no, no. The, uh...

112
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,975
Your hair. Before. Your hair.

113
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,562
You said you thought your hair
looked like an 8-year-old boy's...

114
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,606
...and I'm just saying I like it.

115
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,358
The hair.

116
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,028
Oh. Thanks.

117
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,118
You understand, I don't actually
like 8-year-old boys.

118
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,330
All I'm looking for is the money.

119
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,208
Here you go.
Now, stop bringing us pizzas, you.

120
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,794
- I'm gonna try. Ha, ha.
- Okay.

121
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,590
You're welcome.

122
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,092
You couldn't let me have her,
could you?

123
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,386
- What?
- This is a girl I really like...

124
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:55,474
...and you had to swoop in there!
- What's going on?

125
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,477
Chandler was flirting
with the hot delivery girl.

126
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,563
Thank you for that.

127
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,941
I was not flirting.

128
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,027
It's okay. I don't care. Ha, ha. It's fine.

129
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,321
- Really?
- Really?

130
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,615
It's no big deal. I do it all the time.

131
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,996
So, uh... Ahem.
You flirt with guys all the time?

132
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:22,792
Sure. It doesn't mean anything. Just like
I know it doesn't mean anything with you.

133
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,420
But there's a big difference.
You're a lot hotter.

134
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,005
True story.

135
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,008
Ha, ha. This actually bothers you?

136
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,761
Yes, and I think
it'd bother a lot of people.

137
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:37,057
When you were going out with Ross, did it
bother you when he flirted with other women?

138
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:41,478
Uh, no. No, it bothered me when
he slept with other women.

139
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,067
And thank you for that.

140
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,111
But I never had anything to worry about.

141
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,531
Ross was never very good
at the flirting thing.

142
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,408
What...? What...? Ha, ha.

143
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,620
What are you talking about?
It worked with you.

144
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,871
Oh. No, you're right.

145
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:04,709
We met, you flirted and then,
bam, nine years later, you had me.

146
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,337
All right. All right.

147
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,465
You know what I'm gonna do?
I am gonna order another pizza.

148
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,759
And when Caitlin gets here...

149
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,845
...I will show you how well I flirt.

150
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,181
- I will get her phone number.
- Oh, well...

151
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,850
And not the one on the menu.

152
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,314
- I found it.
- Oh, thank God! Where was it?

153
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,524
On your dresser.

154
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:31,069
- Okay, that is the one we already have.
- Oh.

155
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,738
Okay, here's my big scene.
My big scene's here.

156
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:37,450
- What do you bet nobody heard anything?
- No bet.

157
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,828
Anybody home?

158
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,247
- Oh, my God.
- What?

159
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:46,751
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill
my grandmother if she finds out. Ha, ha.

160
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:50,171
- Oh, what is it?
- Uh, they cut me out of the show.

161
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,173
What?

162
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,801
- Are you sure?
- Maybe your scene's coming up.

163
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,263
Not likely. Because you see
that body bag right there?

164
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,764
- Yeah.
- I'm in it.

165
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,355
This is terrible. What'll you do?

166
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,859
I don't know. But this little old lady
lives for my career.

167
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,903
When they dumped me off
Days of Our Lives, she almost died.

168
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,614
That's not good.

169
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:19,075
You're not smiling. Not that face!
Smile, everybody smile! Ha, ha.

170
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,288
Why don't you just tell her what happened?
It's not your fault.

171
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:27,167
If we keep talking this way,
aren't we gonna freak her out soon?

172
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,672
Oh, uh, soon. I'm gonna be on soon.

173
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,549
There I am!

174
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,760
No.

175
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,803
Sam Waterston!

176
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,139
Oh, no, no. That's me. That's me!

177
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,516
No. Sam Waterston.

178
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,561
Crime Misdemeanor, Capricorn One.

179
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,898
She doesn't know "hello,"
but she knows Capricorn One.

180
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,067
- Phoebe.
- Hmm?

181
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,736
I need those earrings.
We're leaving when the show's over.

182
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,031
But I already gave them back to you.

183
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,201
No, you didn't.

184
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,954
All right, I already didn't gave them
back to you. That's what I said.

185
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,124
Ahem. Where's that other earring?

186
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,127
It's not here, Pheebs. It's not here. Oh!

187
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,671
I went to Chandler's last night.

188
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,340
Make sure you check
Chandler's jewelry box.

189
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,636
Wait a minute, Chandler has a jewelry box?

190
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,348
Okay, we have 10 minutes.
Do you want me to get into that now?

191
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,063
Hey, Pheebs.

192
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,856
How's that, uh...

193
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,318
...vegetarian pizza
working out for you, huh?

194
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,906
You and those, uh, vegetables
have a real, uh...

195
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,409
...thing going on, huh?

196
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,996
Why are you being weird?

197
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,916
Do you like it?

198
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,920
No. That would be,
"Why are you being cute?"

199
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,298
Okay. I'm working on my flirting.

200
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,759
Oh! I did not get that.

201
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,180
So, uh, Monica, do you like
Law and Order?

202
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,640
- Yeah, it's good.
- Oh.

203
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,810
I found out all this stuff about you.
You like Law and Order...

204
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,396
...and you've flirted with every guy
in the tri-state area.

205
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,440
Shh. Shh.

206
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,735
Okay, let me get this straight.

207
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,821
It's okay for you to flirt, but not for me?

208
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,823
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up.

209
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,411
Look, I'm sorry, but some things
are different for men and women.

210
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,413
Go on, teach me about men and women.

211
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,583
Okay. I've already taught you
so much already, but whatever.

212
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,545
When you flirt with a guy,
you think, "No big deal."

213
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,382
But the guy thinks, "Finally!
Somebody who wants to sleep with me."

214
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,593
- No way!
- It's true.

215
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,763
- Well, that's pathetic.
- Again, true.

216
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,933
- This goes for all guys?
- All guys that are awake.

217
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,769
Then we go to sleep.

218
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,981
All guys from the other end of the world
wake up and behave the exact same way.

219
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,194
All right. It's another commercial
and I still haven't told her.

220
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:02,238
Joey, this is the last commercial.

221
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,407
- You got, like, 10 minutes left.
- I know!

222
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,534
What am I gonna do? Oh!

223
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,037
You are not gonna run out
and leave her here.

224
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,083
Yeah, all right. Oh!

225
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,838
Joey?

226
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:23,218
Uh, Joey's gonna be right back.
Right back?

227
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,013
Meanwhile, let's talk about you.

228
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,601
So, you're old and small.

229
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,818
- Hey.
- Did you find it?

230
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,237
The earring, no.
But I found my sunglasses.

231
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,198
I've been looking for these
since last summer.

232
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,368
Those are my sunglasses.
You borrowed them from me.

233
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,330
Okay. Calm down. Here they are.

234
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,457
Phoebe.

235
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,837
- What do we do?
- I don't know. I don't know!

236
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,841
We'll just have to tell Monica, that's all.

237
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,052
Oh, God! She's gonna kill me.

238
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,972
- Oh.
- I could tell her it was all my fault.

239
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,765
Oh, that'd be great.

240
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,270
Mon, could I talk to you?

241
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:18,273
- Yeah. What is it?
- Um...

242
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,483
I lost one of your earrings.

243
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,528
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.

244
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,530
Wow.

245
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,660
All right, well, I mean, what can you do?
If you lost it, you lost it.

246
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,204
I'll replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.

247
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,498
That's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.

248
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,875
- No.
- Oh.

249
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,002
Look at you. Come here.

250
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,712
Aw.

251
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,966
- You feel better? Ha, ha.
- Yeah. You're the best.

252
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,385
Okay, wait a minute.

253
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,221
Wait a minute, I can't do this.

254
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,724
Listen, honey, it's not Phoebe's fault.

255
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,684
She lent me the earrings.

256
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,438
I lost it. I'm so sorry, honey.
I feel terrible too.

257
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,400
That is exactly why
I do not lend you stuff!

258
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,655
First it's my jewelry.
If it's not that, it's my sweater.

259
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,199
And if it's not my sweater,
it's my sunglasses.

260
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,368
- Your sunglasses?
- Yes.

261
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,995
Oh, right.

262
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,124
- Pizza.
- Mine, mine, mine!

263
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,752
Okay, here goes.

264
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,172
Prepare yourselves
for some class-A flirting.

265
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,090
Okay, hold on.

266
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,634
Okay.

267
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:33,473
If you really like this girl,
I don't think flirting is the right way...

268
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,266
Ah! Ah! Ah!

269
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,226
You'll see.

270
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,770
Okay.

271
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,607
Oh, what's her name?

272
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,942
Caitlin!

273
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,110
Caitlin.

274
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,493
Hey.

275
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,204
Oh, we can't keep eating like this.
Ha, ha.

276
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,833
Heh. It's, uh, $12.50.

277
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,627
Okay, um...

278
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,754
So...

279
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,552
Do you make the pizzas in one
of those, uh, wood-burning ovens?

280
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,015
No, actually, I think they're gas.

281
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,601
Gas? Wow, ha, ha.

282
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,646
Intense.

283
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,818
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt,
we don't have a problem.

284
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,654
Hey, uh...

285
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,407
You know that smell gas has?

286
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,287
Yeah.

287
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,331
They put that in.

288
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,125
What?

289
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,377
The gas is odorless.

290
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:49,465
But they add the smell
so you know when there's a leak.

291
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,385
Well, okay.

292
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,432
A lot of other gas smells.

293
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,397
Oh, the humanity.

294
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,903
Methane smells...

295
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,158
You know what?
Um, actually, I really should go.

296
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,327
- Oh, but I haven't paid you yet.
- That's okay.

297
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,581
You guys have ordered so many
that this one's on me.

298
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,958
Last I heard...

299
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,837
...the cops had over 600
reported missing women still.

300
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,047
Six hundred.

301
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:33,301
Was I talking to her about gas?

302
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,929
More so than anything else.

303
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,350
I found it interesting.

304
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,812
I'm sorry.

305
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,148
Hey, hey. Don't worry about it.

306
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,819
In nine years, she and I
will be right there! Ha, ha.

307
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,745
Okay. Well, I'm gonna clear out
some of these boxes.

308
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,461
- Ross?
- Yeah?

309
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,214
What else do they add smell to?

310
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,887
Caitlin! Caitlin! Hi.

311
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,348
Hi, I'm Rachel. Oh.

312
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,475
From upstairs, people with all the pizza.

313
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,143
Oh, was there a problem?

314
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,354
No, they're fine. Great pizza.

315
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,524
But, actually, um, my friend Ross...

316
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:33,569
...he just gets really nervous
when he's flirting.

317
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,614
Oh, my God! That was flirting?

318
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,241
- Yeah.
- Wow.

319
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,284
I know, I know.

320
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,704
I'm telling you,
once you get past that part...

321
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,332
...where it just feels like you wanna die...

322
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,501
...he's a really good person.

323
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,295
- The guy with the gas?
- Yeah.

324
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,590
I'm telling you, he's really
sweet and really funny...

325
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,051
...and he's just, oh, got a good heart.

326
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:01,347
- And besides, I think he really likes you.
- Really?

327
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:05,518
Well, we have seven people
and 10 pizzas. What do you think?

328
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,521
I thought Joey was there.

329
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,442
You've got till Monday.
Then I move to dismiss.

330
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,405
Hey, Ross?

331
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,992
Um, I just ran into Caitlin
in the hallway.

332
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,996
Uh, you must be getting better at
this flirting stuff than I thought. Ha, ha.

333
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,581
- What?
- I don't get it...

334
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,542
...but she wanted me
to give you her phone number.

335
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,169
Oh.

336
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,465
And she just gave you this?

337
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,009
Yeah.

338
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,431
Rach, thanks. But I don't need
you doing me any favors.

339
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,100
I didn't. I didn't. She thought you were cute.

340
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,686
Well, that I can believe.

341
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,730
Yeah.

342
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,983
Hey, is the show still on?

343
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,526
Almost over, man.

344
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,069
Hey, Nonnie.

345
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,529
Oh! Is that the Pope?

346
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,822
Hey.

347
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,951
Why am I looking?

348
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,621
Oh, Nonnie, here I am!
This is my big scene.

349
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,165
All right, back off!

350
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,919
I got a gun!

351
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,837
I'm not afraid to use it.

352
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,088
Oh, Joey.

353
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,715
That's right, Nonnie.

354
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,468
You couldn't have at least
changed your shirt?

355
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,722
Now, I want a suitcase
filled with $100,000...

356
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,767
Shh! Shoo, shoo!

357
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,187
Filled with $100,000 in small bills.

358
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,773
And if I don't get... Shoo!

359
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,234
And if I don't get it...

360
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,278
...I'm gonna shoot this duck!

361
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,697
Oh, no!

362
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,700
I'm coming out!

363
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,168
And she's supposed to buy this?

364
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,509
Ground control to Major Tom

365
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,638
Commencing countdown

366
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,723
Engines

367
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,850
On

368
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,859
That's, uh, scenes
from next week's show. Next week.

369
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,947
I am definitely gonna watch that.

370
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,454
What about these?
Do these look the same?

371
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,707
- Definitely.
- Not as each other.

372
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,667
Oh, then, no.

373
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,255
- Hey, you ready?
- Hi. Yeah.

374
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,798
- You look amazing.
- Aw.

375
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,758
I'm the luckiest man in the world.

376
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,594
- Oh, you're about to get a little luckier.
- Mm-hm.

377
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:48,472
- Let me see the earrings.
- Oh, right, the earrings.

378
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,224
They look great.

379
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,893
Does your boyfriend have
the best taste or what?

380
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,147
My boyfriend really does
have great taste.

381
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,988
- Thanks for picking out the earrings.
- Mm-hm.
