1
00:00:01,705 --> 00:00:05,453
Do you realize this is the
last time we'll be here...

2
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:07,225
...as six single people?

3
00:00:07,445 --> 00:00:10,399
What's happening to the coffeehouse?

4
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:17,604
From now on, it's you four
and me and the missus.

5
00:00:17,848 --> 00:00:21,323
The little woman. The wife.
The old ball and chain.

6
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:24,834
- Old?
- The young, hot ball and chain.

7
00:00:25,188 --> 00:00:27,620
- Much better.
- We gotta go.

8
00:00:27,798 --> 00:00:31,761
- Where?
- Get the dress and lunch with Mom.

9
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:33,846
Joey, you too?

10
00:00:34,095 --> 00:00:36,242
I just heard "lunch."

11
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,754
Yeah, I can go. Sure.

12
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:45,366
Actually, I'm glad they're leaving.

13
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:48,148
I need to talk to you
about something.

14
00:00:48,604 --> 00:00:51,450
- What's up?
- This may be a little awkward.

15
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,493
If you need money, it's a bad time.
I'm buying 128 dinners tomorrow.

16
00:00:57,093 --> 00:00:59,002
No, it's not that.

17
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,241
I'm not gonna say this
as your friend...

18
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,892
...but as Monica's older brother.

19
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:09,685
- But you're still my friend?
- Not for a few minutes.

20
00:01:09,897 --> 00:01:14,724
- Right now, are you still my best man?
- No.

21
00:01:15,915 --> 00:01:17,967
Do I still call you Ross?

22
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:25,296
You guys are getting married,
and I couldn't be more thrilled.

23
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:29,234
But as her older brother,
I have to tell you this:

24
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:34,661
If you ever hurt my little sister...

25
00:01:35,294 --> 00:01:40,537
...if you ever cause her
any unhappiness of any kind...

26
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:42,982
...I will hunt you down...

27
00:01:43,992 --> 00:01:45,937
...and kick your ass.

28
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:55,288
What? I'm serious.

29
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:02,252
- Dude! Stop it! I'm not kidding.
- I hear what you're saying...

30
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:05,204
...and thanks for the warning.

31
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,774
No problem.

32
00:02:07,512 --> 00:02:09,979
Are we friends again?

33
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:11,574
Yeah.

34
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:16,132
You won't believe what Monica's
brother just said to me!

35
00:02:17,358 --> 00:02:21,664
The One With Monica
and Chandler's Wedding

36
00:02:54,863 --> 00:02:56,286
What you doing, Mon?

37
00:02:56,498 --> 00:03:00,460
I'm listing things that
could go wrong at the wedding.

38
00:03:01,787 --> 00:03:03,934
So I can be prepared.

39
00:03:04,152 --> 00:03:08,636
- What are they?
- So far, the dresses won't get picked up...

40
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,218
...my veil gets lost
or I don't have something blue.

41
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:14,484
I'm responsible for all those.

42
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:17,888
I had to go with the odds.

43
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:23,215
Remember that audition I had a
while ago and I didn't get the part?

44
00:03:23,391 --> 00:03:25,265
- The commercial?
- That play?

45
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,317
That other play?

46
00:03:27,532 --> 00:03:29,335
- The movie?
- Yes!

47
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,910
The one about the dog
who flies planes?

48
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,115
No. But, man, that one hurt.

49
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:39,524
- This is the one about WWI soldiers.
- Oh, yeah.

50
00:03:39,814 --> 00:03:42,519
Back then we called it
"The Great War."

51
00:03:44,128 --> 00:03:45,717
It really was.

52
00:03:47,155 --> 00:03:50,974
The guy they wanted backed out!
I start shooting today!

53
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,258
Congratulations!

54
00:03:52,478 --> 00:03:55,989
- Today's the rehearsal dinner.
- I'll be done by then.

55
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,011
Oh. Then way to go,
you big movie star!

56
00:03:59,227 --> 00:04:01,801
See you. I'm off
to fight the Nazis.

57
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,529
Wait, Joey. We fought the Nazis
in WWll, not WWI.

58
00:04:09,108 --> 00:04:10,875
Who was in WWI?

59
00:04:14,048 --> 00:04:15,364
Go ahead.

60
00:04:15,857 --> 00:04:18,490
You're gonna be late!
Go! Go!

61
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,265
Who did we fight in WWI?

62
00:04:23,895 --> 00:04:26,183
- Mexico?
- Yes. Very good.

63
00:04:42,057 --> 00:04:44,974
- Hey, Joey. We're ready.
- Yeah, me too.

64
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,228
Richard, we're ready for you.

65
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:51,517
Joey Tribbiani, this is Richard Crosby.
He's playing Vincent.

66
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:55,164
- I'm acting with you?
- Nice to meet you.

67
00:04:55,381 --> 00:04:59,545
I can't believe this. This is incredible.
You just won an Oscar.

68
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,877
No, I didn't.

69
00:05:02,618 --> 00:05:04,242
I think you did.

70
00:05:05,436 --> 00:05:08,390
I think I lost, three times.

71
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:12,841
- Cookie? Would you...?
- No.

72
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:17,088
We're about an hour away
from getting the scene lit.

73
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,571
- Can you guys run it a couple times?
- Yeah, sure.

74
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,555
All right. Let's do it.

75
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,351
And... Action!

76
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:31,630
- We have to find the platoon!
- Forget it, the platoon is gone!

77
00:05:35,114 --> 00:05:38,969
- What?
- The platoon's dead! Face facts, Tony!

78
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:43,880
What'll we do?
We have no reinforcements or food.

79
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:47,838
There's food in the basement.
Potatoes and some pasta.

80
00:05:49,274 --> 00:05:52,500
Hang on.
Joey, you keep touching your face.

81
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:53,749
Something wrong?

82
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,534
No. No.

83
00:05:58,285 --> 00:06:01,202
I thought it might be
a cool character thing.

84
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,262
He's a face toucher.

85
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:09,415
I don't think so.

86
00:06:10,914 --> 00:06:14,841
Let's take it back
to Richard's last lines. Action!

87
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,562
We may not have weapons,
but we still have food.

88
00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:20,200
Potatoes, pasta...

89
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:22,393
...and a few tins of tuna!

90
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:27,220
Honey, we gotta go!

91
00:06:27,544 --> 00:06:30,214
Here's a question
you never want to ask:

92
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:34,395
Can my dad borrow one of your
pearl necklaces?

93
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,805
Did he say what kind of neckline
he's wearing?

94
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:40,034
No.

95
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:43,093
I just met him once,
but I'm guessing...

96
00:06:43,305 --> 00:06:44,277
...plunging?

97
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:49,115
He is more of a if-you've-got-it-
flaunt-it kind of father.

98
00:06:50,264 --> 00:06:52,660
Let me see if Rachel has anything.

99
00:06:52,873 --> 00:06:54,782
Yes, include more people in this.

100
00:06:56,874 --> 00:07:00,871
Do you realize that at this time tomorrow
we're gonna be getting married?

101
00:07:01,118 --> 00:07:03,063
I have a date tomorrow night.

102
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:08,765
- I can't believe we made it.
- Don't sound so surprised.

103
00:07:08,981 --> 00:07:10,405
I'm sorry, but...

104
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:13,953
- Nothing.
- What?

105
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,270
Well, honestly?
Ever since we got engaged...

106
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,433
...I've been waiting for something
to flip you out.

107
00:07:21,611 --> 00:07:23,307
Honestly? Me too.

108
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:26,409
- Really?
- Yeah.

109
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:30,476
I think that something
will come up and I'll go all...

110
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:32,221
Well, Chandler.

111
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,551
- But nothing has.
- I'm so glad.

112
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:38,475
Thank you for staying
so calm during this.

113
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:40,875
It's made me stay calm.

114
00:07:42,277 --> 00:07:44,222
I could've been worse.

115
00:07:44,956 --> 00:07:46,415
I'll be right there.

116
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,747
If you're calling before Saturday,
you've reached Monica and Chandler.

117
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,107
But if you're calling after Saturday,
you've reached Mr. And Mrs. Bing.

118
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:05,235
Please leave a message
for... the Bings!

119
00:08:22,322 --> 00:08:24,304
Hey, Maureen! Hi!

120
00:08:24,514 --> 00:08:28,583
- This is my cousin, Maureen.
- We're the Bings.

121
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,525
Hi! You guys look so beautiful.

122
00:08:34,743 --> 00:08:36,403
Mr. And Mrs. Bing!

123
00:08:39,718 --> 00:08:41,556
Monica.

124
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:45,661
So you know, I had my
"older brother" talk with Chandler.

125
00:08:45,876 --> 00:08:47,192
What is that?

126
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:50,598
I told him that if he ever hurt you...

127
00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:54,600
...I would hunt him down
and kick his ass.

128
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,825
What is the matter with everybody?
I'm serious.

129
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:02,504
I would kick his ass!

130
00:09:05,186 --> 00:09:07,298
Ross, please, my makeup!

131
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:12,724
- Chandler.
- Mom.

132
00:09:12,944 --> 00:09:15,684
Thanks for wearing... something.

133
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,855
This is so exciting! I thought we
screwed you up too much for this.

134
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:29,042
Just think, soon there will be
lots of little Bings.

135
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:37,259
I can't believe I'm going back to work
to get spit on again.

136
00:09:37,507 --> 00:09:41,362
You're lucky. At least the people
that spit on you are famous.

137
00:09:42,483 --> 00:09:46,029
- Who spits on you?
- I don't want to talk about work.

138
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:51,595
Mrs. Bing? These are my parents,
Judy and Jack Geller.

139
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,731
- It's lovely to meet you.
- Are you his mother or father?

140
00:09:55,982 --> 00:09:57,535
Jack!

141
00:09:58,696 --> 00:10:01,127
What? I've never seen one before.

142
00:10:01,374 --> 00:10:03,700
Dad, there's Ross.
Go talk to him.

143
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:07,177
I wasn't even able to act
like I'm okay with it.

144
00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:12,367
Hello, all.

145
00:10:13,273 --> 00:10:15,562
Hi... Dad.

146
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:19,251
Hi, Mr. Bing.

147
00:10:20,823 --> 00:10:23,848
- Nora.
- Charles.

148
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:28,779
- It's so great to see you both here.
- Yes.

149
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:32,580
Although we may be seeing
too much of some people.

150
00:10:35,331 --> 00:10:38,593
Aren't you a little old
to wear a dress like that?

151
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:42,903
Don't you have a little too much penis
to wear a dress like that?

152
00:10:44,585 --> 00:10:46,353
Oh, my God.

153
00:10:49,004 --> 00:10:51,709
Of course you can kick his ass, son.

154
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:55,332
You could kick anyone's ass
you want to.

155
00:10:56,554 --> 00:10:58,879
Thanks, you guys.

156
00:11:02,573 --> 00:11:03,854
- Rach, Rach?
- Yeah?

157
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:07,924
Talk to Chandler's dad and
keep him away from Chandler's mom.

158
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:12,516
- But I don't know what he looks like.
- He's the man in the black dress.

159
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:23,617
Hi! I'm Rachel,
a friend of Monica and Chandler's.

160
00:11:23,831 --> 00:11:26,951
- I'm Amanda.
- Oh, I get it.

161
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:30,397
"A man, duh!"

162
00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:37,220
Could I have your attention?

163
00:11:38,304 --> 00:11:42,575
- I'm Ross Geller.
- Dr. Ross Geller.

164
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:47,556
Dad, please. As I was saying...

165
00:11:47,802 --> 00:11:50,434
...I'm Dr. Ross Geller.

166
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:53,814
And I'm the best man.

167
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:58,787
And I have to say, I'm a little
surprised we're all here today.

168
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:02,409
For those of you
who don't know Chandler...

169
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,649
...he's not the biggest fan
of relationships.

170
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,712
In fact, I think
before he met Monica...

171
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:14,342
...the only real relationship he
had was with a girl named Molly.

172
00:12:14,556 --> 00:12:18,934
And he would've married her,
only she couldn't control her bladder.

173
00:12:23,463 --> 00:12:26,689
It was his dog.
Did I say it was his dog?

174
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:29,342
Any... Anyway...

175
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:35,322
This marriage is
doubly special for me...

176
00:12:35,536 --> 00:12:39,604
...because not only is the groom
my best friend...

177
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:44,442
...but the bride is my little sister.

178
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,441
She's the greatest sister
a guy could ask for.

179
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:53,165
Please join me in raising a glass...

180
00:12:53,385 --> 00:12:57,347
...to the couple we're
here to celebrate.

181
00:12:57,768 --> 00:13:00,401
- To the Bings.
- To the Bings!

182
00:13:10,293 --> 00:13:15,608
How cool is it that the next time you see
Chandler you'll be walking down the aisle?

183
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:19,574
I can't believe that after tomorrow
it's all gonna be over.

184
00:13:19,826 --> 00:13:24,618
Honey, it's not gonna be over.
You're gonna be married to Chandler.

185
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,451
Maybe I can wear the
dress for Halloween!

186
00:13:30,263 --> 00:13:32,245
I'm gonna steam my dress.

187
00:13:32,455 --> 00:13:35,088
Who will make sure nothing
happens to it?

188
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:37,941
- I'll do it.
- Who wants it? Anybody?

189
00:13:38,822 --> 00:13:40,696
- I said, I'll do it.
- Nobody?

190
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:45,216
- All right, I'll do it myself.
- I'm not gonna screw it up.

191
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:49,184
You're right. I'm sorry.
You were a big help tonight.

192
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:52,945
Thanks for helping my grandmother
get to the hotel safely.

193
00:13:53,191 --> 00:13:57,296
- Of course! That's what I'm here for.
- Okay. Sorry.

194
00:13:59,454 --> 00:14:00,842
What grandmother?

195
00:14:04,986 --> 00:14:08,770
- Where have you been?
- Taking my parents to the hotel.

196
00:14:08,986 --> 00:14:11,204
- Going back to work?
- Yeah.

197
00:14:11,422 --> 00:14:13,119
- Nice shades.
- Thanks.

198
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:17,440
I figure if I wear these in my scenes,
I won't get spit in my eyes.

199
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:23,450
And, if I remember correctly,
Ray-Ban was the official sponsor of WWI.

200
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,246
Great! All right!

201
00:14:27,705 --> 00:14:29,543
- I'll see you later.
- All right.

202
00:14:29,793 --> 00:14:32,888
- Where's Chandler?
- I think he's in Rachel's room.

203
00:14:34,246 --> 00:14:35,526
Chandler?

204
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,498
- Is Monica here?
- She's steaming her dress. Why?

205
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:08,058
- I think Chandler's gone.
- What?

206
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:12,162
- He left that.
- "Tell Monica I'm sorry."

207
00:15:13,142 --> 00:15:14,731
Oh, my God.

208
00:15:15,474 --> 00:15:16,897
What's up?

209
00:15:19,162 --> 00:15:21,593
"Tell Monica I'm sorry."

210
00:15:23,197 --> 00:15:25,000
Tell her yourself.

211
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,154
Oh, my God.
Chandler just left, though?

212
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,974
Maybe it's not what we think.
Maybe it's:

213
00:15:37,148 --> 00:15:41,182
"Tell Monica I'm sorry
I drank the last of the milk."

214
00:15:41,393 --> 00:15:45,771
Or "Tell Monica I'm sorry I used
her tweezers to pluck my nose hair."

215
00:15:46,926 --> 00:15:48,550
He does that. I've seen him.

216
00:15:50,161 --> 00:15:56,319
Or maybe he was writing to tell her
that he's changed his name:

217
00:15:56,528 --> 00:15:59,589
"Tell Monica I'm Sorry."

218
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:07,409
- It means he freaked out and left!
- Don't be so negative!

219
00:16:07,627 --> 00:16:12,977
Good God, isn't it possible that
"Sorry" is sitting in there right now?

220
00:16:14,132 --> 00:16:18,201
Phoebe, I think Ross is right.
What are we gonna do?

221
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:21,958
I'm gonna have to go find him
and bring him back.

222
00:16:22,204 --> 00:16:25,750
You make sure Monica
does not find out, okay?

223
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:29,186
But if you don't find him
and bring him back...

224
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:32,739
...I am gonna hunt you down
and kick your ass!

225
00:16:35,425 --> 00:16:37,228
I will find him.

226
00:16:44,575 --> 00:16:46,520
Well, the dress is done.

227
00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:49,129
What?

228
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,223
We're just so happy for you.

229
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:54,795
That's so sweet!

230
00:16:55,395 --> 00:16:59,702
Can we just take a minute and talk about
the man I'm gonna marry tomorrow.

231
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:02,136
I mean, how lucky am I?

232
00:17:02,946 --> 00:17:04,998
That's a good question.

233
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:10,519
I just hope that someday
you guys find someone like Chandler.

234
00:17:10,773 --> 00:17:14,451
I hope we find someone exactly
like Chandler and soon.

235
00:17:19,263 --> 00:17:22,774
Joey? Can you
go through these lines with me?

236
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,974
Oh, man, they just re-did my makeup.

237
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:30,595
- Just the last two pages.
- All right.

238
00:17:34,884 --> 00:17:36,616
I found the picture!

239
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:39,779
Picture? What picture?

240
00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:43,023
The picture of my wife
I found in your pack.

241
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:47,921
- Could you lower the script?
- I don't want to.

242
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:53,173
I need to see your face
so I can play off your reaction.

243
00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:55,439
Okay, look.

244
00:17:55,655 --> 00:18:00,376
I know you're great
and play all those Shakespeare guys...

245
00:18:00,595 --> 00:18:03,026
...but you're spitting
all over me, man.

246
00:18:03,657 --> 00:18:07,097
- Of course I am!
- You know you've been spitting?

247
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:09,396
That's what real actors do.

248
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:13,954
Enunciation is the mark
of a good actor.

249
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:17,189
And when you enunciate, you spit!

250
00:18:19,626 --> 00:18:22,259
Didn't know that.

251
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:24,911
Thanks. Okay, check it out.

252
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:29,328
Picture? What picture?

253
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,751
- Gunther, have you seen Chandler?
- No, I haven't seen him.

254
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:45,023
- Damn.
- He's getting married tomorrow, right?

255
00:18:45,268 --> 00:18:47,972
Yes. Don't worry.
Everything's fine.

256
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:51,903
- We'll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
- I wasn't invited.

257
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,738
Then we'll see you
the day after tomorrow.

258
00:18:59,428 --> 00:19:01,124
Mom? Dad?

259
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,454
What are you doing here?

260
00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:07,421
We thought we'd see what
the fuss is all about.

261
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:11,150
- I see why the girls like coming here.
- Why?

262
00:19:11,361 --> 00:19:13,994
The sexy blond behind the counter.

263
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:23,635
- Gunther?
- She just added him to her list.

264
00:19:24,652 --> 00:19:28,436
- What? Your list?
- Of people we're allowed to sleep...

265
00:19:28,688 --> 00:19:31,226
I know what the list is.

266
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:34,141
Come on, sit down.
Have a cup of joe.

267
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,871
Dad, I can't. I'm sorry.

268
00:19:38,116 --> 00:19:41,485
If you see Chandler,
tell him I'm looking for him.

269
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,113
And if you see Rita Moreno,
let her know I'm looking for her.

270
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:52,968
Action!

271
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:58,075
I found the picture!

272
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,794
What picture?

273
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:05,009
The picture of my wife, in your pack!

274
00:20:05,636 --> 00:20:08,448
You went through my personal property?

275
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:13,146
Why do you have a picture of Paulette
in your pack?

276
00:20:16,457 --> 00:20:19,790
Because, Vincent, we were lovers...

277
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:22,922
...for two years!

278
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:25,805
Cut! Wonderful!

279
00:20:28,703 --> 00:20:29,806
Great scene!

280
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:34,294
You were awesome. In that
last speech, you soaked me.

281
00:20:34,444 --> 00:20:37,505
- Tomorrow's call sheet.
- I'm not working tomorrow.

282
00:20:37,714 --> 00:20:41,083
- You are now.
- No, you gotta get me out of it.

283
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,314
I have plans. Important plans!

284
00:20:51,874 --> 00:20:55,515
- Ross said still no word from Chandler.
- Oh, man.

285
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:59,176
But they found the grandmother
wandering down 5th Avenue.

286
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:03,142
Okay, well, there's one down.

287
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:05,994
I'm getting married today!

288
00:21:09,897 --> 00:21:13,716
I cracked a rib, but I don't care.
Today's my wedding!

289
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:16,258
My day is finally here!

290
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:21,965
She might not even notice he's gone.

291
00:21:23,361 --> 00:21:25,508
I'm gonna start getting ready!

292
00:21:27,397 --> 00:21:31,431
We can't let her start getting ready.
This is too awful!

293
00:21:31,641 --> 00:21:35,010
But she'll be in the gown
and then he won't show up...

294
00:21:35,191 --> 00:21:37,966
...then she'll have
to take off the gown...

295
00:21:38,182 --> 00:21:40,755
Stop it. You can't do this here.

296
00:21:42,497 --> 00:21:43,920
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

297
00:21:44,097 --> 00:21:46,600
It's just so sad.

298
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,764
Pull it together.
She can't see you like this.

299
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:54,046
- She'll know something's wrong.
- I know. I know. Oh, God!

300
00:21:54,256 --> 00:21:55,881
There's no tissue.

301
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,353
Can you grab me some toilet paper?

302
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:02,603
Oh, that's gone too.
This is Monica's bathroom, right?

303
00:22:03,476 --> 00:22:05,943
- I found one.
- Okay.

304
00:22:08,555 --> 00:22:10,323
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

305
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,412
Oh, God.

306
00:22:15,236 --> 00:22:17,074
Can I have another one?

307
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:19,436
Sure.

308
00:22:22,612 --> 00:22:24,521
Do you need some floss?

309
00:22:25,952 --> 00:22:29,771
I can't imagine what will happen
if he doesn't show up.

310
00:22:29,987 --> 00:22:31,719
Here's a whole bunch.

311
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,296
She'll be at the wedding waiting...

312
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:38,021
...and people will be whispering,
"Oh, that poor girl."

313
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:41,531
Then she'll have to come back here
and live alone.

314
00:22:41,782 --> 00:22:43,691
- Oh, my God.
- What?

315
00:22:43,938 --> 00:22:49,218
There was a pregnancy test in the
garbage. And it's positive.

316
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,381
Monica's pregnant.

317
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,904
So I guess she won't be totally alone.

318
00:23:01,856 --> 00:23:02,888
Oh, my God!

319
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:06,442
I know. Monica's gonna have a baby!

320
00:23:06,658 --> 00:23:09,505
Can this count as her "something new"?

321
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,733
Oh, my God.

322
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:18,127
Do you think this is why
Chandler took off?

323
00:23:18,382 --> 00:23:22,344
She had to have just taken that test.
I took out the trash last night.

324
00:23:22,557 --> 00:23:24,989
It's turning into
the worst wedding ever.

325
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:29,756
The bride's pregnant, the groom's
missing and I'm still holding this.

326
00:23:30,734 --> 00:23:35,385
Phoebe, we cannot tell anyone
about this.

327
00:23:35,605 --> 00:23:37,858
- Right. Yeah.
- Okay?

328
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:41,479
Hey, wait. Do you know
what kind of birth control she uses?

329
00:23:41,693 --> 00:23:42,724
No. Why?

330
00:23:42,981 --> 00:23:46,800
Just for the future.
This is hardly a commercial for it.

331
00:23:52,826 --> 00:23:53,762
Anything?

332
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:57,378
No. I talked to Joey on the set.
He hasn't heard from him.

333
00:23:57,593 --> 00:24:00,025
I talked to Chandler's parents again.

334
00:24:00,202 --> 00:24:01,518
You said he was missing?

335
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:04,403
No. I made it seem
like I called to chat.

336
00:24:04,621 --> 00:24:07,955
Pretty sure they both think
I'm interested in them.

337
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:10,743
- We've got to tell her he's gone.
- No, we can't.

338
00:24:10,952 --> 00:24:13,135
She'll start getting ready soon.

339
00:24:13,354 --> 00:24:17,660
Can't you stall her? I'll go back
to the places I went last night.

340
00:24:17,876 --> 00:24:19,086
How much time?

341
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:22,149
How long before she absolutely
has to start getting ready?

342
00:24:22,365 --> 00:24:23,824
- One hour.
- Give me two.

343
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,122
Then why do you ask?

344
00:24:27,584 --> 00:24:30,122
- Wish me luck.
- I'm going with you.

345
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:31,818
Why?

346
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:36,628
You're tired. You looked all night.
And, clearly, you suck at this.

347
00:24:36,838 --> 00:24:39,993
I have documented night blindness.

348
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:42,044
No, you don't!

349
00:24:42,265 --> 00:24:44,412
Okay. But I don't suck!

350
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,872
See you later.

351
00:24:46,093 --> 00:24:48,240
Do you know how
you're gonna stall her?

352
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:50,784
Because she is insane
about her schedule today.

353
00:24:50,998 --> 00:24:54,259
- I'll figure something out.
- Okay, good luck.

354
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:00,171
I thought we'd start with my makeup
and then do my hair.

355
00:25:00,391 --> 00:25:04,282
Okay. But before you do that,
I need you to talk to me.

356
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,190
About what?

357
00:25:08,603 --> 00:25:12,280
I'm never gonna get married!

358
00:25:12,534 --> 00:25:15,559
You will. The right guy's
just around the corner.

359
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,857
Okay, are we done with that?

360
00:25:18,692 --> 00:25:20,424
No, I'm serious.

361
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:25,855
Maybe I should just forget about it.
Become a lesbian or something.

362
00:25:26,102 --> 00:25:28,285
Any woman would be lucky to have you.

363
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,577
Maybe I'd feel better
if I slept with Joey.

364
00:25:33,757 --> 00:25:35,702
Rachel? Are you okay?

365
00:25:40,402 --> 00:25:45,515
Excuse me, Aaron? I have
a little problem with the schedule.

366
00:25:45,725 --> 00:25:50,553
I wasn't supposed to work today.
I have a wedding that I have to be at.

367
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:53,510
It's my best friend's
and I'm officiating...

368
00:25:53,728 --> 00:25:55,637
...so I really can't work past 4.

369
00:25:56,441 --> 00:26:01,269
You've gotta stay until the end.
We can't stop filming just for you.

370
00:26:01,486 --> 00:26:03,739
It's not like it's your wedding.

371
00:26:03,956 --> 00:26:06,103
It is my wedding.

372
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:08,374
Did I not make that clear?

373
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:10,903
You said your best friend
is getting married.

374
00:26:11,123 --> 00:26:12,439
Yeah, to me.

375
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:16,403
Yeah, I'm marrying my best friend.
Isn't that beautiful?

376
00:26:17,282 --> 00:26:20,022
- But you said you were officiating.
- Yeah.

377
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:23,787
- Your own wedding?
- Happens more than you think.

378
00:26:24,971 --> 00:26:27,568
I'm sorry, Joey. It's still no.

379
00:26:28,345 --> 00:26:30,290
I'm having surgery.

380
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:32,789
What?

381
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:37,455
I made up the stuff about the wedding
because I didn't want you to worry.

382
00:26:37,704 --> 00:26:39,507
But I'm having surgery today.

383
00:26:39,862 --> 00:26:41,320
What kind of surgery?

384
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:44,347
Transplant.

385
00:26:46,124 --> 00:26:48,697
But you're supposed to work on Monday.

386
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,411
Hair transplant.

387
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,148
But you're not bald.

388
00:26:54,056 --> 00:26:56,238
It's not on my head.

389
00:26:59,832 --> 00:27:04,588
There's nothing I can do.
You'll probably be out by 4 anyway.

390
00:27:04,842 --> 00:27:09,325
We've just got one short scene, it's
just you and Richard and he's a pro.

391
00:27:09,574 --> 00:27:11,483
You'll be fine.

392
00:27:12,148 --> 00:27:13,571
Morning, Richard.

393
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:16,809
Hey, you're here! Great!
Let's go, buddy!

394
00:27:17,018 --> 00:27:19,236
We got a scene to shoot!

395
00:27:20,254 --> 00:27:22,827
I'm wearing two belts.

396
00:27:26,204 --> 00:27:28,386
- Are you drunk?
- No.

397
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:29,576
Yes, you are!

398
00:27:30,623 --> 00:27:32,081
All right.

399
00:27:36,467 --> 00:27:40,666
We are never gonna find him.
He's one guy in a huge city.

400
00:27:41,234 --> 00:27:43,381
Oh, my God. Is that him?

401
00:27:44,887 --> 00:27:48,220
That is an old Chinese woman.

402
00:27:49,932 --> 00:27:52,149
He could be in disguise, you know.

403
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,704
You know what? You're right.
You're absolutely right.

404
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:57,754
Wait a minute.

405
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,980
Chandler!

406
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,881
Now you're thinking.

407
00:28:04,092 --> 00:28:06,594
Maybe we're just approaching
this all wrong.

408
00:28:06,806 --> 00:28:09,094
If you're Chandler
and you want to hide...

409
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:13,545
...where is the last place on Earth
people would think you'd go?

410
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,329
So this is your office.

411
00:28:16,965 --> 00:28:20,440
How'd you guys find me?
I knew I should've hid at the gym.

412
00:28:22,358 --> 00:28:24,789
- What the hell are you doing?
- Panicking.

413
00:28:25,523 --> 00:28:29,165
And using the Internet to try to prove
that I'm related to Monica.

414
00:28:32,064 --> 00:28:34,496
- How is she?
- She doesn't know you're gone.

415
00:28:34,709 --> 00:28:38,386
And she doesn't have to know.
Come on, we're going home.

416
00:28:38,605 --> 00:28:40,966
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

417
00:28:41,145 --> 00:28:44,265
Because if I go home,
we're gonna become the Bings.

418
00:28:44,694 --> 00:28:46,283
I can't be the Bings.

419
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:47,961
What's wrong with it?

420
00:28:48,207 --> 00:28:50,117
The Bings have horrible marriages.

421
00:28:50,365 --> 00:28:51,610
They yell, they fight...

422
00:28:51,827 --> 00:28:55,717
...and they use the pool boy
as a pawn in their sexual games.

423
00:28:56,732 --> 00:29:01,524
Have you ever put on a black dress
and asked me up to your hotel room?

424
00:29:01,846 --> 00:29:05,144
- No.
- Then you are neither of your parents.

425
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,138
It's not just their marriage.
Look at yours. Look at everybody's.

426
00:29:12,353 --> 00:29:15,307
Only Paul Newman
can make marriage work.

427
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:17,500
And I've met me.
I am no Paul Newman.

428
00:29:17,746 --> 00:29:22,646
I don't race cars or make popcorn.
None of my proceeds go to charity.

429
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:24,701
But look, Chandler...

430
00:29:25,574 --> 00:29:29,808
...right now no one has
a lower opinion of you than I do.

431
00:29:31,662 --> 00:29:34,260
But I totally believe you can do this.

432
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:38,753
I want to. I love her so much,
but I'm afraid...

433
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,804
This is too huge.

434
00:29:41,022 --> 00:29:43,003
You're right. It is huge.

435
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:46,891
So why don't we take it
just a little bit at a time.

436
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:50,135
Forget getting married for a sec.
Just forget about it.

437
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:54,059
Can you just come home
and take a shower?

438
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,323
Well, yeah. But then...

439
00:29:59,913 --> 00:30:02,796
We're just gonna go home
and take a shower.

440
00:30:02,975 --> 00:30:05,027
That's not scary, right?

441
00:30:05,445 --> 00:30:07,983
Depends on what you mean by "we."

442
00:30:08,994 --> 00:30:11,106
- All right!
- There he is!

443
00:30:11,325 --> 00:30:14,658
Good old Chandler
with the homophobic jokes.

444
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:16,227
So, what do you say?

445
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,969
I'll shower,
but I won't promise anything.

446
00:30:19,188 --> 00:30:23,838
Okay, that's all we're talking about.
Okay? Come on, let's go home.

447
00:30:27,573 --> 00:30:29,127
Who's Mike Smith?

448
00:30:30,148 --> 00:30:32,650
I was sure this was my office.

449
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,133
The nights are the hardest.

450
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:41,653
But then the day comes...

451
00:30:41,908 --> 00:30:44,304
...and that's every bit as hard
as the night.

452
00:30:46,187 --> 00:30:49,900
- Then the night comes again...
- The days and nights are hard, I get it!

453
00:30:50,118 --> 00:30:53,831
I have to start getting ready.
I'm getting married today.

454
00:30:54,745 --> 00:30:57,521
I know. At dusk.

455
00:30:57,737 --> 00:31:00,168
That's such a hard time for me.

456
00:31:00,868 --> 00:31:04,451
I'm gonna put my makeup on.
We have to be at the hotel in an hour.

457
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,119
- Wait!
- What?

458
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,513
Let's go to lunch!

459
00:31:08,871 --> 00:31:10,495
I can't go to lunch!

460
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:12,198
Right.

461
00:31:14,855 --> 00:31:17,358
Oh, good God, I've fallen down.

462
00:31:19,934 --> 00:31:21,631
What's going on?

463
00:31:24,423 --> 00:31:26,083
All right, honey, listen.

464
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:32,038
When I tell you what I'm about to
tell you, I need you to remember...

465
00:31:32,286 --> 00:31:35,655
...that we are all here for you
and that we love you.

466
00:31:35,904 --> 00:31:38,157
Okay, you're really freaking me out.

467
00:31:40,183 --> 00:31:42,437
We can't find Chandler...

468
00:31:43,732 --> 00:31:45,261
...'s vest.

469
00:31:46,133 --> 00:31:48,185
We can't find Chandler's vest.

470
00:31:48,429 --> 00:31:51,062
How can that be?
Wait, are you serious?

471
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:53,985
Found the vest.

472
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:58,368
We'll have to keep an eye on it,
make sure we don't lose it again.

473
00:31:59,424 --> 00:32:02,128
Okay, don't scare me like that, okay?

474
00:32:03,216 --> 00:32:07,771
For a minute, I was like,
"Oh, my God! The worst has happened!"

475
00:32:12,261 --> 00:32:15,630
I would sooner die in this hellhole
than see her back with you!

476
00:32:15,845 --> 00:32:17,897
That can be arranged.

477
00:32:21,585 --> 00:32:24,183
- Let's reset.
- What?! He got me!

478
00:32:26,387 --> 00:32:28,439
Let's take it from there.

479
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:33,061
Are you a little off today?
It's going terribly slowly.

480
00:32:34,423 --> 00:32:38,278
Look, my best friends are getting
married in, like, an hour, okay?

481
00:32:38,494 --> 00:32:41,720
And I'm the minister.
Please, can you pull it together?

482
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:47,121
Of course. I'm sorry. I'd hate you to miss
anything like that on account of me.

483
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:49,940
- I can do this.
- Thank you. Thank you.

484
00:32:50,115 --> 00:32:52,297
Still rolling. And, action.

485
00:32:52,585 --> 00:32:55,610
I would sooner die in this hellhole
than see her back with you!

486
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,181
That can be arranged!

487
00:33:01,387 --> 00:33:02,941
Slippery little bugger!

488
00:33:15,826 --> 00:33:17,735
So you two were married, huh?

489
00:33:20,071 --> 00:33:22,668
What happened, you just drift apart?

490
00:33:25,428 --> 00:33:27,540
Do you remember our wedding day?

491
00:33:27,794 --> 00:33:30,676
Did you know I slept with the best man?

492
00:33:30,891 --> 00:33:32,279
Yes, he told me.

493
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:35,063
At least I think that was what he said.

494
00:33:35,274 --> 00:33:39,866
It was difficult to understand
with his legs wrapped around my head.

495
00:33:44,668 --> 00:33:47,266
Here comes the bride.

496
00:33:49,817 --> 00:33:53,222
Oh, my God, Monica!

497
00:33:53,714 --> 00:33:56,145
I want to wear this every day.

498
00:33:56,428 --> 00:33:58,409
You look so beautiful.

499
00:33:59,802 --> 00:34:01,499
I'm so happy for me.

500
00:34:05,648 --> 00:34:08,565
- Hello?
- Did Chandler show up yet?

501
00:34:08,779 --> 00:34:12,325
- We got him back. Everything's fine.
- Damn it!

502
00:34:12,536 --> 00:34:15,240
- Where are you?
- I'm still on the set.

503
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:18,376
The wedding is in less than an hour.

504
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:23,417
I know. I'm sorry. The guy's drunk.
They won't let me go until we get this.

505
00:34:23,634 --> 00:34:27,145
Oh, my God. I'm gonna
have to find another minister.

506
00:34:27,427 --> 00:34:29,965
No, I'm the minister!

507
00:34:30,245 --> 00:34:33,649
Look, put them both on the phone,
I'll marry them right now.

508
00:34:34,454 --> 00:34:35,949
Joey, I have to go.

509
00:34:36,195 --> 00:34:39,836
Don't hang up on me! I'll marry you
and me right now! I have the power!

510
00:34:44,092 --> 00:34:47,247
There you go! You put on a tuxedo!

511
00:34:47,954 --> 00:34:49,864
That wasn't scary, was it?

512
00:34:50,737 --> 00:34:51,841
No.

513
00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:55,677
I'm telling you,
just a little bit at a time.

514
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:58,072
What's the next little bit?

515
00:34:59,296 --> 00:35:01,205
Getting married.

516
00:35:01,419 --> 00:35:06,282
You can do that too.
Just like you've done everything else.

517
00:35:08,203 --> 00:35:11,536
Yeah, you're right. I can do that.

518
00:35:12,065 --> 00:35:15,992
- Excuse me for a minute.
- Where you going?

519
00:35:16,204 --> 00:35:19,810
I'm not gonna run away again.
I just want some fresh air.

520
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:21,700
- Okay.
- Okay.

521
00:35:30,991 --> 00:35:33,458
Oh, fresh air!

522
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:39,195
- Cover for me.
- Maybe you're overreacting. You do that.

523
00:35:39,411 --> 00:35:41,487
We gotta do something.

524
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:46,428
Joey won't make it, so I'll look around
the hotel for other weddings.

525
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:50,360
Don't tell them Monica's pregnant,
because they frown on that.

526
00:35:50,822 --> 00:35:51,759
Okay.

527
00:36:02,548 --> 00:36:06,925
Anastassakis Papasifakis wedding.
Excellent.

528
00:36:09,123 --> 00:36:10,855
Congratulations.

529
00:36:11,072 --> 00:36:12,696
Mazel tov.

530
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:15,276
Hi! Oh, great hat.

531
00:36:16,882 --> 00:36:20,357
I need you to perform another wedding.
Can you do that?

532
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,524
I don't know.
Are they Greek Orthodox?

533
00:36:23,735 --> 00:36:25,360
Yeah. Yeah.

534
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:30,028
They're my friends,
Monica Stephanopolis.

535
00:36:30,451 --> 00:36:34,579
And Chandler Acidophilus.

536
00:36:38,835 --> 00:36:41,717
Hi. Hi.

537
00:36:43,114 --> 00:36:44,953
Hi.

538
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:49,510
Has anyone seen Chandler?

539
00:36:49,725 --> 00:36:52,785
- I thought he was with you.
- He was with me.

540
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:55,663
We're playing a little game.
Hide-and-seek.

541
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:58,730
You can't ask us, son.
That's cheating.

542
00:37:03,642 --> 00:37:07,320
You're right.
Thanks for keeping me honest, Dad.

543
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:11,357
He better not come here. He can't see
the bride in her wedding dress.

544
00:37:11,574 --> 00:37:15,808
As I recall, when we got married,
I saw the groom in the wedding dress.

545
00:37:16,828 --> 00:37:20,162
That was after the wedding.
It's not bad luck then.

546
00:37:20,376 --> 00:37:22,523
Honey, it isn't good luck.

547
00:37:26,847 --> 00:37:29,943
Oh, my God! Monica.

548
00:37:30,153 --> 00:37:31,885
I know!

549
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:36,339
- How's Chandler doing?
- Great.

550
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,923
He's doing great.
Don't you worry about Chandler.

551
00:37:41,043 --> 00:37:42,074
Are you okay?

552
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:45,528
Well, you're sweating.

553
00:37:46,157 --> 00:37:49,182
Out of happiness for you and Chandler.

554
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:52,513
These are beads of joy.

555
00:37:53,185 --> 00:37:54,466
That's sweet.

556
00:37:54,682 --> 00:37:56,378
Don't touch me.

557
00:37:57,465 --> 00:38:00,904
- Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
- Yeah.

558
00:38:06,476 --> 00:38:09,108
- What's going on?
- Chandler's gone again.

559
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:14,928
Why would you play hide-and-seek
with someone you know is a flight risk?

560
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:22,335
Aaron, you gotta let me go.
The guy's hammered.

561
00:38:22,515 --> 00:38:27,414
I'm sorry. As long as he's here
and conscious, we're still shooting.

562
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:40,459
You wouldn't happen to have
a very big fork?

563
00:38:42,206 --> 00:38:44,875
So I just talked to the director.

564
00:38:45,094 --> 00:38:47,941
That's it. We're done for the day.

565
00:38:49,025 --> 00:38:50,520
We finished the scene?

566
00:38:50,766 --> 00:38:55,416
- You were wonderful.
- As were you.

567
00:38:56,402 --> 00:38:58,904
So I got your car. It's right outside.

568
00:38:59,116 --> 00:39:00,705
Why? Are we done for the day?

569
00:39:02,281 --> 00:39:04,678
That's what you told me.

570
00:39:05,865 --> 00:39:08,048
Thank you. You're welcome.

571
00:39:09,135 --> 00:39:12,884
No, we gotta go. Come on.
Here we go.

572
00:39:14,528 --> 00:39:16,853
Is that my ass?

573
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,900
- There he is!
- What?

574
00:39:28,688 --> 00:39:30,705
You're not getting
away this time, mister!

575
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:34,070
Unless you want
that ass-kicking we talked about!

576
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:36,958
Ross!

577
00:39:39,822 --> 00:39:43,297
I'm serious! You're not
walking out on my sister!

578
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,348
That's right. I'm not.

579
00:39:45,562 --> 00:39:49,073
- Then where have you been?
- I know about Monica.

580
00:39:50,294 --> 00:39:52,239
- You know?
- What?

581
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:54,111
I heard you and Rachel talking.

582
00:39:54,365 --> 00:39:57,069
- What? Talking about what?
- You don't know?

583
00:39:57,322 --> 00:40:00,762
If somebody doesn't tell me
what's going on right now...

584
00:40:00,975 --> 00:40:02,707
What, you'll "hi-yah"?

585
00:40:04,872 --> 00:40:06,569
Monica's pregnant.

586
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,220
Oh, my God.

587
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:14,125
Oh, my God.
And you're not freaking out?

588
00:40:14,335 --> 00:40:18,297
I was. Then I went to the gift shop
because I was out of cigarettes.

589
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,771
- Cigarettes?
- Big picture, please!

590
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:27,684
So when I was in the gift shop,
that's when I saw this.

591
00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:33,810
And I thought, "Anything
that can fit into this can't be scary."

592
00:40:34,514 --> 00:40:37,219
You obviously didn't see Chucky III.

593
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:42,059
But come on, look at how cute
and small this is.

594
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:46,959
So I got it to give Monica
so she'd know I was okay.

595
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:48,567
Dude.

596
00:40:49,301 --> 00:40:52,076
Way to go, son.
I knew you'd find him.

597
00:41:01,513 --> 00:41:03,766
Our little boy is getting married.

598
00:41:03,983 --> 00:41:06,973
Look at you, so handsome.

599
00:41:07,219 --> 00:41:09,437
You look beautiful, Mom.

600
00:41:12,576 --> 00:41:14,865
You look beautiful too, Dad.

601
00:41:18,456 --> 00:41:20,259
I love you both.

602
00:41:20,613 --> 00:41:22,558
I'm so glad you're here.

603
00:41:28,615 --> 00:41:29,931
Are you Chandler?

604
00:41:30,772 --> 00:41:32,754
Are you Joey?

605
00:41:38,323 --> 00:41:40,825
- This is nice.
- What?

606
00:41:41,071 --> 00:41:45,555
I've never walked down the aisle
knowing it can't end in divorce.

607
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:04,891
I wish your grandmother
had lived to see this.

608
00:42:05,112 --> 00:42:09,240
- She's right there.
- Not that old crone. My mother.

609
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,122
Congratulations, darling.

610
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,426
We love you, sweetheart.

611
00:42:21,429 --> 00:42:23,481
You look beautiful.

612
00:42:24,386 --> 00:42:26,818
- Is this new?
- Not now.

613
00:42:31,276 --> 00:42:33,672
- Who's this?
- I'm Father Karabasos.

614
00:42:34,267 --> 00:42:35,690
He's Greek Orthodox.

615
00:42:36,076 --> 00:42:38,223
As are you.

616
00:42:40,495 --> 00:42:42,049
Let us begin.

617
00:42:43,278 --> 00:42:44,417
Dearly beloved...

618
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,915
That's my line!

619
00:42:51,524 --> 00:42:53,991
I can take it from here. Thanks.

620
00:42:56,082 --> 00:42:59,972
Dearly beloved,
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

621
00:43:02,553 --> 00:43:05,542
You may be confused by this now...

622
00:43:05,754 --> 00:43:09,538
...but you won't be
Memorial Day weekend, 2002.

623
00:43:12,365 --> 00:43:16,006
Let's get started before
the groom takes off again.

624
00:43:22,488 --> 00:43:24,741
We are gathered here today...

625
00:43:25,237 --> 00:43:27,348
...to join this man...

626
00:43:27,847 --> 00:43:32,259
...and this woman
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

627
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:38,590
I've known Monica and Chandler
for a long time, and I cannot imagine...

628
00:43:38,771 --> 00:43:42,282
...two people more perfect
for each other.

629
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:49,347
And now, as I've left my notes
in my dressing room...

630
00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:53,206
...we shall proceed to the vows.
Monica?

631
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:57,999
- He took off?
- Go on. Go on.

632
00:44:04,065 --> 00:44:07,955
Chandler, for so long...

633
00:44:08,518 --> 00:44:12,100
...I wondered if I would ever
find my prince.

634
00:44:12,554 --> 00:44:14,321
My soul mate.

635
00:44:14,537 --> 00:44:17,455
Then three years ago,
at another wedding...

636
00:44:17,668 --> 00:44:20,338
...I turned to a friend for comfort.

637
00:44:20,556 --> 00:44:25,597
And instead I found everything that
I'd ever been looking for my whole life.

638
00:44:28,558 --> 00:44:30,255
And now...

639
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,139
...here we are...

640
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,452
...with our future before us.

641
00:44:37,917 --> 00:44:40,455
And I only want to spend it with you.

642
00:44:41,987 --> 00:44:43,684
My prince.

643
00:44:43,901 --> 00:44:45,810
My soul mate.

644
00:44:46,302 --> 00:44:48,070
My friend.

645
00:44:51,068 --> 00:44:52,657
Unless you don't want to.

646
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:57,328
You go.

647
00:44:58,827 --> 00:44:59,799
Chandler?

648
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:02,299
No, that's okay.

649
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:12,043
I thought this would be the most
difficult thing I ever had to do.

650
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:17,992
But when I saw you walking down
that aisle, I realized it's simple.

651
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:21,992
I love you.

652
00:45:23,842 --> 00:45:29,049
Any surprises that come our way,
it's okay, because I will always love you.

653
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:35,103
You are the person I was meant
to spend the rest of my life with.

654
00:45:35,706 --> 00:45:37,994
You want to know if I'm sure?

655
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:44,433
You may now kiss the bride.

656
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:51,953
I guess by the powers vested in me
by the state of New York...

657
00:45:52,163 --> 00:45:54,630
...and the Internet guys...

658
00:45:57,137 --> 00:46:01,100
...I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

659
00:46:01,348 --> 00:46:04,302
Oh, wait. Do you take each other?

660
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:06,701
- I do.
- I do.

661
00:46:06,949 --> 00:46:08,479
Yeah, you do!

662
00:46:10,045 --> 00:46:11,076
Rings.

663
00:46:11,297 --> 00:46:13,065
Oh, crap. Okay.

664
00:46:14,881 --> 00:46:16,541
Let's do the rings.

665
00:46:27,997 --> 00:46:30,394
We good? Yeah? Good?

666
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:33,344
Once again...

667
00:46:33,669 --> 00:46:37,038
...I pronounce you husband and wife.

668
00:46:37,287 --> 00:46:38,710
Now kiss her again.

669
00:46:54,752 --> 00:46:56,591
I love you.

670
00:46:56,805 --> 00:46:58,822
And I know about the baby.

671
00:46:59,832 --> 00:47:01,742
- What baby?
- Our baby.

672
00:47:01,954 --> 00:47:03,757
We have a baby?

673
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,691
Phoebe found your pregnancy test.

674
00:47:08,008 --> 00:47:10,120
I didn't take a pregnancy test.

675
00:47:10,374 --> 00:47:12,177
Then who did?

676
00:47:13,123 --> 00:47:14,890
Look at them.

677
00:47:15,837 --> 00:47:18,304
And they're gonna have a baby.
