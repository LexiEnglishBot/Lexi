1
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,459
Monica?

2
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:25,997
What time is it?

3
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:27,698
Nine.

4
00:00:30,142 --> 00:00:31,439
But it's dark out.

5
00:00:32,177 --> 00:00:35,840
That's because you always
sleep till noon, silly.

6
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:38,479
This is what nine looks like.

7
00:00:39,818 --> 00:00:42,048
l guess l'll get washed up then.

8
00:00:42,621 --> 00:00:44,179
Watch that sunrise.

9
00:00:47,392 --> 00:00:50,190
l'm getting tired of always
sneaking around.

10
00:00:50,395 --> 00:00:54,695
Me too. What if we went away
for the weekend? No interruptions.

11
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,891
We could be naked
the entire time.

12
00:00:57,536 --> 00:01:00,471
All weekend?
That's a whole lot of naked.

13
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:05,041
l'll say l have a conference
and you can have a chef thing.

14
00:01:05,243 --> 00:01:08,235
l wanted to go to this
culinary fair in Jersey!

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,573
Okay.
You know you're not, though.

16
00:01:11,883 --> 00:01:13,544
-Let's go.
-Okay. Wait.

17
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:15,184
What about Joey?

18
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:27,560
The One with the Kips

19
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:15,245
l'm going to a culinary fair
in Jersey this weekend.

20
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,143
How weird! Chandler just said
he's got a conference there.

21
00:02:20,986 --> 00:02:24,820
That's funny. Seems like
Chandler's conference could've been...

22
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:26,752
...in Connecticut or Vermont.

23
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:32,326
l'm not in charge of where
the conference is held.

24
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:36,690
Do you want people to think it's fake?
lt's a real conference.

25
00:02:38,904 --> 00:02:41,702
-ls Rachel here?
-No, she's out shopping.

26
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,231
-Damn!
-What's going on?

27
00:02:45,444 --> 00:02:46,934
l told Emily to come.

28
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:51,377
And l just need to, you know,
talk to Rachel about it.

29
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:54,241
Wait a minute.

30
00:02:54,453 --> 00:02:57,684
When Emily comes,
you won't see Rachel anymore?

31
00:02:57,823 --> 00:03:00,986
l'm focusing on the
''l get to see my wife'' part...

32
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:04,094
...and not on the part
that makes me do this.

33
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:09,725
So you'll never be
in a room together?

34
00:03:09,935 --> 00:03:11,630
How will that even work?

35
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,701
l have no idea.
l mean....

36
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:16,999
But l assure you,
l will figure it out.

37
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:21,607
lt doesn't seem like it'll work.

38
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:24,976
Hi, guys.

39
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:27,609
What's going on?

40
00:03:28,787 --> 00:03:31,119
We're flipping Monica's mattress.

41
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:37,786
So l'm thinking, basically,
we pick it up and then we flip it.

42
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:41,392
That's better than my way.

43
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:45,693
Hey guys, would you flip mine too?

44
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:47,528
Oh, man.

45
00:03:50,842 --> 00:03:53,367
Oh, look! A letter from my mom.

46
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:57,044
So, Rach?

47
00:03:57,983 --> 00:04:00,178
You know how Emily's coming?

48
00:04:00,385 --> 00:04:02,012
Oh, yeah. l know.

49
00:04:02,354 --> 00:04:03,878
Can you hear anything?

50
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:07,081
Yeah, somebody just said,
''Can you hear anything?''

51
00:04:12,097 --> 00:04:14,224
Hey, Joey's ass.

52
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:17,690
What are you doing?

53
00:04:17,936 --> 00:04:20,336
Remember when they fought
and broke up...

54
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:23,599
...and we were stuck here
all night with no food?

55
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:28,108
When Ross said ''Rachel'' at the wedding,
l figured it'd happen again.

56
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:30,376
So l hid this in here.

57
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:33,179
Candy bars, crossword puzzles....

58
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:35,250
<i>Mad Libs</i>! Mine!

59
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:39,618
-Okay, ''Name of someone in room.''
-Chandler.

60
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:42,519
Come on, seriously.

61
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:47,655
What do you got in here?
Magazines, Doritos--

62
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,699
Condoms?

63
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:54,302
You don't know how long
we'll be in here.

64
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,698
We may have to
repopulate the Earth.

65
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:01,842
And condoms are the way to do that?

66
00:05:03,915 --> 00:05:07,407
Anyway, it all boils down to this.

67
00:05:07,752 --> 00:05:12,280
-The last time l talked to Emily--
-Oh, my God! Our dog died!

68
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:17,125
-What?
-Oh, my God! LaPooh, our dog!

69
00:05:19,898 --> 00:05:22,628
LaPooh's still alive?

70
00:05:24,536 --> 00:05:26,504
Sorry.

71
00:05:26,638 --> 00:05:31,371
lt says he was hit by
an ice cream truck and dragged for...

72
00:05:31,643 --> 00:05:33,770
...nineteen blocks!

73
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:38,882
-Oh, my God.
-Sweetie, we heard you crying.

74
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,948
-Please don't cry.
-lt's LaPooh!

75
00:05:42,254 --> 00:05:45,553
l know, it's LaPooh right now
but it'll get better.

76
00:05:52,397 --> 00:05:54,558
l can't believe it! We're here!

77
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:58,629
Chocolates on the pillows!
l love that!

78
00:05:58,837 --> 00:06:01,738
You should live with Joey.
Rolos everywhere.

79
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:05,469
This is so great.
No one's gonna bother us.

80
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,373
And we're gonna do it.

81
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:10,106
l'm gonna do it with Monica!

82
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:15,248
Chandler, stop yelling
that you and l are gonna do it!

83
00:06:16,354 --> 00:06:18,015
-l'll be right back.
-Okay.

84
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:24,893
Oh, yes!

85
00:06:25,764 --> 00:06:28,699
Get in here.
There's a high-speed car chase on!

86
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,727
We're switching rooms.

87
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:33,663
Oh, dear God!
They gave us glasses!

88
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,673
The glasses have lipstick on them.

89
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:39,399
Who knows what else
they didn't change?

90
00:06:39,544 --> 00:06:42,377
You wanna switch rooms
because they didn't switch the glasses?

91
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:46,245
l didn't wanna say anything,
but the carpet smells too.

92
00:06:47,218 --> 00:06:52,554
l want this weekend to be perfect.
We can change rooms, can't we?

93
00:06:53,191 --> 00:06:57,184
Okay, but let's do it now.
Chopper Five just lost its feed!

94
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,707
Forget it.

95
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:24,084
You know how there was something
l wanted to talk to you about?

96
00:07:24,255 --> 00:07:25,415
Oh, yeah.

97
00:07:28,226 --> 00:07:31,457
l'm trying to work
things out with Emily.

98
00:07:33,064 --> 00:07:34,395
Well, there's this...

99
00:07:34,632 --> 00:07:36,566
...one thing.

100
00:07:39,637 --> 00:07:41,195
Here goes.

101
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:45,742
l made a promise that--

102
00:07:46,644 --> 00:07:48,475
-What?
-Your nose is bleeding.

103
00:07:48,747 --> 00:07:51,238
-Oh, God!
-You're bleeding.

104
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:55,146
Oh, not again. This happened when
my grandfather died.

105
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,712
Sorry.

106
00:07:57,422 --> 00:07:58,582
Gross.

107
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:02,248
Okay. So l'm sorry.
What did you want to tell me?

108
00:08:10,402 --> 00:08:11,767
Sorry. Sorry.

109
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:18,641
l can't see you anymore.

110
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:22,777
l know, it's ridiculous.
l can't see you, either. All right.

111
00:08:22,914 --> 00:08:26,941
l'm just gonna go shove
a bunch of tissues in my nose.

112
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:30,316
Hey, do you wanna tell me while l do that?

113
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:32,116
l'm good.

114
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:38,390
-l think you'll like this room more.
-Okay, great.

115
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,396
They say he's only got
half a tank left.

116
00:08:43,535 --> 00:08:49,064
Half a tank? Still lots
of high-speed chasing to do!

117
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:52,472
-l'll bet he's heading for Canada.
-They always do.

118
00:08:52,977 --> 00:08:55,502
-We're switching rooms again.
-What? Why?

119
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,013
This has a garden view.
We paid for an ocean view.

120
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,653
Our last ocean-view room
was unacceptable to you.

121
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:06,649
-The carpet smelled.
-Like ocean?

122
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:10,050
No, like feet.

123
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:15,265
Excuse me. Can l talk to you
over here for just a second?

124
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:25,236
These clowns want to take us
for a ride. l won't let them.

125
00:09:25,477 --> 00:09:27,411
We're not a couple of suckers.

126
00:09:28,646 --> 00:09:29,806
l hear you, Mugsy.

127
00:09:31,249 --> 00:09:33,183
All these rooms are fine.

128
00:09:33,418 --> 00:09:35,978
Just pick one so l can watch the--

129
00:09:36,221 --> 00:09:39,918
Have a perfect, magical
weekend together with you?

130
00:09:43,061 --> 00:09:46,030
Oh, man, he almost hit a gas truck.

131
00:09:46,164 --> 00:09:48,758
Do you ever watch <i>Baywatch</i>?

132
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:59,908
-This one l like.
-Nothing. Nothing. lt's over. Damn it!

133
00:10:00,044 --> 00:10:03,104
This is regularly scheduled
programming!

134
00:10:03,248 --> 00:10:07,150
-l wanted to see them talk to his neighbors.
-Well, l'm standing right here...

135
00:10:07,285 --> 00:10:10,846
-...you could talk to me.
-You didn't know him.

136
00:10:11,756 --> 00:10:13,223
Can we turn the TV off?

137
00:10:13,424 --> 00:10:16,188
Do we really want to spend
the weekend like this?

138
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:19,524
Am l getting in the way
of the room-switching fun?

139
00:10:20,465 --> 00:10:22,296
Don't blame me for tonight.

140
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:25,628
Who should l blame?
The nice bellman?

141
00:10:25,904 --> 00:10:28,304
Or the idiot who thought
he could drive...

142
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,441
...from Albany to Canada
on half a tank of gas?

143
00:10:32,477 --> 00:10:34,775
Do not speak ill of the dead.

144
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:40,474
We're supposed to be spending
a romantic weekend together.

145
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:41,945
What's the matter?

146
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:44,778
l just want to watch
a little television.

147
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:46,786
Jeez, relax, Mom.

148
00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:50,954
What did you say?

149
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:54,826
l said, ''Jeez, relax, Mon.''

150
00:10:57,235 --> 00:11:02,730
You know what, Chandler?
You like fast getaways? Watch this.

151
00:11:02,874 --> 00:11:07,470
l don't like fast getaways,
l like car chases.

152
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:19,281
-Hey, what's up?
-Hey.

153
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:24,825
l've been wanting to tell you something
and l just have to get it out.

154
00:11:24,963 --> 00:11:26,521
Okay. What's up?

155
00:11:26,664 --> 00:11:29,155
Okay, before l tell you
l just have to know...

156
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,030
...is your nose okay?

157
00:11:32,203 --> 00:11:36,003
Are all the other family pets in good health?

158
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,735
Well, Davey's still pining after LaPooh...

159
00:11:39,877 --> 00:11:42,641
...but, you know, he's a tough little turtle.

160
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:49,414
You know how you said to do
whatever it takes to fix my marriage?

161
00:11:49,587 --> 00:11:52,715
Yeah, l told you to give Emily
whatever she wants.

162
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:58,852
And while that was good advice,
you should know that what she wants...

163
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:06,703
...is for me not to see you anymore.

164
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:13,808
That's crazy! You can't do that.
What are you going to tell her?

165
00:12:19,317 --> 00:12:21,148
Oh, my God!

166
00:12:22,287 --> 00:12:24,448
You've already agreed to this.

167
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,383
lt's awful, l know.

168
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:31,790
But l have to do this
if l want my marriage to work.

169
00:12:31,996 --> 00:12:36,433
And l do. l have to make
this marriage work. l have to.

170
00:12:41,072 --> 00:12:45,509
But the good thing is, we can still
see each other until she gets here.

171
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,648
Lucky me! Oh, my God!
That is good news, Ross!

172
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,183
That's the best news l've heard
since LaPooh died!

173
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:03,993
You have no idea what a nightmare
this has been. This is so hard.

174
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:06,593
Oh, yeah, really? ls it, Ross?

175
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:10,564
-Let me make this easier for you.
-What are you doing?

176
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:12,998
-Storming out.
-lt's your apartment.

177
00:13:13,204 --> 00:13:15,695
Yeah? Well, that's how mad l am!

178
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:29,882
Damn Rolos!

179
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:34,317
You're back!
How was your conference?

180
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,791
lt was terrible. l fought with
my colleagues the entire time.

181
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,793
Are you kidding with this?

182
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:43,862
So your weekend was a bust?

183
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:47,232
No, l got to see Donald Trump
waiting for an elevator.

184
00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:52,435
You know, at the Taj Mahal
he has his own private glass elevator.

185
00:13:52,577 --> 00:13:55,068
That's right. Made by Otis Elevators.

186
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:57,704
And they don't usually do glass.

187
00:13:58,316 --> 00:14:01,149
What kinds of stuff do you know?

188
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:05,088
You're back too.

189
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,688
Could l talk to you for a second?

190
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:10,951
-How was your chef thing?
-lt was awful.

191
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:13,755
Some people don't
appreciate good food.

192
00:14:14,031 --> 00:14:16,727
Maybe the food tasted good at first...

193
00:14:16,968 --> 00:14:20,028
...but then made everybody vomit
and have diarrhea.

194
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:30,577
How much was the room?
l'll pay my half.

195
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:31,806
Fine. $300.

196
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,072
$300?

197
00:14:33,284 --> 00:14:35,377
Just think of it as $25 per room.

198
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:41,654
What are you guys woofing about?

199
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,660
Chandler stole a 20 from my purse!

200
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:50,434
l was only stealing it back,
the one that she stole from me.

201
00:14:50,568 --> 00:14:53,696
Stealing and now lying.

202
00:14:54,238 --> 00:14:56,934
You know what?
Now that l think about it...

203
00:14:57,141 --> 00:15:00,269
...l constantly find myself
without 20s, and you...

204
00:15:00,478 --> 00:15:02,309
...always have lots.

205
00:15:07,752 --> 00:15:10,016
You should've seen
the look on her face.

206
00:15:10,288 --> 00:15:13,780
l don't want Rachel to hate me.
l don't know what to do.

207
00:15:13,991 --> 00:15:16,118
-You want my advice?
-Yes. Please.

208
00:15:16,494 --> 00:15:18,985
-You won't like it.
-That's okay.

209
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:22,095
You got married too fast.

210
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:26,101
-That's not advice.
-l told you.

211
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,271
l'm going to the bathroom.

212
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:37,310
lf anyone asked me to give up
any of you, l couldn't do it.

213
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:38,437
Me neither.

214
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,381
Maybe l could do it.

215
00:15:46,123 --> 00:15:48,887
l know you guys heard about
me and Ross.

216
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,563
But l've been obsessing about it
and would love not to talk about it.

217
00:15:53,831 --> 00:15:56,891
l don't know if this falls
under that category...

218
00:15:57,134 --> 00:15:59,227
...but Ross is right back there.

219
00:15:59,904 --> 00:16:02,134
-That's not Ross.
-Not that guy.

220
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,171
He does look like him, though.

221
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,473
Ross is in the bathroom.

222
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:11,681
Oh, my God! lt's happening.
lt's already started. l'm Kip.

223
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,043
Yeah, you're not Kip.

224
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:16,513
Do you even know who Kip is?

225
00:16:17,488 --> 00:16:19,922
Who cares? You're Rachel.

226
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,659
Who's Kip?

227
00:16:24,028 --> 00:16:26,553
My old roommate.
We all hung out together.

228
00:16:26,764 --> 00:16:28,698
Oh, that poor bastard.

229
00:16:29,934 --> 00:16:33,062
You told me the story.
He and Monica dated.

230
00:16:33,337 --> 00:16:37,535
When they broke up, you all
promised you'd stay his friend.

231
00:16:37,742 --> 00:16:40,370
And what happened?
He got phased out.

232
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:43,240
-You won't be phased out.
-Of course l am.

233
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:47,907
lt won't happen to Ross. He's your
brother, your college roommate.

234
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:51,112
Kip didn't even have to be Kip.
We handled that all wrong.

235
00:16:51,255 --> 00:16:52,552
lt was a long time ago.

236
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:58,560
And it was before you and me were around.
They didn't know what they were doing.

237
00:16:58,696 --> 00:17:03,156
Chandler had a mustache,
for crying out loud.

238
00:17:04,168 --> 00:17:06,329
lt was just a matter of time.

239
00:17:06,571 --> 00:17:09,472
l just assumed Phoebe
would be the one to go.

240
00:17:11,676 --> 00:17:14,076
You live far away,
you're not related.

241
00:17:14,278 --> 00:17:15,745
You lift right out.

242
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:25,579
Hey, Mr. Bing.

243
00:17:26,023 --> 00:17:28,753
That hotel you stayed at called.

244
00:17:29,994 --> 00:17:32,861
Someone left an eyelash curler
in your room.

245
00:17:35,499 --> 00:17:37,194
Yes, that was mine.

246
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,932
l figured you met
a girl and she left it.

247
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:44,871
That would have made more sense.

248
00:17:46,077 --> 00:17:48,910
l don't even feel like
l know you anymore.

249
00:17:49,947 --> 00:17:53,439
All right, l'm just going
to ask you this one time.

250
00:17:53,684 --> 00:17:56,050
Whatever you say,
l'll believe you.

251
00:17:57,455 --> 00:18:00,253
Were you or were you not...

252
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:01,948
...on a gay cruise?

253
00:18:21,112 --> 00:18:23,979
l'm sorry about the whole
''lifting out'' thing.

254
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,880
You gotta come with me.

255
00:18:28,219 --> 00:18:29,652
-Where?
-Wherever l go.

256
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,321
You and me, we'll start a new group.
We're the best ones.

257
00:18:37,728 --> 00:18:40,219
Okay, but try to get Joey too.

258
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:46,565
Pheebs, do you mind if l
speak to Rachel alone?

259
00:18:46,804 --> 00:18:47,998
Sure.

260
00:18:51,108 --> 00:18:52,336
Bye, Ross.

261
00:18:52,576 --> 00:18:54,009
Forever.

262
00:19:00,518 --> 00:19:03,487
Why are you here?
lsn't this against the rules?

263
00:19:06,157 --> 00:19:07,317
l talked to Monica.

264
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:12,595
Look, l'm the one
who made the choice.

265
00:19:12,797 --> 00:19:15,493
l'm the one who's making
things change.

266
00:19:15,766 --> 00:19:19,202
So l should be the one to,
you know, step back.

267
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,439
No, no, it's okay. Really.

268
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,574
Plenty of people just see their
sisters at Thanksgiving...

269
00:19:26,844 --> 00:19:29,506
...their college roommates
at reunions...

270
00:19:29,747 --> 00:19:32,614
...and Joey at Burger King.

271
00:19:37,722 --> 00:19:38,780
ls that better?

272
00:19:42,593 --> 00:19:44,390
No, it's not better.

273
00:19:45,796 --> 00:19:47,957
l still don't get to see you.

274
00:19:50,534 --> 00:19:54,231
What would you do?
lf you were me, what would you do?

275
00:20:02,813 --> 00:20:05,976
First, l'd have said
the right name at my wedding.

276
00:20:13,324 --> 00:20:15,087
l can't believe this.

277
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,490
l know.

278
00:20:21,832 --> 00:20:23,823
l am so sorry.

279
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:27,232
l know that too.

280
00:20:35,346 --> 00:20:36,335
Hey, Rach?

281
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,983
Sorry to interrupt, but Phoebe said
you want to talk to me about a trip?

282
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,087
l just came over to drop off...

283
00:20:52,663 --> 00:20:53,960
...nothing.

284
00:20:58,202 --> 00:21:00,033
So that weekend kind of sucked.

285
00:21:00,771 --> 00:21:02,033
Yeah, it did.

286
00:21:02,773 --> 00:21:04,832
So l guess this is over?

287
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:10,673
You know, you and me.
l mean, it had to end sometime.

288
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:13,215
Why exactly?

289
00:21:13,484 --> 00:21:15,714
Because of the weekend.
We had a fight.

290
00:21:16,554 --> 00:21:18,454
Chandler, that's crazy.

291
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:21,887
lf you always gave up
after a fight...

292
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:24,821
...you'd never be with anyone
longer than--

293
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:33,397
This isn't over?

294
00:21:35,406 --> 00:21:37,203
You are so cute!

295
00:21:39,844 --> 00:21:42,574
No, no. lt was a fight.

296
00:21:42,813 --> 00:21:47,045
You deal with it and you move on.
lt's nothing to freak out about.

297
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:49,479
Really? Okay, great!

298
00:21:51,922 --> 00:21:54,652
Welcome to an adult relationship.

299
00:21:57,895 --> 00:21:59,863
We're in a relationship?

300
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:03,900
l'm afraid so.

301
00:22:12,843 --> 00:22:15,937
l heard you saw Donald Trump
at your convention.

302
00:22:16,213 --> 00:22:18,272
Saw him waiting for an elevator.

303
00:22:21,785 --> 00:22:24,276
Can l use your eyelash curler?
l lost mine.

304
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:25,920
lt's in the bathroom.

305
00:22:33,097 --> 00:22:35,292
Can l talk to you for a second?

306
00:22:48,412 --> 00:22:49,606
Yes.

307
00:22:50,414 --> 00:22:51,711
Yes.

308
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,281
You?

309
00:22:54,418 --> 00:22:55,544
And you?

310
00:22:56,787 --> 00:22:59,221
But you cannot tell anyone.
No one knows.

311
00:22:59,456 --> 00:23:01,287
But how? When?

312
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:04,124
-lt happened in London.
-ln London!

313
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:10,596
We didn't want to make
a big deal out of it.

314
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:14,497
But it is a big deal!
l have to tell someone!

315
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,364
You can't.

316
00:23:17,508 --> 00:23:21,842
-Please. Now, l know this is hard.
-lt is. lt hurts.

317
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:27,307
We just don't want to deal with
telling everyone.

318
00:23:27,518 --> 00:23:29,986
Please just promise you won't tell.

319
00:23:33,557 --> 00:23:34,785
All right.

320
00:23:36,694 --> 00:23:39,128
Man, this is unbelievable!

321
00:23:39,363 --> 00:23:41,228
l mean, it's great!

322
00:23:41,465 --> 00:23:43,057
But....

323
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,562
l know. lt's great!

324
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,297
l don't want to see that!

325
00:23:51,642 --> 00:23:53,507
We're so stupid.

326
00:23:54,144 --> 00:23:58,308
Do you know what's going on in there?
They're trying to take Joey!

327
00:24:03,354 --> 00:24:07,484
''The most popular Phoebe in tennis
is called the overhand Phoebe.

328
00:24:07,858 --> 00:24:12,261
lf you win, slap your opponent
on the Phoebe and say, 'Hi, Phoebe!'''

329
00:24:13,163 --> 00:24:15,996
That's cute.
We really all enjoyed it.

330
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,325
-But it doesn't count.
-For what?

331
00:24:18,502 --> 00:24:21,903
Just count in our heads
as good Mad Libs.

332
00:24:23,273 --> 00:24:25,241
-l gotta go.
-Fun's over.

333
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:28,070
Wait, if we follow the rules...

334
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:30,610
...it's still fun
and it means something.

335
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:32,213
l'm going to take off.

336
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,509
Guys, rules are good!

337
00:24:34,752 --> 00:24:36,720
Rules help control the fun.
