1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:03,999
Who the winny-binny boy?

2
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:09,000
You the winny-winny-binny-binny boy!

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,701
Don't cry.

4
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:15,005
Don't cry.

5
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:19,014
Why is he still crying?

6
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:24,022
Don't worry. Nothing can't
be solved by happy keys.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,027
Yeah, I was feel much better when
someone shaked Jacks medal in my face.

8
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,288
Let me hold him for a sec.

9
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:34,931
Here we go.

10
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:37,132
There we are.

11
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,063
Maybe it's me.

12
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:44,307
Don't be silly. Ben loves you.
He's just being Mr. Cranky Pants.

13
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,204
You know, I once dated
a Miss Cranky Pants.

14
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,915
Lovely girl. Kind of moody.

15
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,581
There we go, all better.

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,154
There's my little boy.

17
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,926
Can I see something?

18
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:19,642
Cool!

19
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,347
He hates me.
My nephew hates me!

20
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,542
I'm unemployed, and my nephew hates me!

21
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:27,780
Stop, don't do this.
You are just unemployed.

22
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:32,718
What if my own baby hates me?
What do I do then?

23
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,449
Monica, stop! This is nuts.

24
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:38,696
Do you know how long it'll be before
you have to deal with this problem?

25
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,227
You don't even have a boyfriend yet.

26
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,799
Joey, she does not look fat.

27
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:52,068
The One With the Baby on the Bus

28
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,752
Here you go.

29
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,156
Goo, goo, goo!

30
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:47,298
That is so funny!
Let me see that a sec.

31
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:55,737
You okay?

32
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,237
I don't know.

33
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,969
What's in this pie?

34
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:04,843
I don't know. Butter and eggs
and flour and lime and kiwi

35
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,211
Kiwi? Kiwi?!

36
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,386
You said it was a key lime pie.

37
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:13,524
No, I didn't. I said kiwi lime.
That's what makes it so special.

38
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,794
That's what's gonna kill me.

39
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,061
I'm allergic to kiwi.

40
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,329
No, you're not. You're allergic
to lobster and peanuts and

41
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:26,833
Oh, my God!

42
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,836
It's definitely getting worse.

43
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,267
Is your tongue swelling up?

44
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,372
Either that or my mouth
is getting smaller!

45
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,342
Get your coat.
We're going to the hospital.

46
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,814
- Will he be okay?
- He's gotta get a shot.

47
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,386
You know, actually,
it's getting better. It is.

48
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,989
Let's not go.
Anyone up for Scrabble?

49
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,922
Jacket, now!

50
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,592
What about Ben? We can't
bring a baby to the hospital.

51
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,060
We'll watch him.

52
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:56,958
I don't think so.

53
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:02,537
I have seven Catholic sisters.
I've taken care of hundreds of kids.

54
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,976
Come on, we want to do it.
Don't we?

55
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,304
I was gonna play basketball...

56
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,445
...but I guess that's out the window.

57
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,710
If you take him out for a walk,
remember to bring his hat.

58
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,717
There's milk in the refrigerator
and diapers in the bag.

59
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,389
Hat, milk...

60
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,421
Got it!

61
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,400
Consider it done!

62
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:31,733
You understood?

63
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,838
My uncle Sal has a really big tongue.

64
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,004
Is he the one
with the beautiful wife?

65
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:48,452
You want to hear the song
I'm singing this afternoon?

66
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:51,212
I wrote it this morning in the shower.

67
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:57,996
I'm in the shower
And I'm writing a song

68
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:02,329
Stop me if you've heard it

69
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:08,503
My skin is soapy and my hair is wet

70
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:12,905
And Tegrin spelled backward is nirget

71
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:20,812
Rachel, sweetheart,
could I see you for a minute?

72
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,818
What's up?

73
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,087
FYI:

74
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:32,558
I've decided to pay a professional
musician to play here on Sundays.

75
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,929
Her name is Stephanie something.
She's supposed to be very good.

76
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,195
But what about Phoebe?

77
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,937
It's not that your friend is bad.

78
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,869
It's that she's so bad...

79
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,110
...she makes me want to put my finger
through my eye into my brain...

80
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,012
...and swirl it around.

81
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,522
Okay, so you're not a fan.

82
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,293
But, I mean, come on.
You cannot do this to her.

83
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:07,822
I have to do this to her?

84
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,159
Lather, rinse, repeat

85
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,597
And lather, rinse, repeat

86
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,297
And lather, rinse, repeat

87
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,237
As needed

88
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,543
We didn't bring enough stuff.

89
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,777
Did you forget to pack
the baby's anvil?

90
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,887
I'm telling you, it'll be worth it.

91
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,959
It's a known fact
that women love babies.

92
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:38,823
Women love guys who love babies.
It's the sensitive thing.

93
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:43,700
Aim him at that pack of babes.
Maybe one of them will break away.

94
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,669
Wait, forget them.
We got one. Hard left.

95
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,771
- Give me the baby.
- No, I got him.

96
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,168
Come on, seriously.

97
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,311
Oh, seriously, you want him?

98
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,508
Who is this little cutie-pie?

99
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,647
Well, don't think me immodest, but...

100
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,322
...me.

101
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:06,690
Want to smell him?

102
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,018
I assume we're talking about the baby?

103
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:15,030
He's got that great baby smell.
Get a whiff of his head.

104
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,133
My uterus just skipped a beat.

105
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,532
What'd I tell you?

106
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,308
It's great you're doing this.

107
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,677
Well, we are great guys.

108
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,005
My brother and his boyfriend
have been trying to adopt.

109
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,648
What agency did you two go through?

110
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,846
But this is my gig.

111
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,523
This is where I play.

112
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,227
My name is written out there in chalk.

113
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,191
You know, you can't just erase chalk.

114
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:49,827
Honey, I'm sorry.

115
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,366
And he's going to
be paying this woman?

116
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,438
Why doesn't he just give her
a throne and a crown?

117
00:07:55,741 --> 00:08:00,644
And, like, a gold stick
with a ball on top?

118
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:05,039
Terry is a jerk! That's why
we always say, "Terry's a jerk!"

119
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,717
That's where that came from.

120
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,991
You probably did everything you could.

121
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,196
You know what? Let me just
see what else I could do.

122
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,035
Just let her go on after
Stephanie whatever her name is.

123
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,601
You won't be here.
You don't pay her.

124
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,468
I don't know.

125
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,572
I'll clean the cappuccino machine!

126
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,142
You don't clean
the cappuccino machine?

127
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,544
Of course I clean it.

128
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,513
I mean, I will clean it.

129
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,277
I mean, I will clean it.

130
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:45,422
All right, fine, fine, fine!

131
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,794
- Done.
- Really?

132
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,554
Who's working for you, babe?

133
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,930
Oh, my God! This is so exciting!
How much am I gonna get?

134
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,160
What?

135
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,237
He's paying the people
who were playing.

136
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:09,179
I meant, he's paying that other woman
because she's a professional.

137
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,549
I'm not gonna be the only one
who's not getting paid.

138
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,549
I'm sorry, no!

139
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:20,288
No, I'm not some sloppy second,
you know, charity band.

140
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,994
There are thousands of places
in this city...

141
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,958
...where people would pay
to hear me play.

142
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,132
When I play, I play for me

143
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,358
I don't need your charity

144
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,035
Thank you!

145
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,545
I'm not getting a shot.
Maybe they can take the needle...

146
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:47,412
...and squirt it into my mouth.
Like a squirt gun.

147
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,323
Hello there. I'm Dr. Carlin.

148
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:59,490
I see someone's having
a little allergic reaction.

149
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,233
Doctor, can I see you
for just a moment?

150
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:08,134
My brother has
a slight phobia about needles.

151
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,205
Did you tell him
about my squirt gun idea?

152
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,210
My brother, the Ph.D.,
would like to know...

153
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,042
...if there's any way
to treat this orally?

154
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:23,150
Under these circumstances, it has to be
an injection, and it has to be now.

155
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,350
So?

156
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:31,691
Go and have a seat. The doctor
says it's got to be a needle.

157
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:36,698
You're just going to have to be brave.
Can you do that for me?

158
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,740
Oh, boy! You are doing so good.

159
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,443
You want to squeeze my hand?

160
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,404
Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.

161
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,117
Honey, really.
Don't squeeze it so hard!

162
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,080
Let go of my hand!

163
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,191
Good plan. Next time
we want to pick up women...

164
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,893
...we should go to
the park and make out.

165
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,919
Taxi! Taxi!

166
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,461
Look at that talent.

167
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,962
Just practicing. You're good.

168
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,434
Carry on.

169
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,733
Wait, wait, wait!

170
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,539
Hey, you. He's just adorable.

171
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:25,945
Can you tell him that?
Because he thinks he looks too pink.

172
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:30,886
- What are you guys out doing today?
- We're not out.

173
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,459
We're two heterosexual guys
hanging with the son...

174
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:40,222
...of our other heterosexual friend,
doing the usual straight-guy stuff.

175
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,561
You done?

176
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:44,792
There's our stop.

177
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,164
Get out of here!
This is our stop.

178
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,272
You guys live around here too?

179
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,407
We live in the building
by the sidewalk.

180
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,146
You know it?

181
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:02,478
Since we're neighbors, what do you say
we get together for a drink?

182
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,621
So you want to go to Markel's?

183
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,086
Sure, they love us over there.

184
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:13,993
Where's your baby?

185
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,165
Ben! Ben!

186
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:26,111
That's good. Maybe he'll
hear you and pull the cord!

187
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,811
Stop the bus!

188
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,288
Are you sure he didn't break it?
It's really hurt.

189
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,653
No, it's just a good bone bruise.

190
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,430
And right here is
the puncture wound from your ring.

191
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,162
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

192
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:52,665
Sorry.

193
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:56,641
Sorry! I got my S's back!

194
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,970
Which we can celebrate later.

195
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,671
Celebrate. Celebrate...

196
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,612
He was a double, double

197
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,752
Double-jointed boy

198
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:14,459
So are you the
professional guitar player?

199
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,517
Yeah, I'm Stephanie.

200
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:21,063
Right. My name was on there,
but now it just says carrot cake.

201
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,464
So how many chords do you know?

202
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,505
- All of them.
- So you know D?

203
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:32,803
Do you know A-minor?

204
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,439
Do you know how to go
from D to A-minor?

205
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,620
So does your guitar have a strap?

206
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:49,819
Mine does.

207
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,827
Stephanie knows all the chords

208
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,233
Come on! Pick up, pick up!

209
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,566
Transit Authority?

210
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,037
I'm doing research for a book.

211
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:10,874
I was wondering what somebody might do
if they left a baby on a city bus.

212
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,846
Yes, I realize that would be
a stupid character.

213
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,681
Here's the deal:
We lost a car seat on a bus.

214
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:21,324
It's white plastic and
it fits onto a stroller.

215
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,357
And there was a baby in it.

216
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:25,991
He wants to talk to you.

217
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:31,366
Everybody, let's give a warm
Central Perk welcome to

218
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,402
Terry's a jerk
And he won't let me work

219
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,540
And I hate Central Perk

220
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,647
To Stephanie Schiffer!

221
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:53,191
I'd like to start with a song I wrote
for the first man I ever loved.

222
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,687
Zachary

223
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:01,095
Are all invited to bite me

224
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,908
We're the guys that called
about the baby! Is he here?!

225
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,337
He's here.

226
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,475
I assume one of you is the father.

227
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,219
- That's me.
- I'm him.

228
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:29,055
Actually, we're both the father.

229
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,471
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy.

230
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,346
Please tell me you know
which one is our baby.

231
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,917
That one has ducks on his T-shirt
and this one has clowns.

232
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,178
And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.

233
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,082
Or clowns.

234
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,293
That one's Ben! Remember he had
that cute little mole by his mouth!

235
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,425
Hey, Ben! Remember us?

236
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,201
Okay, the mole came off.

237
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,629
What are we gonna do?

238
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,670
We'll flip for it.
Ducks or clowns.

239
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,002
- Flip for the baby?
- You got a better idea?

240
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,210
All right, call it in the air.

241
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:23,806
Heads.

242
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,209
Heads, it is.

243
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:31,017
We have to assign heads to something!

244
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,488
Right!

245
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,958
Ducks is heads
because ducks have heads.

246
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:47,902
What kind of scary-ass clowns
came to your birthday?

247
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:30,278
Just call me angel
Of the morning, angel

248
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:35,212
Just touch my cheek
Before you leave me, baby

249
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,547
Just call me angel
Of the morning, angel

250
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:43,352
Then slowly turn away

251
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:48,531
I won't beg you to stay

252
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,634
With me

253
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:49,280
Here. I thought you might be cold.

254
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,715
Thank you.

255
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,060
Look at you!
You did pretty well.

256
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,527
$8. 27.

257
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,435
But not really, because
I put in the first two.

258
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:12,037
Just to get the ball rolling
and to make myself feel better.

259
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:13,702
Do you?

260
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:19,310
You know, this whole playing
for money thing is so not good for me.

261
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,512
I don't know, when I
sang "Su-su-suicide"...

262
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:28,484
...I got, like, $1.75.

263
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,791
But then "Smelly Cat"?

264
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,565
I got 25 cents and a condom.

265
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:40,799
So, you know, now I just feel
really bad for "Smelly Cat."

266
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:47,503
Honey, I don't think
everybody gets "Smelly Cat."

267
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:52,615
I mean, if all you've ever actually
had are healthy pets, then whoosh!

268
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,051
But it's not even that, you know?

269
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:00,120
I used to do my songs
because it made me happy.

270
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:04,227
Now it's just all
about the money, you know?

271
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,093
Well, people missed you in there.

272
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:12,495
In fact, there was actually
a request for "Smelly Cat."

273
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,371
Really? From who?

274
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,201
Well, me.

275
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:22,072
And I know it's not your big
money song, but it's my favorite.

276
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,751
Did I accidentally drop
a condom in your case?

277
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,651
It's kind of an emergency.

278
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,361
- Here you go.
- Thanks a lot.

279
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,825
Hey, Christine! I got it!

280
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:50,039
I want to thank you
for being there for me.

281
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,573
And I'm sorry
I almost broke your hand.

282
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,542
That's okay.
I'm sorry I poisoned you.

283
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:00,710
Remember the time I jammed
that pencil into your hand?

284
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,283
Remember it? What do
you think this is, a freckle?

285
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:10,122
What about the time I hit you
in the face with Sylvian's pumpkin?

286
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,920
Remember when I stuck
that broom in your spokes...

287
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,461
...and you hit your head on the curb?

288
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,467
But I remember
people telling me about it.

289
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,308
I hope Ben has a little sister.

290
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,077
And I hope she can kick his ass.

291
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,477
I'm gonna get a new Band-Aid.

292
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,314
How about the time I cut
the legs off your Malibu Ken?

293
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,415
That was you?

294
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,084
They were infected.
He wouldn't have made it.

295
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,595
My little nephew.

296
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,494
Come here, little one!

297
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:54,271
There's my little baby, Ben!

298
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,541
Hey, he's not crying!

299
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,749
Hey, he's not crying!

300
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,850
There's still pie!

301
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,022
I'm here. I'm here.

302
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,765
How's my little boy?

303
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:25,363
You want Daddy to change
your diaper? I know, I know.

304
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:30,469
Did you have fun with Uncle Joey
and Uncle Chandler today?

305
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,510
He rode the bus today.

306
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,877
Big boy riding the bus

307
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,615
Hey, I have a question.

308
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:48,215
How come it says,
"Property of Human Services"?

309
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,756
You are gonna love this.

310
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,102
Can you hold Ben for a sec?

311
00:23:59,037 --> 00:23:59,935
Come here. Come here.

312
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:03,264
Stay back! I've got kiwi!
Run, Joey, run!

313
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:12,312
Smelly cat, smelly cat

314
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,643
What are they feeding you?

315
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:16,454
No, no. I'm sorry, it's:

316
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:19,816
Smelly cat, smelly cat

317
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:27,925
Smelly cat, smelly cat

318
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,622
Better!

319
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:30,926
Much better. Good.

320
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:33,797
Don't feel bad,
because it's a hard song.

321
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,440
- You want to try it again?
- From the top?

322
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:41,271
There is no "top," all right?

323
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,039
That's the beauty of "Smelly Cat."

324
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,150
Why don't you just follow me.

325
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:53,916
Smelly cat, smelly cat

326
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,956
What are they feeding you?

327
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,656
Smelly cat, smelly cat

328
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,993
It's not your fault

329
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,134
That's too much. Sorry.
