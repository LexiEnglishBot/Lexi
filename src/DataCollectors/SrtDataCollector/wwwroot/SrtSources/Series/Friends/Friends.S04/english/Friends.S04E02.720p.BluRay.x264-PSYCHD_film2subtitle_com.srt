1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,673
Wow. That ripped.

2
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,385
That ripped real nice.

3
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:16,098
How many times do I have to tell you?
You turn and slide.

4
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,017
You know? Turn and slide.

5
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,102
No, you don't turn and slide.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,854
You throw it out.

7
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,275
I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot
every time I get dressed.

8
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,529
Well, we're not throwing it out.
I built this thing with my own hands.

9
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,905
All right.

10
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,866
How about we sell it?

11
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,202
All right.

12
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,164
But you're gonna have to tell them.

13
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,296
You mind if we stick you in a different
cabinet? They seem all right with it.

14
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,891
Monica, it's Chip.
- Yes.

15
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,351
- Who's Chip?
- Shh.

16
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,103
It was good running into you today.

17
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,023
So, uh, here's my number. 555-9323.
Give me a call. Later.

18
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,484
Chip is Chip Matthews.

19
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,446
The guy who took Rachel to the prom?
Why's he calling you?

20
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,534
Because I ran into him at the bank.
He is still so cute.

21
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,538
Monica, you're so lucky.
He's, like, the most popular guy in school.

22
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,415
I know.

23
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,753
Chip? Hi, it's Monica.

24
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:17,594
Okay.

25
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,471
Okay. Goodbye.

26
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,975
Oh, my God.
We just had the best conversation.

27
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,567
- I was just leaving.
- Good.

28
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,819
Because I've got a product report
to read.

29
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,739
It's, like, eight pages.
I hope I don't fall asleep.

30
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,449
Why? Did you write it?

31
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,371
Whoa.

32
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,956
Look at that.

33
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,168
Chip Matthews called.
I wonder what he wants.

34
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,254
Well, uh, actually...

35
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,967
I bet he sensed that I was ready
to have sex with another guy.

36
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,765
Well, um...

37
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,685
Why don't you give him a call?

38
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,860
Okay.

39
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:22,201
- Are you sure you want to hear this?
- Oh, I'm sure.

40
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,372
Chip. Hi, it's Rachel.

41
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,333
Rachel Green.

42
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,461
Yeah. Um, you left me a message?

43
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,673
Yes, you did.
My roommate wrote it down.

44
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,927
Monica Geller?

45
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,806
Oh.

46
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,560
Oh, that's right.

47
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,732
He called to ask out Monica.

48
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,611
That's got to be embarrassing.

49
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:06,328
Dumb drunken bitch

50
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,709
Thank you. Thanks. Ha, ha.

51
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,338
Now here's a question.

52
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,591
Where'd you guys get the "finest oak
east of the Mississippi"?

53
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,512
Uh-uh. First you tell us where you got
the prettiest lace in all the land.

54
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,430
I'm reading your ad.

55
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,141
- Looks good, huh?
- Yeah.

56
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:31,812
"Stunning entertainment center, fine...

57
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,524
Fine Italian craftsmanship."

58
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:40,028
Oh, my God. You guys are selling
the entertainment center?

59
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,114
- Why? I love that thing.
- You want it?

60
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,199
- Oh, no.
- No.

61
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,202
Uh, Gepetto?

62
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,455
Five thousand dollars?

63
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,416
Are you insane?

64
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,544
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks.

65
00:04:55,712 --> 00:05:00,757
All right, look, I'm changing it to $50
or your best offer.

66
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:05,095
What kind of profit is that?
And you call yourself an accountant?

67
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,223
No.

68
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,644
Oh.

69
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,647
What do you do?

70
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,151
I can't believe you don't know
what I do for a living.

71
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,237
- I actually don't know.
- Yeah, something to do with numbers?

72
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,036
Oh, my God, no. Shoo, kitty. No.

73
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:32,539
No, no. Shoo. Come on, you. Come on.

74
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,082
Crazy.

75
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,793
- Oh, my God.
- What?

76
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,212
Nothing. Nothing.

77
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,672
What? What's wrong?

78
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,883
I just...

79
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,889
I just have this really strong feeling
that this cat is my mother.

80
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,934
You mean, the mom you met in Montauk?
She was a cat?

81
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,313
No. No, no. She was a human lady.

82
00:05:56,481 --> 00:06:00,192
This is the spirit of my mom, Lily.
The one that killed herself.

83
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,818
Are you sure she's in the cat?

84
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:05,072
Or have you been taking your grandma's
glaucoma medicine again?

85
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,325
No, Dr. Skeptismo.

86
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,496
I'm sure. First of all,
okay, there's the feeling.

87
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:18,085
Okay, and for another, how about the fact
that she went into my guitar case...

88
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,545
...which is lined with orange felt.

89
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,635
My mother's favorite fish
was orange roughy.

90
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,557
Cats like fish.

91
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,813
Hi, Mommy.

92
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,568
Oh. I haven't seen this smile in 17 years.

93
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,408
- Dude, Phoebe's mom's got a huge pair of...
- Let it go.

94
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,995
Hey.

95
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,250
Um, when were you gonna tell me
that you're going out with Chip Matthews?

96
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,377
Now?

97
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:05,841
- Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
- No. It's not okay.

98
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,718
I can't believe you'd want to
after what he did to me.

99
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,262
What, that thing at the prom?

100
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,267
Monica, I couldn't find him for two hours.
He was having sex with Amy Welsh.

101
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,896
Come on, that was back in high school.
How could that still bother you?

102
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,858
I mean, why of all people
do you have to go out with Chip?

103
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,776
Look, you and I went to different schools.

104
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,946
Okay, that doesn't help because
we went to the same high school.

105
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,198
You went to one
where you were popular.

106
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,534
And you got to ride off
on Chip's motorcycle...

107
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,494
...and wear his letterman jacket.

108
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:38,915
I went to one where I wore a band uniform
that you had to have specially made.

109
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,752
They had to have that specially made?

110
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,299
It was a project
for one of the Home Ec. Classes.

111
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,721
Oh, my God.
They told us that was for the mascot.

112
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,435
Back then I thought
that I'd never, ever get the chance...

113
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,395
...to go out with a Chip Matthews.

114
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,482
And now he's called me up
and asked me out.

115
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:07,736
And the fat girl inside of me
really wants to go. I owe her this.

116
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,654
I never let her eat.

117
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,074
- Oh, you go out with him.
- Oh, really?

118
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,284
Yeah.

119
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,578
If it's possible,
could you leave him somewhere...

120
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,705
...and go have sex with another guy?

121
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,790
I'll try.

122
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,255
So you guys having any luck
getting rid of the entertainment center?

123
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,049
There were a couple calls last night...

124
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,760
...but, uh, I don't think any of them
are gonna work out.

125
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,055
Yes, Joey has a very careful
screening process.

126
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,517
Apparently not everyone is qualified
to own wood and nails.

127
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,686
Stop it. Stop it.

128
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,564
She keeps squirming
and trying to get away.

129
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,691
Just like when she was alive.

130
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,279
So, Pheebs, how long is your mom
gonna be with us?

131
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,198
Well, I'm not sure.

132
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,284
I mean, I guess until she, you know,
gets used to the fact that there's...

133
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,662
...you know, a new mom.

134
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,542
You know, I think she's worried
that she's gonna be replaced.

135
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,503
Well, that's not gonna happen, is it? No.

136
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,381
Okay, I have to return a call
in the other room.

137
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,341
Why can't you use the phone in here?

138
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:16,221
Well, I'm returning a call from
a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H.

139
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,723
I just spelled the wrong word.

140
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:26,439
So, guys, am I crazy or does Phoebe's mom
remind anyone else of a cat?

141
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,235
- Ross, don't start.
- Come on.

142
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,656
You can't tell me you actually believe
that there's a woman inside that cat?

143
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,992
I believe it.

144
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,829
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

145
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,581
No, you...

146
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,333
You know what?

147
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,836
You're not gonna suck me into this.

148
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:52,173
Oh, sure I am.
Because you always have to be right.

149
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,467
I do not always have... Okay, okay.

150
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,140
Jurassic Park could happen.

151
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,404
Wow. That's, uh... That's pretty nice.

152
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,489
"Pretty nice"?

153
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,618
You'll have to pardon my roommate.
He wanted to marry this.

154
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:24,164
We don't have 50 bucks.
But would you be willing to trade for it?

155
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,373
We got a canoe.

156
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,717
You know,
I really don't think we need a canoe.

157
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,260
You gotta take the canoe.

158
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,889
All right, just...

159
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,308
Just take the entertainment center.

160
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,353
And then when you get home,
throw the canoe away.

161
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,564
We're not throwing it away.
I built that canoe.

162
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,400
Good for you.

163
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,618
You guys, you're never gonna believe
what I just found on a telephone pole.

164
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,370
Looks kind of familiar?

165
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:07,499
Apparently Phoebe's mother
also goes by the name Julio.

166
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,379
You guys, there's a little girl
in SoHo looking for this cat.

167
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:16,591
- I mean, you know what that means?
- Yeah, 200-dollar reward split five ways.

168
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,887
Do we have to tell her?

169
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:25,058
- Yes, we have to tell her.
- Oh, but it's made her so happy.

170
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,103
Little girl misses her cat.

171
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:32,190
Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.

172
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,527
Okay, ha, ha, you know what?
I have to go have dinner with my son.

173
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,613
Can I trust that when you see Phoebe,
you will tell her?

174
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,615
Yeah.

175
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,158
Thank you.

176
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,454
Ugh. I hate it when Ross is right.

177
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,832
- He is right, isn't he?
- You know what?

178
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,875
This might be one of the times
when he's wrong.

179
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,211
- You think?
- Oh, no, he's right.

180
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,218
- Hi.
- Hi. Hey.

181
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,179
Uh, Pheebs, ahem...

182
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,224
- About your mom, heh.
- Yeah?

183
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,937
How's that going?

184
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:14,274
So great.
Oh, we took a nap together today.

185
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,818
My mom fell asleep on my tummy
and purred.

186
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,072
That's so sweet.

187
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,076
I'm gonna get some coffee.

188
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,502
Huh? What'd you say, Joe?
I'll be right there.

189
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,259
- Pheebs...
- I just feel so...

190
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,636
- All right.
- I'm coming already.

191
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,645
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

192
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,862
- Hello, Chip.
- Hey, Rach. How you doing?

193
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,530
I'm great. I'm great.

194
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,825
Got a great job at Bloomingdale's.
I have wonderful friends.

195
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,952
And even though I'm not
seeing anyone right now...

196
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,663
...I've really never felt better
about myself.

197
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,584
So, uh, Monica ready yet?

198
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,048
She'll be out in a second.

199
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,301
So, Chip, how's, um, Amy Welsh?

200
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,638
Amy Welsh?
Wow, I haven't seen her since...

201
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,517
So, Monica about ready?

202
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,563
This is the unit for you, my friend.

203
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,608
Sturdy construction,
tons of storage compartments.

204
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,027
Some big enough to fit a grown man.

205
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:42,904
What?

206
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,782
Oh, yeah, I got in there myself once.

207
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,243
My roommate bet me 5 bucks
that I couldn't.

208
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,912
And then he stuck a board
through the handles and locked me in.

209
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,705
Ha, ha. Yeah.

210
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,708
It was funny till I started feeling
like I was in a coffin.

211
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:01,214
No, you... You can't fit in that thing.
That's not deep enough.

212
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,216
Oh, yeah?

213
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,761
If I can't...

214
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,347
...I'll knock 5 bucks off the price
of the unit.

215
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,766
- All right, you have yourself a deal.
- Okay.

216
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,232
See? I told you.

217
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,904
Sometimes I come in here
just to get away from it.

218
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,950
Hey, a nickel.

219
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,581
Here we are.

220
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,833
Oh, my God, you still have the Chipper.

221
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,501
The what?

222
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:42,297
That's what we used to call
your, uh, motorcycle in high school.

223
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,382
You know, a motorcycle's a chopper.

224
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,467
And you're Chip.

225
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,303
Never mind.

226
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,972
No, I think it's cute.

227
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,352
Wow.

228
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,521
A lipper from the Chipper.

229
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,775
So are you still in touch
with anyone from high school?

230
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,153
Um, there's Rachel...

231
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,239
...and that's it. How about you?

232
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,617
Oh, yeah, I still hang
with Simens and Zana.

233
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,661
You know, and I see Spindler a lot,
and Levine, Kelly.

234
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,830
And I run into Goldie
from time to time...

235
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,416
...Stick, Brown, Sulkov, McGuire...

236
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,835
...J.T., Beardsley.

237
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,462
Is that all?

238
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,673
Ah, you know, after high school,
you just kind of lose touch.

239
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,010
Oh, yeah, I ran into Richard Dorfman.

240
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,678
- Oh, how is he?
- Not so good.

241
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,306
Me and Simens gave him a wedgie.
Ha-ha-ha.

242
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,310
- Isn't he an architect now?
- Yeah, they still wear underwear.

243
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,367
Oh, my God.

244
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,537
What?

245
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,793
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

246
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,837
What happened?

247
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:08,967
Oh, man, he promised
he wouldn't take the chairs.

248
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,511
What the hell happened?
How were you locked in there?

249
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,055
Where the hell is all of our stuff?

250
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,516
Well, this guy came by
to look at the unit...

251
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,435
...and he said he didn't think
it was big enough to fit a grown man.

252
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,730
So you got in voluntarily?

253
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,608
I was trying to make a sale.

254
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,112
Oh, man. If I ever run into that guy again,
you know what I'm gonna do?

255
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,239
Bend over?

256
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,871
And then Zana just let one rip.

257
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,463
Look, not that I don't enjoy talking about
people who we went to high school with...

258
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,674
- ...because I do.
- Ha, ha.

259
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,176
But, um, maybe we can talk
about something else.

260
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,721
Like you.
I don't even know where you work.

261
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,306
- You know where I work.
- I do?

262
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,393
The movie theater.
You used to come in all the time.

263
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:05,940
- You still work at the Multiplex?
- Like I'd give up that job. Ha, ha.

264
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,068
Free popcorn and candy
any time I want?

265
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,946
- I can get you free posters for your room.
- Thanks, I'm set.

266
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,575
Do you live with your parents?

267
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,952
Yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.

268
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,377
Wow, they really got you guys.
Your TV, the chairs.

269
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,297
Yeah, your microwave, the stereo.

270
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,884
Oh, man, he took the five of spades.

271
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,553
Oh, no, no, here it is.

272
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,098
Oh, my God. What happened?

273
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:43,936
Oh. Um, Joey was born, and then
28 years later, I was robbed.

274
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,817
So how was your date?

275
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:53,404
Well, you know how I always wanted
to go out with Chip in high school?

276
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:57,825
Well, tonight, I actually went out
with Chip Matthews in high school.

277
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,244
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

278
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,331
No, it's okay. Not only did I get
to go out with Chip Matthews...

279
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,291
...I got to dump Chip Matthews.

280
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,336
- Oh, that's so great.
- I know.

281
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,130
- Hey.
- Hey.

282
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,299
So, uh,
what did the insurance company say?

283
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,509
Oh, they said, uh:

284
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:18,012
"You don't have insurance here,
so stop calling us."

285
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,809
You didn't tell her?

286
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,523
Okay, fine.

287
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,817
- Pheebs?
- Yeah. Hi.

288
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:34,112
Hi. Listen, uh...

289
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,657
...this cat belongs to a little girl.

290
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,119
All right?
There are flyers all over the place.

291
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,496
I'm sorry, sweetie.

292
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,749
Hey, we can take her
back with you if you want.

293
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,586
Oh. Mm-hm.

294
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:54,257
But, you know, she chose to find me.

295
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,759
I mean, I have to respect her decision,
right?

296
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,055
- That's a good call.
- That's right.

297
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,808
No, no. Hey, enough is enough.

298
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,394
Look, I'm sorry
that you feel guilty or whatever...

299
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:10,106
...about spending time with your new mom.
But this is not your old mom.

300
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,774
This is a cat. Okay?

301
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,569
Julio the cat.

302
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,612
Not Mom. Cat.

303
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,579
It's okay.

304
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,249
Ross, how many parents have you lost?

305
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,751
None.

306
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,630
Okay, then you don't know what it feels like
when one of them comes back. Do you?

307
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,429
I believe this is my mother.

308
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,931
Even if I'm wrong, who cares?

309
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,560
Just be a friend, okay? Be supportive.

310
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,148
I'm sorry.

311
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,734
Okay.

312
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,404
I don't know what to say. Heh.

313
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:05,119
You could say you're sorry to her mom.

314
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,920
I think she would like that.

315
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,725
Come here. Here, come here, come here.

316
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,687
Mrs. Buffay?

317
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,317
Sorry about what I said.

318
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:40,780
Um, it was insensitive of me to say...

319
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,282
...that you were just a cat.

320
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:50,831
When, clearly, you are also
the reincarnated spirit...

321
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,458
...of my friend's mother.

322
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,088
Thank you.

323
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,757
- We both forgive you.
- Heh.

324
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,427
What are you gonna do
about the little girl?

325
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,347
Yeah. Okay, listen.

326
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:10,851
Um, Mom, I hope you know
that you still mean a lot to me.

327
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,604
And you're welcome
to come back any time.

328
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,481
Pheebs?

329
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:19,235
If she could come back as a couch,
we'd really appreciate it.

330
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,780
Come on, Mom,
I'm gonna take you home.

331
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,116
- I'll go with you.
- Me too.

332
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,078
Oh, uh, you know, I got an extra futon.

333
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,165
Dude, you don't have to brag.
We got nothing here.
