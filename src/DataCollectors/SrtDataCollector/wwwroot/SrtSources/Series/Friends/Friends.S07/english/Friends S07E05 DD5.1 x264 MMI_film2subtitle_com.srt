1
00:00:03,488 --> 00:00:07,616
- What's the matter?
- Somebody on the subway licked my neck!

2
00:00:07,871 --> 00:00:09,947
Willy's still alive!

3
00:00:11,072 --> 00:00:12,982
- What are you guys doing?
- My mom called.

4
00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:15,376
They're announcing
our engagement in the paper.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,828
- We're looking for a good picture of us.
- I'm afraid that does not exist.

6
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:22,616
There are great pictures of us.

7
00:00:22,936 --> 00:00:27,041
No, there are great pictures of you standing
next to a guy who's going like this:

8
00:00:28,608 --> 00:00:32,771
Oh, my God, that's the creep that
you're with at the Statue of Liberty.

9
00:00:34,174 --> 00:00:37,269
I don't know what it is.
I just can't take a good picture.

10
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:38,688
Here's a great one.

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,139
- Yeah, I'm not in that.
- No, but look at me, all tan.

12
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:46,867
Why don't you go get portraits done
by a professional photographer?

13
00:00:47,186 --> 00:00:50,827
That's a great idea. I bet they have
one of those wind machines.

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,059
Yeah, that's great. Next to that,
Chandler won't look so stupid.

15
00:00:58,494 --> 00:01:02,135
- Chandler, what do you say?
- All right, but I'm not going.

16
00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:04,157
"I'm" going.

17
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:09,164
The One With The
Engagement Picture

18
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:42,948
Dude, that reverse lay-up.

19
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:45,419
- And how about those three-pointers?
- Amazing.

20
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:49,561
And those guys were this close
to letting us play this time too.

21
00:01:53,534 --> 00:01:57,175
Hey, look. Phoebe's talking
to Cute Coffeehouse Guy.

22
00:01:57,535 --> 00:02:02,162
You call him, "Cute Coffeehouse Guy"?
We call him, "Hums While He Pees."

23
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:05,884
Yes, and we call Ross,
"Lingers in the Bathroom."

24
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:10,473
Hey, you guys, Hums While He Pees
just asked me out!

25
00:02:12,043 --> 00:02:15,139
- I thought that guy was married.
- He is, but he's getting divorced.

26
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:17,007
Ross, maybe you know him.

27
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:21,564
It's not a club.

28
00:02:22,445 --> 00:02:25,743
If he's getting a divorce,
is it such a good idea to date him?

29
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:30,721
- Hey, divorced men are not bad men.
- They have that on the napkins at the club.

30
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:35,907
- I gotta get back to work.
- You don't have to be back for a half-hour.

31
00:02:36,258 --> 00:02:39,698
My assistant, Tag, does sit-ups
in the office during lunch.

32
00:02:41,303 --> 00:02:44,043
I could just spread him on a cracker.

33
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:48,427
You have a crush on him,
why would you hire him?

34
00:02:48,713 --> 00:02:51,560
- You know you can't date him, right?
- Oh, no, I know that.

35
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,761
We made a joke that we spend
so much time together...

36
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,705
...he should call me, his "work-wife."

37
00:03:01,795 --> 00:03:05,757
Soon he'll be able to call you, "that
lady he knew that got fired."

38
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,622
I'm not gonna get fired, because
I'm not gonna act on it.

39
00:03:09,937 --> 00:03:12,084
You wouldn't mind
if he was dating someone else?

40
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:16,892
Why, is he? He is, isn't he?
He's dating that slut in marketing.

41
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:20,649
Maybe I should open
a divorced men's club.

42
00:03:21,314 --> 00:03:23,330
Dude, that's so sad.

43
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:26,633
I could put a basketball court
in the back.

44
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:28,578
Could I play?

45
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:37,246
Oh, no sit-ups today, Tag?

46
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:41,138
- I just did them.
- Well, drop and give me 10 more.

47
00:03:42,397 --> 00:03:43,713
What?

48
00:03:43,998 --> 00:03:45,836
I had a drink with lunch.

49
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:50,705
- Did those cost reports come in?
- I filled them out last night.

50
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,757
Could you make me four copies?

51
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:54,776
- Sure.
- Great, thank you.

52
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:18,505
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi, Melissa. What's up?

53
00:04:18,754 --> 00:04:22,717
I'm just about to go out to the store.

54
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:25,561
Get some stuff to put in my backpack.

55
00:04:25,852 --> 00:04:28,557
Dried fruit, and granola
and stuff like that.

56
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,682
- What's up?
- Is Tag here?

57
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:31,975
No. Why?

58
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:34,685
I was gonna talk to him
about tonight.

59
00:04:34,897 --> 00:04:39,204
Really? You got a little crush
on Tag there, do you?

60
00:04:40,116 --> 00:04:42,228
We've been flirting back and forth...

61
00:04:42,552 --> 00:04:46,514
...but I was hoping tonight it would turn
into something a little more than that.

62
00:04:46,797 --> 00:04:49,751
Easy there, Melissa.
This ain't a locker room, okay.

63
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:57,753
But, you know, I remember him saying
that he had plans tonight.

64
00:04:58,278 --> 00:05:00,496
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

65
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:03,388
All right, back to work.

66
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,413
Hey, isn't that Tag's backpack?

67
00:05:07,672 --> 00:05:12,784
I don't want to be known as the office
bitch, but I'll call your supervisor.

68
00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:23,045
Great, that's great, Monica. Great.

69
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,175
Now, Chandler, you want to
give us a smile?

70
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:27,668
Okay.

71
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,733
- I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
- No, I am.

72
00:05:35,296 --> 00:05:38,523
Chandler, I know you can do this.
You have a beautiful smile.

73
00:05:38,845 --> 00:05:40,956
- I do?
- Yeah.

74
00:05:43,194 --> 00:05:46,800
Maybe you don't have to smile.
Let's try something else.

75
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:49,381
- Try looking sexy.
- Okay.

76
00:05:56,206 --> 00:05:57,665
Or not.

77
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:05,001
Hi, Joey, what are you doing here?

78
00:06:05,217 --> 00:06:08,965
I got an audition down the street,
and I spilled sauce on my shirt.

79
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:13,318
- You got an extra one?
- Yeah, sure.

80
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:17,280
Here.

81
00:06:17,568 --> 00:06:18,884
Great.

82
00:06:19,864 --> 00:06:22,331
You got anything that's
not Ralph Lauren?

83
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,942
Yeah, I don't think so, Joe.

84
00:06:28,214 --> 00:06:29,637
I guess this'll be fine.

85
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,145
- What are you doing tonight?
- Nothing. Why?

86
00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:36,564
How would you feel about
taking out my assistant, Tag? I'll pay.

87
00:06:37,713 --> 00:06:41,876
It's gonna take a lot of money for
me to go out on a date with a dude.

88
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:46,335
I'm not asking you to go on
a date with him.

89
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:49,501
Really? Because I could kind of
use the money.

90
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:54,229
He's new in town, and I know
he doesn't have any guy friends.

91
00:06:54,552 --> 00:06:57,541
Take him to a ball game or something.
I'd really appreciate it.

92
00:06:58,135 --> 00:06:59,938
- Yeah, okay, no problem.
- Thank you.

93
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:02,618
Ooh, hey, doughnuts!

94
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:17,544
You got a red shirt?

95
00:07:20,611 --> 00:07:23,351
I know. Let's try a look...

96
00:07:23,672 --> 00:07:25,961
...of far-off wonderment.

97
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:31,738
Gaze into our future, and think about
our marriage and the days to come.

98
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:40,709
Chandler, what is the matter
with your face?

99
00:07:40,964 --> 00:07:43,846
This picture should say,
"Geller and Bing to be married,"...

100
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:47,154
...not, "Local woman saves
drowning moron."

101
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:52,502
Hey, don't laugh at him.
He's my drowning moron.

102
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:55,853
That's it, that's it!
Take it, take it!

103
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:02,802
I like this one.

104
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:06,910
It seems to say, "I love you and
that's why I have to kill you."

105
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:10,847
Can't all be bad.

106
00:08:11,476 --> 00:08:14,252
Find the one where you make
your bedroom eyes.

107
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:15,683
There it is.

108
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:19,332
Oh, my God,
those are my bedroom eyes?

109
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:22,287
Why did you ever sleep with me?

110
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:25,983
Do you really want to pull
at that thread?

111
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:32,662
- I'm really having a good time.
- Me too.

112
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,788
Sorry that guy on the subway
licked your neck.

113
00:08:37,256 --> 00:08:39,510
No, that's okay. He's a friend.

114
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,946
I don't mean to be presumptuous...

115
00:08:42,197 --> 00:08:45,151
...but I have tickets to the
ballroom-dancing finals tomorrow.

116
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,096
Yeah, I...

117
00:08:47,381 --> 00:08:51,509
Well, I missed the semifinals,
so I think I would just be lost.

118
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,696
I know that it's really lame, but I got
these tickets from my boss...

119
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:58,547
Oh, no, no, no, my God!

120
00:08:58,828 --> 00:09:00,904
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.

121
00:09:01,576 --> 00:09:03,130
It's my ex-wife, Whitney.

122
00:09:03,454 --> 00:09:06,301
I cannot deal with her now.
That woman is crazy.

123
00:09:06,551 --> 00:09:08,105
Okay, I know. Hold on.

124
00:09:09,265 --> 00:09:10,795
- Hey, Ross.
- Yeah.

125
00:09:11,353 --> 00:09:14,342
That's Whitney, Kyle's ex-wife,
out there.

126
00:09:14,623 --> 00:09:18,300
Do you think you could divert her
so we could slip out?

127
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,533
What? No.

128
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:25,684
Okay, but I have two tickets to
the ballroom-dance finals.

129
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:28,774
I don't think so, Pheebs.

130
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:32,571
All right, I'll do it.

131
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:37,507
- But just because you're a friend.
- Okay.

132
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:53,444
Hi, Ginger.

133
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:55,319
I want my key back.

134
00:09:55,573 --> 00:09:58,005
- I don't have it.
- It's right there.

135
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:00,510
Okay, Sherlock.

136
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:03,469
I'm sorry,
but you'd better go, Pheebs.

137
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:06,808
I just wanted to thank you, though,
for diverting Kyle's ex.

138
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:09,934
You're welcome.
We'll talk about it later.

139
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:14,633
- Hi, Whitney.
- Hi, Ross.

140
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,376
- Are you ready for breakfast?
- Yep.

141
00:10:19,788 --> 00:10:23,857
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed
to divert her, not date her.

142
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:28,340
Can you give me a second
while I talk to this woman...

143
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,916
...who, by the way, did not
spend the night?

144
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:34,360
- Sure.
- Okay.

145
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:40,128
I did divert her, and we ended up
having a great time, okay?

146
00:10:40,384 --> 00:10:41,938
Watching ballroom dancing?

147
00:10:42,194 --> 00:10:45,183
Yes, that's where we realized
we were both super-cool people.

148
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:50,467
Look, Kyle just told me
some really bad stuff about her.

149
00:10:50,856 --> 00:10:53,359
- Like what?
- Like she's really mean...

150
00:10:53,605 --> 00:10:55,681
...and she's overly critical and...

151
00:10:56,041 --> 00:11:01,011
She will paint a room a really bright
color without even checking with you.

152
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,000
Okay.

153
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:07,483
And she uses sex as a weapon.

154
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,153
Thank you for warning me.

155
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:14,264
At breakfast, I'll be on alert for
room painting and sex weapons.

156
00:11:15,663 --> 00:11:18,095
- You're still gonna go out with her?
- Yeah.

157
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:20,773
Well, didn't you hear
what I just said?

158
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,043
Pheebs, come on.
I mean, consider the source.

159
00:11:24,361 --> 00:11:28,216
Of course her ex-husband's gonna say
that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me.

160
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:30,720
Listen to me, she is crazy!

161
00:11:31,911 --> 00:11:34,722
Your door isn't soundproof.

162
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:39,842
You see? Nothing is good enough
for her.

163
00:11:48,228 --> 00:11:50,861
- Excuse me.
- He's not here!

164
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:54,348
My God, do you people have
nothing better to do...

165
00:11:54,561 --> 00:11:58,143
...than to traipse into my office
and just gawk at my assistant.

166
00:11:59,431 --> 00:12:01,269
I'm Emily from upstairs.

167
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:04,889
Susan's still in the hospital, and I'm
collecting money to send her flowers.

168
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:09,063
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Okay. Yes, of course.

169
00:12:09,277 --> 00:12:13,311
Just take it all. Take it all. And
please, please, give my best to Emily.

170
00:12:13,557 --> 00:12:15,086
I'm Emily.

171
00:12:16,097 --> 00:12:18,006
Yeah. No, I meant...

172
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,169
...the other one that you said.

173
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:27,187
- Morning.
- Hi, Tag.

174
00:12:27,474 --> 00:12:31,957
- Did you have fun with Joey last night?
- Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.

175
00:12:32,623 --> 00:12:33,903
That's nice.

176
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:37,803
Then we went to a bar, and he
hooked us up with all these women.

177
00:12:40,903 --> 00:12:44,093
Women? You mean, like old women?

178
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:47,051
Kind of old, like 30.

179
00:12:53,776 --> 00:12:56,766
I never used to be able
to just talk to girls in bars...

180
00:12:57,081 --> 00:13:00,237
...but I got like 20 phone numbers
last night.

181
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,695
That's great.

182
00:13:04,979 --> 00:13:07,411
Joey must have really taught
you some stuff.

183
00:13:07,762 --> 00:13:08,734
A little.

184
00:13:10,476 --> 00:13:12,006
How you doing?

185
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:23,383
See? That's a great smile.
Easy, natural.

186
00:13:23,697 --> 00:13:25,429
Now pretend I have a camera.

187
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:29,957
- You're changing it.
- I can't help it.

188
00:13:30,238 --> 00:13:33,607
You want to know what I do
when I take résumé shots?

189
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:35,765
Borrow money from me?

190
00:13:37,057 --> 00:13:41,648
Yeah. Okay, first of all,
you want to make it look spontaneous.

191
00:13:41,963 --> 00:13:46,411
So here's what I do. I look down,
look down, keep looking down.

192
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,082
Then I look up.

193
00:13:50,904 --> 00:13:52,327
See? Now you try.

194
00:13:52,609 --> 00:13:55,835
Look down. You're looking down.
Keep looking down.

195
00:13:56,123 --> 00:13:58,104
Why is there jelly on your shoe?

196
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,432
I had a doughnut.

197
00:14:04,264 --> 00:14:07,384
So I heard you had some fun
with Tag last night.

198
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,848
Yeah, that guy's all right.

199
00:14:09,135 --> 00:14:13,168
Yeah, and you had fun teaching him
how to be all "Joey."

200
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:16,230
- What?
- You know, all the women.

201
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:19,392
You can't teach someone
to be good with women.

202
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:22,037
That's why I never had
any luck with Chandler.

203
00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:29,792
I'm right here.

204
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:34,388
Would you mind just not
going out with him again?

205
00:14:34,637 --> 00:14:37,935
Just the idea of you, and he,
and all these women...

206
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:40,582
I know he's my assistant,
and I can't date him!

207
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:42,524
But it just bothers me, all right?

208
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:45,448
No, no, no, you can't take him
away from me.

209
00:14:45,736 --> 00:14:49,413
I got a great partner to pick
up girls with. Finally!

210
00:14:53,703 --> 00:14:55,815
I'm still right here.

211
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,153
Will you at least talk to him...

212
00:14:58,469 --> 00:15:02,953
...and tell him how hollow and unsatisfying
this dating-tons-of-women thing is?

213
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,281
What?

214
00:15:06,715 --> 00:15:10,120
I just don't want him to meet anybody
until I'm over my crush.

215
00:15:10,403 --> 00:15:11,577
And I will get over it.

216
00:15:11,864 --> 00:15:14,675
It's not like I love him.
It's just physical.

217
00:15:14,995 --> 00:15:18,779
I get crushes like this all the time.
I had a crush on you at first.

218
00:15:19,205 --> 00:15:20,901
I know. Monica told me.

219
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,867
Did you have a crush on me
when we first met?

220
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,078
Yeah, sure.

221
00:15:33,122 --> 00:15:35,482
Can you people not see me?

222
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:40,145
Will you talk to him?

223
00:15:40,394 --> 00:15:44,178
- I don't know, Rach.
- I'll give you 10 free Ralph Lauren shirts.

224
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:45,743
One.

225
00:15:46,065 --> 00:15:48,638
No, 10. You said 10.
You can't take that back.

226
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,203
You wanted to talk to me?

227
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,737
I don't know.
You got something for me?

228
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:02,578
Yeah, this is from Rachel.

229
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,635
Ten. Okay.

230
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:11,140
Tag, there's such a thing
as too many women.

231
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,098
- Really?
- Yeah, for you.

232
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:26,969
Hey, how much would it cost
to get a big fan in here?

233
00:16:28,128 --> 00:16:30,310
- Hey, there you are.
- There I am.

234
00:16:30,632 --> 00:16:34,001
- You okay?
- Yeah, Joey said I needed to relax.

235
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,017
So he gave me an antihistamine.

236
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:37,799
What?

237
00:16:38,113 --> 00:16:40,580
I fell asleep on the subway
and went to Brooklyn.

238
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:43,328
Brooklyn is far.

239
00:16:44,515 --> 00:16:45,724
What were you thinking?

240
00:16:45,976 --> 00:16:49,617
But don't worry, because
I know how to take a picture now.

241
00:16:50,672 --> 00:16:53,768
Okay, see. Look down.

242
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:55,815
Look down.

243
00:16:56,413 --> 00:16:58,110
Look down.

244
00:17:03,894 --> 00:17:05,626
- Chandler?
- Yeah?

245
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:13,770
- Hi.
- Hi.

246
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:17,981
How are things going with Crazy?
Has she cooked your rabbit yet?

247
00:17:19,028 --> 00:17:22,289
Listen, you are hearing one side
of the story. Okay?

248
00:17:22,577 --> 00:17:26,183
FYI, she must have shown Kyle
over 30 paint samples...

249
00:17:26,474 --> 00:17:28,027
...before she painted that room.

250
00:17:29,569 --> 00:17:34,326
And his response to each one was,
"I don't give a tiny rat's ass."

251
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,813
Maybe she should have spent
a little less time decorating...

252
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:40,347
...and a little more time
in the bedroom.

253
00:17:40,912 --> 00:17:43,343
I don't think we are going
to have that problem...

254
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,515
...but maybe that's just because
I am not emotionally unavailable.

255
00:17:48,461 --> 00:17:50,228
You think he's
emotionally unavailable?

256
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,532
I think he can be.

257
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:54,645
Maybe he wouldn't be...

258
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:57,294
...if she didn't bring the office
home every night.

259
00:17:57,542 --> 00:18:00,876
Excuse her for knowing
what she wants to do with her life.

260
00:18:01,126 --> 00:18:05,254
Well, she certainly knew what
she was doing New Year's Eve, 1997.

261
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:09,470
I knew you were going
to throw that in my face!

262
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:13,573
That was three years ago.
She apologized and apologized.

263
00:18:13,825 --> 00:18:16,078
What more do you want?

264
00:18:16,434 --> 00:18:18,865
We want the last six years back!

265
00:18:19,114 --> 00:18:21,925
So do we! So do we!

266
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:28,809
I'm sorry you had to see that.

267
00:18:32,682 --> 00:18:34,521
- Morning, Rachel.
- Hi.

268
00:18:34,804 --> 00:18:36,951
Hey, so, what'd you do last night?

269
00:18:37,344 --> 00:18:38,933
- Went out with Joey.
- Yeah?

270
00:18:39,258 --> 00:18:42,804
Another night of bird-dogging
the chicas?

271
00:18:43,571 --> 00:18:46,109
No, we had a really good talk.

272
00:18:47,746 --> 00:18:50,072
I don't think I'm gonna do
that bar scene anymore.

273
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:53,238
Wow, I did not see that coming.

274
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,743
It's just not really who I am.

275
00:18:55,992 --> 00:18:59,990
I've always been happier when...
Why am I telling you this?

276
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:02,738
- You don't care about this stuff.
- Yes, I do.

277
00:19:04,482 --> 00:19:07,364
You were saying,
"I'm happier when I..."

278
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,107
When I'm in a relationship.

279
00:19:09,422 --> 00:19:11,605
- I love having a girlfriend.
- Really?

280
00:19:12,449 --> 00:19:14,003
Someone I can spoil, you know.

281
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:16,236
Spoil?

282
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:20,896
Let me ask you something.

283
00:19:21,112 --> 00:19:24,029
Do you believe there's one perfect
person for everyone?

284
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:26,603
I'm starting to.

285
00:19:27,723 --> 00:19:30,605
If that person's in your life,
should you do something about it?

286
00:19:30,854 --> 00:19:32,443
Yes. Hell, yes.

287
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,954
All right, then, it's settled.

288
00:19:35,202 --> 00:19:38,428
- I'm getting back together with my ex.
- I would love to!

289
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:40,140
What?

290
00:19:44,631 --> 00:19:46,090
Hello?

291
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,225
This is gonna be a while. Excuse me.

292
00:19:51,972 --> 00:19:53,075
Yeah.

293
00:19:53,607 --> 00:19:55,066
Yeah.

294
00:20:06,585 --> 00:20:07,521
My God!

295
00:20:09,786 --> 00:20:11,695
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying?

296
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:14,858
And speaking of being selfish in bed,
how's Whitney?

297
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,591
Maybe she wouldn't have to be
selfish in bed...

298
00:20:19,805 --> 00:20:22,581
...if someone else knew where
everything was.

299
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,541
Oh, he knows.

300
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,283
For the most part.

301
00:20:29,582 --> 00:20:32,120
Oh, hey.
Good, you're both here.

302
00:20:32,574 --> 00:20:34,199
We kind of need to talk.

303
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:36,635
- Both of you, together?
- What's up?

304
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:41,062
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night
to pick up a few things...

305
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:44,047
...and we got to reminiscing.

306
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:45,853
We talked most of the night...

307
00:20:46,108 --> 00:20:48,505
...and realized the reason
we're angry with each other...

308
00:20:48,753 --> 00:20:52,786
...is because there are still
feelings there.

309
00:20:54,284 --> 00:20:55,529
So...

310
00:20:58,181 --> 00:20:59,770
Oh, just say it, Kyle!

311
00:21:03,051 --> 00:21:04,296
We're gonna try again.

312
00:21:05,035 --> 00:21:08,581
What about her whining,
and her constant need for attention?

313
00:21:08,827 --> 00:21:09,930
I'm gonna work on that.

314
00:21:10,183 --> 00:21:12,437
Right, because you're so
capable of change.

315
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:16,087
You know, he hums when he pees.

316
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:22,351
- I do know.
- Makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.

317
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:25,383
We're so sorry.

318
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:30,080
That's all right. We don't need you.
I'm over it already.

319
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:33,448
Yeah, and I don't even give
a tiny rat's ass.

320
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:36,788
Yeah, we're gonna go.

321
00:21:41,044 --> 00:21:42,634
I'm sorry.

322
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:47,192
Pheebs, you were right about her.

323
00:21:48,768 --> 00:21:51,164
You know, she did try to use
sex as a weapon.

324
00:21:51,412 --> 00:21:53,488
Yeah, I hurt my back a little.

325
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:58,996
You know, he hums while he does
other stuff too.

326
00:22:01,223 --> 00:22:04,177
We're better off without them.

327
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:09,215
Even if they break up again, you better
not let him in your sad men's club.

328
00:22:09,434 --> 00:22:12,696
- Divorced men's club.
- Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.

329
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:21,186
You know, Pheebs, we don't talk
that much anymore.

330
00:22:21,403 --> 00:22:22,683
Yeah.

331
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:25,809
Hey, guys, check it out.

332
00:22:26,134 --> 00:22:29,574
- My mom sent me the paper.
- Let's see it.

333
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:35,661
- Oh, yeah, that looks good.
