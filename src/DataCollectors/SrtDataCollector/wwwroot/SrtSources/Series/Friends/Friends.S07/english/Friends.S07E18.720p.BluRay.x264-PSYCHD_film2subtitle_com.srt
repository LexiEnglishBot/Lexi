1
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:05,504
Hey, hey! Guys, you won't believe this!

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,507
- I just got off the phone with my agent...
- Oh, my God!

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,970
- I'm sorry. Too soon. You go.
- Okay.

4
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,015
I got nominated for my part
on Days of Our Lives!

5
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,143
- Oh, Joey, good for you!
- Congratulations!

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,896
- I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy!
- No, no.

7
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:26,775
- Soap Opera Digest Award?
- Nope, I'm up for a "Soapie."

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,155
Honey, is that something you're making up?

9
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:36,285
No, no, no, it's real!
And it has been since 1998.

10
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,538
Hey, Rach, Rach. I'm up for a Soapie!

11
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:41,957
Oh, my God!

12
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:46,754
Oh, my God! That is the third most
prestigious soap opera award there is!

13
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:50,758
Thank you! Well, I guess now we know
who I'm taking to the awards.

14
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:54,219
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that!
Will all the stars be there?

15
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,889
Many are scheduled to appear.

16
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,599
Oh, my God.

17
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:02,519
- Oh, my God. I can't go. I'll be too nervous!
- Okay, I'll go.

18
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:05,564
No! You are getting married.
This is all I have.

19
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:52,027
And Ernest Muhlbrat first hypothesized
that the velociraptor, when threatened...

20
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:56,156
...would expand its collar
and emit a high-pitched noise...

21
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,117
...to frighten off its predator.

22
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,618
Yes, Mr. Lewis?

23
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,121
What kind of noise?

24
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:06,917
Just a high-pitched, intimidating noise.

25
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,378
But like how?

26
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,798
Well, we... We don't know for sure.

27
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:17,886
But in my head,
it sounded something like this, uh:

28
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:34,236
Of course, this is just conjecture.

29
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,740
Ahem, okay. That's, uh...
That's all for today.

30
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,245
Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?

31
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,457
Yes, sir?

32
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:51,795
Mr. Morse, I need to talk to you
about your midterm exam.

33
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,966
- I'm afraid I had to fail you.
- Why?

34
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,178
Well, you need 60 percent to pass.

35
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,638
- What'd I get?
- Seven.

36
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,184
That's not so good.

37
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,854
No, no, it's not. What happened there, Ned?

38
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:14,735
Well, maybe you can cut me some slack.
I'm sort of in love.

39
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:18,238
I'm sorry, but that's really not my problem.

40
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,073
I'm in love with you.

41
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,537
Well, that brings me in the loop a little.

42
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,667
See, that's why I did so bad on this test.
I'm having a hard time concentrating.

43
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,587
When you're up there and you're teaching...

44
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,632
...and your face gets all serious...

45
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,762
...you look so good. When you wear
that tight little turtleneck sweater...

46
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,681
Okay. Ned, um...

47
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,936
I, uh... Ha, ha.
I'm your teacher. I'm sorry.

48
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,854
You're... You're a student.

49
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,273
And I... And I like women, ha, ha.

50
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,777
In spite of what may be written
on the backs of some of these chairs.

51
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,699
Oh, my God.

52
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,327
That guy at the counter
is totally checking you out.

53
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,496
Really?

54
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:11,291
- Oh, my God, he's really cute.
- Heh. Go for it.

55
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,961
Phoebe, I'm engaged.

56
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,797
I'm just saying, get his number,
just in case.

57
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:22,469
But if Chandler is in an accident
and can't perform sexually, you know...

58
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,724
...then he would want you to take a lover
to satisfy the needs he can no longer fulfill.

59
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,853
- Hi. I...
- Oh.

60
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,856
Can I just tell you something? Um...

61
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:38,819
I'm very flattered,
but, uh, I'm engaged. Ha, ha.

62
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,197
Wow, uh... This is kind of embarrassing.

63
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,075
I was actually coming over
to talk to your friend.

64
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,705
Well, you should be embarrassed.

65
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:58,005
- I thought you knew I was looking at you.
- I did, but that was really fun.

66
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,384
"The winner is Joey Tribbiani!"

67
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,683
"Oh, wow.

68
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,561
I honestly never expected this. I, uh...

69
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,604
I didn't prepare a speech.

70
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:19,151
But I'd like to thank my parents,
who've always been there for me.

71
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,448
Also like to thank my friends,
Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel..."

72
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,658
- I'm fourth?
- Jeez!

73
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,204
Look at you with your
little maple syrup award!

74
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,290
Maybe you don't tell anyone
about this.

75
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,666
What? No.

76
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,836
It's not a big deal.
I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.

77
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,046
- Really?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,174
- What award are you practicing for?
- Grammy.

79
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,553
- Best New Artist.
- Ooh.

80
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:50,766
Oh, hey, listen. The Soapies people called
today. I also get to present an award.

81
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,392
- Aw, that's great.
- Yeah.

82
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,853
So you'll get on stage even if you don't win.

83
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,193
- You... You don't think I'm gonna win?
- Of course I do.

84
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,486
Oh.

85
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:06,531
But, you know, Favorite Returning Character
is a tough category, Joey.

86
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,369
I mean, you're up against the guy
who survived his own cremation.

87
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:14,831
Yeah. No, I know I might not win.
But it's just...

88
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:18,001
I've never even been nominated before.
I want it so much.

89
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,711
Well, and you'll probably get it.

90
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:23,715
But you should probably start practicing
your "gracious-loser" face.

91
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,177
Like, when the cameras are on you
and you wanna look disappointed...

92
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,305
...but also that your colleague
deserved to win. Sort of like:

93
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,145
- Hey.
- You know?

94
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:41,942
- You practice losing at the Grammys too?
- Oh, no, at the Grammys, I always win.

95
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,693
Ah.

96
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,034
- Oh, hey.
- Hey. How'd your date go with Jake?

97
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,870
Great. We couldn't keep our eyes
off each other all night.

98
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:59,292
Then every once in a while, he'd lean over
and stroke my hair, and then touch my neck.

99
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,503
Okay, stop it. You're getting me all tingly.

100
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,216
All I could think of was,
"Is he gonna kiss me? Is he?"

101
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,136
- And did he?
- I'm a lady, Monica. I don't kiss and tell.

102
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,638
But this hickey speaks for itself.

103
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,849
Okay, okay, I got it. I got it.

104
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,853
I just like him so much that
I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today.

105
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,938
And I've only had six.

106
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:26,570
Oh. You know, I haven't had that feeling
since I first starting going out with Chandler.

107
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:31,283
- Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again.
- You sound like a guy.

108
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,495
Heh. No, a guy would say, "I'm never gonna
get to sleep with anyone else." Heh.

109
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,165
Oh, my God.
I'm never gonna sleep with anyone else!

110
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:43,753
I've been so busy planning the wedding,
I forgot about all the things I'd be giving up.

111
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:47,924
I mean, I'm never gonna
have a first kiss again.

112
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,302
You'll have a last kiss.

113
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:59,102
Can I ask you something? You ever
had a guy have a crush on you?

114
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,313
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?

115
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,818
There's this kid in my class
who said he's in love with me.

116
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,069
- Whoa!
- Yeah.

117
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,780
- Whoa, what?
- Ross has a boyfriend.

118
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,700
I do... I do not have a boyfriend.

119
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:17,913
There's a guy in one of my classes
who has a crush on me.

120
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,706
- Really?
- Yeah. I don't know.

121
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,584
I mean, last year, Elizabeth, now this kid...

122
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,588
What... What... What is it?
Am I giving out some kind of...

123
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,341
...a sexy-professor vibe?

124
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,970
Not right now.

125
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:39,601
The point is, my natural charisma
has made him fail his midterm.

126
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,853
Aw, see now I feel bad for the kid.

127
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,315
I had a crush on a teacher once,
and it was so hard, you know.

128
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:49,986
I couldn't concentrate and
I blushed every time he looked at me.

129
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:53,240
Come on, you remember what it's like
to be 19 and in love.

130
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,453
- Yeah, guess I can cut him some slack.
- Yeah.

131
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,665
- How'd you get over that teacher?
- I didn't.

132
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,000
I got under him.

133
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,711
Problem solved.

134
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,801
- Bye, Phoebe.
- Okay, bye.

135
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:22,060
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.

136
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,361
We said goodbye at the door
so as not to flaunt our new love.

137
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,447
Phoebe, it's okay.
You don't have to tiptoe around me.

138
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,951
I've been thinking about it, and um...
You know what?

139
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,787
I'm okay about not having
that new-relationship feeling.

140
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,749
- I miss you already!
- I miss you too!

141
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:52,591
See, that's what I mean. That's great,
but I wouldn't trade in what I have for that.

142
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,719
I mean, I'm gonna be with Chandler
for the rest of my life.

143
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,846
- That's what makes me happy.
- Mm-hm.

144
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:02,726
Hey, sweetie, come here, sit down. We
were talking about how our relationship is...

145
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,478
...deep and meaningful.
It really is, don't you think?

146
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,980
Oh, totally.

147
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,274
Pull my finger.

148
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:18,450
Presenting the award
for Favorite Returning Male...

149
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,493
This is it. This is my category!

150
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,245
- Got your speech?
- Got my speech.

151
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,039
- Got your gracious-loser face?
- Yep.

152
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,252
Now, Joey, remember,
if you win, you have to hug me.

153
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,047
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?

154
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,133
- On TV?
- Yeah.

155
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,302
- Yeah.
- Okay.

156
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:41,014

00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,223
Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives.

165
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:34,526
Any one of the brilliant actresses
nominated for this award tonight...

166
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:38,321
...deserves to take it home.
Unfortunately, only one can.

167
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,077
The nominees for
Favorite Supporting Actress are:

168
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,913
From Passions, Erin Goff.

169
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,378
From One Life to Live,
Mary Lauren Bishop.

170
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,797
From All My Children, Sarah Renee.

171
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,967
And from Days of Our Lives,
Jessica Ashley.

172
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,428
And the winner is:

173
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,264
Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives.

174
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,852
Uh, unfortunately, Jessica
couldn't be with us tonight...

175
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,814
...so I'll be accepting this award
on her behalf.

176
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,362
And I'm sure that Jessica...

177
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,614
...would like to thank my parents...

178
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,867
...who always believed in me.

179
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,369
And she'd also like to thank my friends:

180
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:30,915
Chandler, Monica, Ross,
Phoebe and Rachel...

181
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,251
...who's sitting right there.

182
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,640
Joey, why did we have to
rush out of there so fast?

183
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,851
We had to get out of there because...

184
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,187
Look what I won! Ha-ha-ha.

185
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:57,233
Oh, my God. You stole her award.

186
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:01,029
No, no, no.
I'm accepting it on her behalf.

187
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,616
I don't think you know what "behalf" means.

188
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,953
Sure I do. It's a verb. As in "I be half-in' it"!

189
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,081
Joey...

190
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:17,587
- You have got to take this back.
- Why? I should've won one. I really wanted it.

191
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:22,258
She didn't even care enough to come
to the thing. It could also be a Grammy.

192
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,138
No, Joey.

193
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:31,142
Come on, Rach. No one saw me take it.
There was a whole table full of them.

194
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,853
Do you really want an award
that you didn't win?

195
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:37,816
No, I want an award I did win.
But nobody's given me any of those!

196
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,238
Plus, look, hey, Rach. If I put it up,
when people come over, they'll see it...

197
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,989
...and they'll think I won it.

198
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,034
Joey, it says "Best Supporting Actress."

199
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,703
I can scratch that right off.

200
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,290
Joey, no, this is wrong.
You have to take it back.

201
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:59,462
Okay? You don't wanna win an award
this way. You're very talented.

202
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,509
And someday you're gonna win one of these
for real and that one is gonna mean something.

203
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,639
- Oh, all right.
- All right? Thank you.

204
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:14,185
- I'll take it back tomorrow.
- Thank you.

205
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,991
- If I can't have it, you can't have it!
- Aah!

206
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:38,501
- Professor Geller?
- Yes, Mr. Lewis? How can I help you?

207
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,754
I know I didn't do well
on my midterms and stuff...

208
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:45,466
...but I was kind of hoping
you could change my grade.

209
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,136
And why exactly would I do that?

210
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,513
Because I'm in love with you.

211
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,059
What?

212
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:59,188
Yeah. I'm all in love with you and stuff.

213
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,861
- So could you change my grade?
- No!

214
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,280
Well, why not? You changed Ned's grade.

215
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:11,618
Well, that's different, okay?
Because he was actually in love with me.

216
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:15,038
No, he's not!
He's totally yanking your chain.

217
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,665
He's done this with three other teachers.

218
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,711
- What?
- He's got a girlfriend.

219
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,549
I can't believe someone
would do that for a grade.

220
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,092
I know.

221
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,510
It's awful.

222
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,722
I love you.

223
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,811
- Have you seen Chandler?
- No, why?

224
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:42,190
I just keep thinking about
all these things I'm not gonna have...

225
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,234
...and it's freaking me out.
I don't know what to do about it.

226
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,778
Okay. Don't sweat it.

227
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:51,574
Chandler is nowhere around, so get it
out of your system. That guy's cute.

228
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,911
Phoebe, come on, I'm serious.

229
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,541
- I've just gotta talk to him about all this.
- That is the last thing you wanna do.

230
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,545
- Why?
- Because you're marrying him!

231
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,548
You gotta help me out here, Pheebs.

232
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:11,094
All right, I've never been engaged
and I've never really been married.

233
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,930
But I can only tell you
what my mother told me.

234
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:18,351
Whenever you have doubts or fears
or anxieties about a relationship...

235
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,270
...do not communicate them
to your husband.

236
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,609
So I'm not supposed to share
my doubts and fears...

237
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,278
...with the guy I'm spending
the rest of my life with?

238
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,572
That is correct. Yes.

239
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,284
You're supposed to put all that stuff
in a little box in your mind...

240
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,203
...and then lock it up tight.

241
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,956
- Your mother told you this?
- Yes.

242
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:44,085
The woman that got married a bunch of times
and killed herself when you were 13?

243
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,588
Oh, my God, you're right.

244
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,758
All right, go. Go tell Chandler.
Hurry, before it's too late!

245
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:55,596
Wait, no! Does this also mean
that putting out doesn't get you love?

246
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,480
- I can't believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
- Wait, wait.

247
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,859
Please be cool, okay?
I work with this woman.

248
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,028
- Okay, I'm totally cool.
- Okay.

249
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,530
Come in.

250
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,782
Hey, Jessica.

251
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,868
Hey, Jess.

252
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,619
This is my friend Rachel.

253
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,372
- Hi.
- What's up?

254
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,378
Uh, listen, here's your Soapie.
I accepted it for you.

255
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,549
Oh, my God. I won?
Do you have any idea what this means?

256
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,139
That's it. You're not gonna put it
on your shelf or anything?

257
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:43,227
No, I try to save that for real awards.
Now if you'll excuse me?

258
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,730
Hm!

259
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,106
- Take it back?
- Absolutely.

260
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,608
Yep.

261
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,114
Yeah, you do.

262
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,495
- Honey? As we get closer to the wedding...
- Hm?

263
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,247
...is there anything you'd like to
talk about or share?

264
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,418
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces
are too big.

265
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,837
You're wrong. The centerpieces are fine.

266
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,094
- Do you ever get scared at all?
- Kind of. They're really big.

267
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:23,226
Doesn't it ever freak you out that you're
never gonna be with anybody new again?

268
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,061
What?

269
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,604
Just...

270
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,398
I love you so much. Just...

271
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:33,277
It's just sometimes it bothers me
that I'm never gonna have that feeling.

272
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,738
When you first meet someone
for the first time...

273
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,450
...and it's new and exciting.
You know that rush?

274
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,536
No.

275
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,247
No, see, when I first meet somebody...

276
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:49,669
...it's mostly panic, anxiety
and a great deal of sweating.

277
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,256
Okay, but... All right, you're a guy.

278
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:57,426
Does it not freak you out that you're
never gonna sleep with anybody else?

279
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,138
Sleeping with somebody, no.

280
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:04,433
Anxiety, panic and
I'm afraid even more sweating.

281
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:06,978
Even with me?

282
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:11,399
I was dangerously dehydrated during
the first six months of our relationship.

283
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:18,322
Look, for me the rush is knowing that we
are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.

284
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,742
- Really?
- Well, yeah.

285
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:27,248
Knowing you're having these thoughts,
we're back to panic, anxiety and, uh...

286
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,293
...I'm definitely gonna need
some kind of sports drink.

287
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,461
Come here.

288
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:36,215
Come here.
Oh, sweetie, you don't have to worry.

289
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:41,137
No. Besides, you know what?
I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you.

290
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:45,850
The first time we buy a house,
our first kid, our first grandkid.

291
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,477
Water. Water. Water.

292
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,441
Uh, Mr. Morse?
Can I speak to you for a moment?

293
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,363
That was a great lecture today.

294
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,823
- Did you get a haircut?
- Mm-hm.

295
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,619
Yeah, yeah. Do you like it?
Do you love it?

296
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,040
I want you to know that
I'm changing your grade back.

297
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,667
What? Why?

298
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,588
Because I know what you're trying
to pull here. It's not gonna work.

299
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:20,426
I'm not trying to pull anything.
Look, I love you, dude.

300
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,431
You know what, I'm not even gonna talk
about this. This little "thing" is over.

301
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,561
I know you have a girlfriend. Yeah.
And I know about the other professors.

302
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,357
How do you think that makes me feel, Ned?
You used me!

303
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,817
You don't love me and you never did!

304
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,740
Ah, Professor Winston.
Professor Frederickson.

305
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,286
I'll be right with you.

306
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,498
Don't make this worse
and I'll give you a C. Shall we?

307
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,089
Rach?

308
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,509
- I'll be out in a second.
- Hm.

309
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,890
"It's just so unexpected! I...

310
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,725
Ha-ha-ha.

311
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,730
I'll tell you, it's just such an honor
to just be nominated...

312
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,817
...for a Nobel Prize.

313
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:23,572
And, you know, to win one
for a massage! Oh...

314
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,660
Especially after having just won
a Tony Award for Best Actress..."

315
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,745
We have to go.
Our reservations are at 8.

316
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:33,499
"...in Reservations at Eight
by Neil Simon.

317
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,545
Thank you, Neil.
Thank you for the words."

318
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,840
You can finish this later.
We're gonna be late. We gotta go.

319
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,342
Please don't play the music.
Just one more thing.

320
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,552
Okay.

321
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,681
"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!"
