1
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:05,587
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,132
I found a note on my door,
"Come to Monica's.

3
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:11,427
Bring champagne
and a Three Musketeers bar"?

4
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,178
Yeah, I'll take that.

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,014
What's up?

6
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:18,726
- Monica and I are engaged.
- Oh, my God.

7
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,774
Congratulations. Where is she?

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,777
I'm engaged! I'm engaged!

9
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,906
She's been there for 20 minutes.
You didn't hear?

10
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,951
I thought it was a kid yelling, "I'm gay!"

11
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:41,081
- Can I bring her in?
- Let her stay. It's sweet.

12
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,668
I'm getting married! I'm gonna be a bride!

13
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,462
Shut up.

14
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:50,090
No, I will not shut up, because I'm engaged!

15
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,471
Oh, big talk! Why don't you
come here and say that to me?

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,390
My fiancé will kick your ass.

17
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:03,020
Come on, apartment 20, apartment 20.

18
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,900
You get her in, you bolt the door,
I'll be in the closet.

19
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,776
Okay, wait, wait, wait. Okay, shh.

20
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,820
Okay. Um.

21
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:57,574
I just want to say that I love
you guys so, so much...

22
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,369
...and thank you for being here
on my special night.

23
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,372
Our special night.

24
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,376
It just wouldn't be my night... Our night...

25
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:11,463
...if you weren't here to celebrate
with me... Us. Damn it!

26
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:15,092
It's okay, I want this to be your night too.

27
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,010
To Monica.

28
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,054
Come on, wait, stop it.

29
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,516
- Okay, to Monica.
- To Monica.

30
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:27,688
Have you decided on a band for the
wedding, because I'm kind of musical.

31
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:32,151
She got engaged a few hours ago,
I doubt she's had time to think...

32
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,571
Speaking of chiming in,
remember burning my apartment?

33
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,283
Yeah, you're on your own.

34
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:43,495
We should get dressed up
and go have champagne at the Plaza.

35
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,289
- Oh, okay!
- Yeah.

36
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,124
I can't stay too long.

37
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,794
I gotta get up early for an audition.
I gotta look good.

38
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,881
I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.

39
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,884
What?

40
00:02:57,093 --> 00:03:00,554
So when you said get up early,
did you mean 1986?

41
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,308
You guys don't think I look 19?

42
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,771
Oh, 19! We thought you said 90.

43
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,190
Oh.

44
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,944
- Okay, everybody, let's go.
- Okay.

45
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,325
Is my candy bar around here?

46
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,910
No, you ate it all.

47
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,454
I was afraid of that.

48
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:36,048
You know what shoes would look great
with this ring?

49
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,966
Diamond shoes.

50
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,346
You're not getting dressed.

51
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,353
Know what I mean?

52
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,649
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.

53
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,525
There's gonna be a wedding.

54
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,319
You're gonna be the bride.

55
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:01,740
Two hundred people are gonna be
looking at you in a clean, white dress.

56
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,159
Let's do it.

57
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,587
Chandler, it happens to lots of guys.

58
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,716
You're tired, you had a lot of champagne.

59
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,219
Don't worry about it.

60
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:27,766
I'm not worried. I'm fascinated.

61
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,686
You know? It's like biology.

62
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:34,439
Which is funny, because in high school
I failed biology...

63
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,484
...and tonight biology failed me.

64
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,657
Check it out. I could play this
while the guests are coming in, okay.

65
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:49,538
First time I met Chandler
I thought he was gay

66
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:57,254
But here I am singing
On his wedding day

67
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,548
Phoebe, no.

68
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:04,219
If you'd let me finish, it goes on
to say that he's probably not gay.

69
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:11,018
You guys don't have this problem,
you're made of wood.

70
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,273
- Hey, you look great.
- Hey.

71
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,191
Oh, thanks.

72
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,943
You okay over there?

73
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,948
I don't know. You know? I feel a little...

74
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,703
You know what? Never mind. I'll be fine.

75
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:35,083
Don't worry about it. You're probably tired,
you had a lot of champagne.

76
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,544
It happens to everybody.

77
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,632
- Hey. Wow.
- Hi.

78
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,886
- Happy Monica's Night.
- Well, thank you. You too.

79
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,306
Can you believe
they are actually getting married?

80
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,601
Well, sure, but I get married all the time.

81
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,774
- You okay?
- Yeah, I guess.

82
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:03,070
Do you think we'll ever have that?

83
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,031
You mean "we," you and me?

84
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,617
Oh, no, no, no.

85
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,119
"We," you with someone, me with someone.

86
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,996
Good, you scared me a minute.

87
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,374
I know. Shake it off.

88
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,544
It's just because you and I,
we were like a nightmare.

89
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:27,177
- No, but there were some good times.
- Absolutely. Like there was...

90
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:33,183
- Surely you can think of something.
- Just give me a minute.

91
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,978
Oh, well, yes.

92
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,733
- I can think of one good thing.
- What?

93
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,406
You were always good at the...

94
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,660
...at the, uh, the stuff.

95
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,831
Yeah, I...

96
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,375
I was good at the stuff?

97
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,960
Mm-hm. Yup.

98
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,003
I really liked your hands.

99
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,880
- My hands?
- Yeah.

100
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,800
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

101
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,635
Way to go, guys.

102
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,056
You were really good at the stuff too.

103
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,724
Oh, I know.

104
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,980
Hey, you know what we never did?

105
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,357
Oh, no, not that.

106
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,735
We never had bonus night.

107
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,446
- A what?
- You know, bonus night.

108
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:31,491
Two people break up,
but they get back together for one night.

109
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:36,455
One night, just sex?
No strings attached?

110
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,665
Yeah, yeah, we never had that.

111
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,750
- No.
- No.

112
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:49,092
Okay, this is getting a little crazy.

113
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,012
Um, I mean...

114
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,347
...I'm sure it would be amazing...

115
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,809
...but I really don't think
it would be a good idea.

116
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,895
I really...

117
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,481
...really...

118
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,483
...don't.

119
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,334
What's up?

120
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,255
What's up, dude?

121
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,550
Take whatever you want,
just don't hurt me.

122
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,639
You playing a little PlayStation, huh?

123
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,849
That's wack.

124
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,979
PlayStation is wack.

125
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,567
What's up with the wack PlayStation,
what's up?

126
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,028
Huh?

127
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,948
Come on, am I 19 or what?

128
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:57,619
Yes, on a scale of one to 10,
10 being the dumbest a person can look...

129
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,829
...you are definitely 19.

130
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,874
Come on, really. How old?

131
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,669
Young. You're a man-child, okay?

132
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:11,007
Now get changed, everybody's ready.
And please, please, keep my underwear.

133
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,177
- Oh, thanks.
- Okay.

134
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,392
- Joe.
- Yeah.

135
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,643
Uh.

136
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,439
You've had a lot of sex, right?

137
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,528
When, today?

138
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,199
Some, not a lot.

139
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,705
The reason I'm asking
is because I had kind of a, uh...

140
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,873
I was unable to...

141
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,043
I really wanted to, but I couldn't...

142
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,920
There, ha, hm.

143
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,298
There was an incident.

144
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,844
Don't worry about that, man. That happens.

145
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,598
- It's happened to you?
- Yeah, once.

146
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,893
- Well, what'd you do?
- I did it anyway.

147
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,400
Phoebe, come on, let's go.

148
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,694
Come on.

149
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,864
Why aren't you dressed yet?

150
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,617
I wrote the best song for your wedding.

151
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,160
- Check this out.
- Phoeb.

152
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,704
If you get ready now, you can play.

153
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:23,997
- Really?!
- Yes.

154
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,708
That's so exciting! Thanks, Mon.

155
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,546
But if you touch my guitar again,
I'll have to pound on you a little bit.

156
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,716
Fair enough. Get ready. I'll get everybody.

157
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,885
Finally we can start celebrating my...

158
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,851
I'm sorry, apparently I opened
the door to the past.

159
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,818
Okay, Monica, Mon.
Okay, what you just saw...

160
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,781
Can I ask you just a little question?
Why tonight?

161
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,785
- What?
- I waited my whole life to be engaged.

162
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:05,121
And unlike some,
I only plan on doing this once.

163
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:12,253
Maybe it's selfish, I'm sorry, but I hoped
tonight could just be about that.

164
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,255
- Oh, honey, but it is.
- No, it's not.

165
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,883
Now it's about you getting back together.

166
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,761
See, you kind of stole my thunder.

167
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,599
We did not steal your thunder.
We are not getting back together.

168
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,103
- Yeah, no, and nobody even saw.
- Yeah.

169
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,106
That's true.

170
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,025
- We just kissed.
- It was just a kiss.

171
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,527
You guys kissed?

172
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,406
What does this mean?

173
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,575
Are you back together?
Can I sing at your wedding?

174
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,829
Thunder being stolen.

175
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,624
- Phoebe, it's nothing.
- Let's not make a big deal of this.

176
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,794
It was a one-time thing.
It doesn't even matter.

177
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,379
Oh, my God.

178
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,217
I cannot believe you guys
are talking about this.

179
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,303
Problems in the bedroom
are between a man and woman.

180
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,892
All right? Now, Chandler
is doing the best he can.

181
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:14,149
I don't think that's
what they were talking about.

182
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:18,111
What a great night.
Chandler can't do it, they kissed.

183
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,739
- What?
- You guys kissed? This is huge.

184
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,031
No, it's not huge.

185
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,160
People thinking it's huge
has led Monica to believe...

186
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,620
...we're stealing her thunder,
which we aren't.

187
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,748
We're still talking about it.

188
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,834
That, and Chandler's problem.

189
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,670
Monica, listen, listen.

190
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,549
Would you feel better if we stopped
talking about Ross and Rachel?

191
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,634
- That would be lovely.
- You got it.

192
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,846
Now, I can pass for 19, right?

193
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,015
Yes, you can pass for 19.

194
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,725
- Really?
- Yes.

195
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,977
- Seriously?
- Seriously?

196
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:56,191
Seriously, no. Okay? You can play
your own age, which is 31.

197
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,987
I'm 30!

198
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,616
Joey, you are not. You're 31.

199
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,535
Oh, crap!

200
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:12,957
So, the Plaza. We'll get some mai tais?
Maybe no more for you though.

201
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:19,255
You know, I think I don't feel like
going to the Plaza.

202
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,216
- Why?
- This is ridiculous.

203
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:25,929
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't. Especially with you.

204
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,141
Pssh. That is wack.

205
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,153
Yeah?

206
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,240
I'll play it at the wedding.

207
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,868
Yeah, well, we'll see if they
actually let you play, huh?

208
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,454
They tell you anything you want to hear...

209
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,373
...like, "You look 19."

210
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:57,502
Then they just take it away,
like, "No, you don't."

211
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,713
Monica won't take this away.

212
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,675
- Wouldn't she?
- Would she?

213
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,052
Would she?

214
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,808
You ate my candy bar!

215
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,481
Guess who.

216
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,358
Hey.

217
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,696
Hey, I just realized we kind of left
some stuff up in the air.

218
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,364
What did Monica mean:

219
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,741
"I don't want to talk,"
especially with me?

220
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,953
Why not especially you and me?
We were both kissing.

221
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,413
Still thinking about it?

222
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:37,125
I'm serious. What did she mean by that?
"Especially you."

223
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,294
- Oh, who cares?
- I care.

224
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,588
And so do I.

225
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,218
I have to talk to her.
Will you let me get changed?

226
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,512
Okay, sure.

227
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,558
Am I going to let you watch me?

228
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:54,893
No.

229
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,314
I can't believe her. It's just so typical.

230
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:03,860
I know you're upset, but don't forget
there is going to be a wedding.

231
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:08,156
You are going to throw the bouquet,
and then a honeymoon.

232
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,826
- Maybe in Paris.
- Paris?

233
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:16,664
We will take a moonlit walk
on the Rue de la blah-blah-blah.

234
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,002
Keep talking.

235
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:24,339
We will sprinkle rose petals
on the bed and make love...

236
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:29,135
...not just because it's romantic,
but because I can.

237
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,971
I love you.

238
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,723
Mmm.

239
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,521
Bonjour, monsieur.

240
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,860
Don't say anything,
you might scare it away.

241
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,573
It's Paris. Who knows we're here?

242
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,870
Hi, Pheebs. What's up?

243
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,540
You said I could sing at your wedding,
so I need a small deposit.

244
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,379
- What?
- Good-faith money to hold the date.

245
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,798
We're not giving you a deposit
for our wedding.

246
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,759
Oh, I see.

247
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,721
They break your heart, don't they?

248
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,850
You know, I don't really need
their permission.

249
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,104
You want to sing at their wedding,
sing at their wedding.

250
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,107
Yeah, and if you want to look 19, then you...

251
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,943
You got to do something about your eyes.

252
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,945
What's wrong with my eyes?

253
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,490
They give you away.
There's too much wisdom in there.

254
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,080
Put some tea bags on them for 15 minutes.

255
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:42,709
- That'll get rid of my wisdom?
- Maybe 10 minutes for you.

256
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:49,215
Give her the deposit,
give her the ring. I don't care.

257
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,555
- Yes?
- What did you mean when you said...

258
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,599
...you didn't want to talk to anyone,
especially me?

259
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:03,396
What a great apology.
And you accept it. Bye-bye.

260
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:08,234
No, seriously, what was
the "especially me" part about?

261
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,112
Let's just say it's not the first time
you've stolen my thunder.

262
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,447
Wha?

263
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,741
Hey, here's a thought...

264
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,036
Monica, what are you talking about?

265
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,414
My sweet 16. You went to third base
with my cousin Charlie.

266
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,875
Ah, third base.

267
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,128
It was all everybody could talk about.

268
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:31,340
The only reason I did that
was because your party was so boring.

269
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,094
- We had a caricaturist.
- Oh.

270
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,600
Whenever I get married
Guess who won't be asked to sing

271
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:45,271
Somebody named Geller
And somebody else named Bing

272
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,653
Monica, your sweet 16
was like a million years ago.

273
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,614
Yet here you are doing it again.

274
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,158
Oh, I don't want to steal your stupid thunder.

275
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,244
Why else would you have
made out with Ross?

276
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,538
Got me.

277
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,585
Easy, mimey, the moment has passed.
It ain't gonna happen.

278
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,422
It'd be nice if I could have this night.

279
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,841
I never wanted any part of your night.

280
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,635
No one was supposed to see us.

281
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,555
Is that why you did it in the secret hallway,
where nobody ever goes?

282
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,975
Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking.

283
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:27,522
I don't think us getting together
tonight is such a good idea.

284
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,899
I'm calling it off.

285
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,153
Way to save your dignity, my man.

286
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:39,659
Mon, why, why would I ever want
to take away from your night?

287
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,453
I don't know, maybe you feel
a little resentful.

288
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,414
Maybe you thought you'd get married first.

289
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,874
Maybe you can't stand...

290
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:50,211
...that your formerly fat friend
is getting married first.

291
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,757
Oh, wow, that... You know what?
That is so unfair.

292
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,593
Now I want to steal your thunder.

293
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,263
Come on, Ross. Let's go have sex!

294
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,067
I can't believe you're gonna have sex
on my engagement night.

295
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,986
Well, somebody should.

296
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,074
Look, if we're gonna do this...

297
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,869
We're not. She's just gonna think we are.

298
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,288
I see, so everybody wins.

299
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,792
- Who is it?
- It's Monica, open up.

300
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,629
Okay, Ross, stop it. Please, wait a minute.

301
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,757
Ow!

302
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,135
Yeah, you like that, baby?

303
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,056
May we help you?

304
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:49,187
I wanted to say I hope you have sex,
and I hope you get back together.

305
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,481
I warn you, the night
you announce your engagement...

306
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,443
...I'm going to announce
that I'm pregnant.

307
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,696
How is that ever going to happen?

308
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,741
Do you want to know why
I was with Ross tonight?

309
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,284
- I know why.
- You don't.

310
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:06,662
- Okay, why?
- Because I was sad.

311
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,331
What do you mean?

312
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,667
Look, I am so...

313
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,213
...so happy for you guys.

314
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:19,217
But you getting married reminds me
of the fact that I'm not.

315
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,927
I'm not even close.

316
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,263
Maybe I just wanted
to make myself feel better.

317
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,558
I know that that's dumb,
but you were so depressed...

318
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,269
...when Ross got married,
you slept with Chandler.

319
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,233
I don't care, she slept with me.

320
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:40,696
Anyway, sweetie,
I am so sorry I ruined your night.

321
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,576
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.

322
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,917
I'm gonna take off.

323
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,463
- Congratulations, man.
- Thanks.

324
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,715
- And Rachel.
- Yeah.

325
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,008
What can I say?

326
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,010
You missed your chance.

327
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:08,391
From now on, the only person who's
going to enjoy these bad boys is me.

328
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,861
We thought Phoebe would leave

329
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,906
But she just stayed and stayed

330
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,409
That's right, I'm here all night

331
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,202
And Chandler will never get...

332
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,997
Hey, here's a dollar.

333
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,041
Consider it a deposit.
Please sing at our wedding.

334
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,377
- Oh, thank you.
- Okay.

335
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,381
Now who will perform the ceremony?

336
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,133
Who will perform the cer...?

337
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,634
Oh, oh.

338
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,597
I'll pound on him in the morning.
