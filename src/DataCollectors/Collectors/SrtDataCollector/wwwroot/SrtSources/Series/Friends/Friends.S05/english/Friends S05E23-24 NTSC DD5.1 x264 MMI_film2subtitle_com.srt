1
00:00:05,183 --> 00:00:07,344
-Pheebs, could you get that, please?
-Why?

2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:10,818
Just because you're too lazy
to get up off your tushy?

3
00:00:11,423 --> 00:00:16,486
No, it's just that all the people in the world
l would want to talk to are right here.

4
00:00:20,032 --> 00:00:21,932
Sucker.

5
00:00:22,634 --> 00:00:23,760
Hello?

6
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:25,903
-Hey, Joey!
-<i>Hey, Pheebs.</i>

7
00:00:26,138 --> 00:00:27,366
l need a favor.

8
00:00:27,573 --> 00:00:30,940
l forgot the PlN to my ATM card.
Can you get it for me?

9
00:00:31,143 --> 00:00:32,405
<i>Sure. Where is it?</i>

10
00:00:32,644 --> 00:00:35,477
l scratched it on the ATM machine
on the corner.

11
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:38,406
So you're 5-6-3-9?

12
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,277
That's it! Thanks.

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,311
-Wanna talk to Chandler?
-Let me talk to him.

14
00:00:44,556 --> 00:00:46,319
<i>He didn't believe in my movie...</i>

15
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,756
...which is a big mistake,
because it is real. Real.

16
00:00:51,663 --> 00:00:54,632
Tribbiani, get back to work.
Break time's over.

17
00:00:56,635 --> 00:00:59,126
-Who was that?
-My stunt double. Yeah.

18
00:00:59,304 --> 00:01:01,704
He's getting a little too familiar
for my tastes.

19
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,937
l've tried to apologize.

20
00:01:05,143 --> 00:01:08,704
lf l can't do it on the phone,
l'll go and do it in person.

21
00:01:08,947 --> 00:01:10,881
l heard that. Can you put him on?

22
00:01:14,653 --> 00:01:15,642
Don't come out here.

23
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:21,190
l support you 1 00% and l wanna prove
that to you in person.

24
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,657
l got that. l forgive you.
Don't come out here.

25
00:01:24,863 --> 00:01:27,024
You haven't taken
my calls for a week.

26
00:01:27,232 --> 00:01:31,066
l'm totally over it. Friends forever.
Don't come out here.

27
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:34,735
Would you mind doing
a picture with us?

28
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:38,640
-What was that?
-<i>Entertainment Tonight.</i>

29
00:01:40,812 --> 00:01:43,747
Good talking to you
and don't come out here.

30
00:01:47,152 --> 00:01:49,518
The One in Vegas

31
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,568
Monica? l'm sorry l'm late.

32
00:02:46,645 --> 00:02:49,113
l'm so sorry.
Have you been here long?

33
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:50,942
That's okay.

34
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,346
What the hell took you so long?

35
00:02:55,987 --> 00:02:58,649
You can't tell Chandler.
l ran into Richard.

36
00:02:58,857 --> 00:03:00,324
-Which Richard?
-The Richard.

37
00:03:00,525 --> 00:03:02,686
Richard Simmons? Oh, my God!

38
00:03:04,029 --> 00:03:08,295
No, my ex-boyfriend Richard.
You know, the tall guy, mustache.

39
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,867
Okay, that actually
makes more sense. How was it?

40
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,870
lt was really nice. We talked
and l had lunch with him.

41
00:03:16,074 --> 00:03:19,202
That's weird. l dreamed
you had lunch with Richard.

42
00:03:19,411 --> 00:03:21,345
-Really?
-Again, Richard Simmons.

43
00:03:22,147 --> 00:03:23,136
Go on.

44
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:25,872
The strange part was
he was really nice...

45
00:03:26,084 --> 00:03:28,985
...and he looks great,
but l didn't feel anything.

46
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:31,052
So why can't we tell Chandler?

47
00:03:31,256 --> 00:03:35,818
lt'll freak him out and tomorrow's our
anniversary. l don't wanna spoil it.

48
00:03:36,027 --> 00:03:39,087
l can't believe you guys
have lasted a whole year!

49
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:41,595
Wow, l owe Rachel 20 bucks.

50
00:03:43,902 --> 00:03:45,733
On a totally different bet.

51
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:52,241
-lt's almost our anniversary!
-l know.

52
00:03:52,444 --> 00:03:56,073
One year ago today, l was just
your annoying friend Chandler.

53
00:03:56,548 --> 00:03:59,244
Now you're just
my annoying friend Chandler.

54
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:01,875
l got you a gift.

55
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:05,887
-lt's not till tomorrow.
-l know, but you have to open it today.

56
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,731
Okay! There you go!

57
00:04:20,972 --> 00:04:23,031
lt's two tickets to Vegas!

58
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:26,778
Yeah! For this weekend!
lt'll be perfect.

59
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:31,108
You'll see Joey, plus, we'll start
our celebration on the plane.

60
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:34,443
We can call it our ''Plane-aversary.''

61
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,517
Do we have to?

62
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:41,990
This is great, but Joey didn't want
any of us there.

63
00:04:42,227 --> 00:04:46,891
He doesn't want us to go to any trouble.
He'll be excited when we surprise him.

64
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:50,965
Plus, we get to have
our own ''Anna-Vegas-ry'' !

65
00:04:53,004 --> 00:04:55,598
''Anna-vada-versary!''

66
00:04:56,474 --> 00:04:59,068
l think we should see other people.

67
00:04:59,277 --> 00:05:00,642
We can go, right?

68
00:05:00,946 --> 00:05:02,106
Great idea.

69
00:05:02,314 --> 00:05:03,611
l'm gonna go too!

70
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:08,912
Pheebs, it's kind of
our anniversary.

71
00:05:09,154 --> 00:05:11,850
You won't ditch me
like you did with London.

72
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,853
Ditch you?
You were pregnant--

73
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:15,650
Great story. l'm going.

74
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:24,963
Listen, this weekend we're all gonna go
to Las Vegas to surprise Joey!

75
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:28,462
lncluding me!

76
00:05:29,174 --> 00:05:30,163
Do you wanna go?

77
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,309
l can take a couple days off work.

78
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,947
Of course you can take a couple days
off, because this trip includes me!

79
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:41,581
l've got a presentation tomorrow.
l can't miss that.

80
00:05:41,786 --> 00:05:45,779
l've got tickets to the Van Gogh
exhibit. l waited a year for this.

81
00:05:46,524 --> 00:05:48,549
Art lover.

82
00:05:52,964 --> 00:05:54,591
What'd you say?

83
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:57,166
l said, art lover.

84
00:05:57,335 --> 00:06:01,294
-Was that supposed to be an insult?
-l don't know, l'm very tired.

85
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,939
-Rach, maybe we can fly out Saturday?
-Sounds great.

86
00:06:05,176 --> 00:06:06,609
l'll call the airlines.

87
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:10,480
That'll be nice to have
the apartment to myself.

88
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:12,640
To walk around naked.

89
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,578
No, so l can be by myself.
Have a little alone time.

90
00:06:19,157 --> 00:06:20,454
Naked alone time.

91
00:06:21,326 --> 00:06:24,921
Just because l'm alone doesn't mean
l wanna walk around naked.

92
00:06:25,196 --> 00:06:27,528
You live alone,
you don't walk around naked.

93
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:30,667
Why does it takes me so long
to answer the door?

94
00:06:39,077 --> 00:06:43,741
So far, is this trip to Las Vegas
better or worse than the trip to London?

95
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:46,643
So far, it's pretty much
the same, Pheebs.

96
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:50,582
What about after l give you
these candies?

97
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:54,323
l guess it's a little better now.

98
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,552
Las Vegas, 1 .
London, 0.

99
00:06:59,364 --> 00:07:01,059
l'll be back.

100
00:07:04,002 --> 00:07:05,560
Happy Plane-aversary.

101
00:07:07,238 --> 00:07:08,762
l love you.

102
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,907
-Can l give you your present now?
-Okay!

103
00:07:16,448 --> 00:07:18,439
Oh, don't tell me l did this.

104
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:22,084
l love ''l forgot the present'' fake-out!

105
00:07:22,787 --> 00:07:26,518
How about ''l did forget the present,
forgive me'' not fake-out?

106
00:07:27,092 --> 00:07:29,526
You can give it to me
when we get back.

107
00:07:29,761 --> 00:07:32,127
This is the worst thing
that could happen.

108
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:35,265
You decided to tell him
about the Richard thing.

109
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:40,802
What ''Richard thing''?

110
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,904
Oh, no.

111
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:45,733
What ''Richard thing''?

112
00:07:45,944 --> 00:07:47,775
Simmons. Go with Simmons.

113
00:07:54,953 --> 00:07:56,887
l ran into Richard yesterday.

114
00:07:57,088 --> 00:08:00,785
He asked me if l wanted to go
for a bite and l did.

115
00:08:00,992 --> 00:08:03,586
l didn't tell you
because you'd get mad...

116
00:08:03,795 --> 00:08:06,286
...and l didn't wanna spoil
our anniversary.

117
00:08:06,898 --> 00:08:08,388
l'm not mad.

118
00:08:10,635 --> 00:08:12,500
Really?

119
00:08:12,804 --> 00:08:15,898
So you bumped into Richard.
You grabbed a ''bite.''

120
00:08:18,476 --> 00:08:20,103
No big deal.

121
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:24,580
Great.

122
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:30,687
Okay, London, 1 .

123
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:34,522
This is gonna be a real horserace.

124
00:09:08,893 --> 00:09:10,485
Oh, look what happened.

125
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:14,728
<i>Check me out.</i>

126
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:17,331
<i>I'm in my kitchen...</i>

127
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:19,025
<i>...naked.</i>

128
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,396
<i>I'm picking up an orange.</i>

129
00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:24,033
<i>I'm naked.</i>

130
00:09:26,711 --> 00:09:29,236
<i>I'm lighting the candles.</i>

131
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:32,245
<i>Naked. And carefully.</i>

132
00:09:43,228 --> 00:09:46,129
<i>Oh, my God! That's Rachel, naked!</i>

133
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:50,926
<i>I can't look at that.</i>
<i>I am looking at this.</i>

134
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:55,095
<i>Okay, vivid colors,</i>
<i>expressive brush strokes.</i>

135
00:09:56,241 --> 00:10:00,109
<i>Unless she wants me</i>
<i>to be looking at that.</i>

136
00:10:00,812 --> 00:10:02,541
<i>She knows I'm home.</i>

137
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,647
<i>She knows I can see her.</i>

138
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:09,478
<i>What kind of game is she playing?</i>

139
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:13,713
<i>I think maybe someone's lonely tonight.</i>

140
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:16,157
<i>Dr. Geller.</i>

141
00:10:16,427 --> 00:10:19,487
<i>Stop it. You're being silly.</i>

142
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:23,097
<i>Or am I?</i>

143
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:28,169
<i>Love to love you baby</i>

144
00:10:30,341 --> 00:10:32,241
<i>Love to love you baby</i>

145
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:42,651
<i>Love to love you baby</i>

146
00:10:43,922 --> 00:10:45,150
Darn it!

147
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,332
May l come in?

148
00:11:01,873 --> 00:11:03,033
Yeah, if you want to.

149
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:05,976
Do you want me to?

150
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:08,905
Yeah, sure?

151
00:11:09,147 --> 00:11:10,978
So do l.

152
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:19,045
Okay, Rach, before anything happens...

153
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:22,020
...l wanna lay down a couple
of ground rules.

154
00:11:22,227 --> 00:11:24,923
This is just about tonight.

155
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:29,326
l won't go through with this
if it'll raise the question of ''us.''

156
00:11:31,436 --> 00:11:32,903
l just want this to be...

157
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:37,998
...about what it is.

158
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,372
And...

159
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:45,410
...what is that, Ross?

160
00:11:45,683 --> 00:11:48,243
The physical act of love.

161
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:51,219
What, are you crazy?

162
00:11:51,422 --> 00:11:56,257
So you weren't trying to entice me
just now with your nakedness?

163
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,630
Oh, God. You saw me?

164
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,534
You weren't trying to entice me
with your nakedness?

165
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:15,138
You actually thought
l wanted to have sex with you?

166
00:12:30,928 --> 00:12:35,991
Oh, wow. l'm sorry. But, Ross,
you kicked off your shoes.

167
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:40,900
-Can we just forget this ever happened?
-Of course. You're right. l'm sorry.

168
00:12:41,072 --> 00:12:42,699
-Thank you.
-Yes.

169
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:46,037
-l guess l'm gonna go pack.
-Okay. Wait, one more thing.

170
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:50,374
Do we still need to settle
the question of ''us''?

171
00:13:14,072 --> 00:13:16,666
Hey, you guys, wait!
You guys.

172
00:13:16,941 --> 00:13:19,171
This place is much better than London.

173
00:13:19,444 --> 00:13:22,072
A lady dressed like Cleopatra
gave me this.

174
00:13:22,347 --> 00:13:24,815
Ninety-nine cent
steak and lobster dinner.

175
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,448
You don't eat animals.

176
00:13:26,684 --> 00:13:28,982
For ninety-nine cents l'd eat you.

177
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:32,582
l can totally settle down here.

178
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,988
lt's got everything l could ever want.
lncluding Joey! Look!

179
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:39,256
Look! Hey!

180
00:13:39,664 --> 00:13:40,756
Oh, my God.

181
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:49,829
Love your condoms, my man.

182
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:53,675
Why are you here?
l told you not to come.

183
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:55,902
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?

184
00:13:56,647 --> 00:14:00,674
Because l'm shooting a scene right now.
l play a gladiator.

185
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,820
Hold on a second. Can we cut?

186
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:07,523
My friends are here.
l'm gonna take a break.

187
00:14:07,992 --> 00:14:09,687
Who are you talking to?

188
00:14:10,995 --> 00:14:12,519
The director.

189
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:13,958
Her.

190
00:14:17,168 --> 00:14:20,194
All right, it's not a gladiator movie.
l work here.

191
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:21,938
Why? What happened?

192
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,165
The movie shut down.
Ran out of money.

193
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:27,707
l'm working here till it starts up,
if it ever does.

194
00:14:27,945 --> 00:14:29,640
-l'm so sorry.
-Such a drag.

195
00:14:29,881 --> 00:14:32,111
Sorry l didn't tell you.
l'm sorry.

196
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,478
Apparently there's
a new policy of not sharing.

197
00:14:35,686 --> 00:14:39,178
-l knew you weren't okay with that.
-So you're a gladiator!

198
00:14:40,124 --> 00:14:41,557
What's going on?

199
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:44,659
-Monica had lunch with Richard.
-Dawson?

200
00:14:47,298 --> 00:14:49,732
But that would've been so cool!

201
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:51,566
Her boyfriend Richard.

202
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:56,069
lt meant nothing. After all this time,
how can you not trust me?

203
00:14:56,307 --> 00:14:59,743
When you go lunching with hunky men
and don't tell me!

204
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:04,814
You're right. l'm sorry.
l should've told you.

205
00:15:05,383 --> 00:15:06,372
Thanks.

206
00:15:07,318 --> 00:15:10,082
-There we go.
-Now l love Vegas.

207
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:14,215
l promise you next time
l absolutely will tell you.

208
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:20,693
-''Next time''?
-So close.

209
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,727
There won't be a next time.
You cannot see him again.

210
00:15:24,936 --> 00:15:28,599
l cannot see him?
You can't tell me what to do.

211
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,774
That's funny, l think l just did.

212
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:34,538
lf you act like this,
l won't be around you.

213
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:36,404
-Fine.
-Happy anniversary!

214
00:15:36,647 --> 00:15:39,115
Guys, please! Come on, come on.

215
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:41,410
This is obviously
a misunderstanding.

216
00:15:41,652 --> 00:15:42,710
No, it is not.

217
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,218
Don't look at me.
l just work here.

218
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:56,459
Okay, Ross? l'm a little warm,
so l'm gonna be taking off my sweater.

219
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:59,261
Now, l'm just letting you know...

220
00:15:59,504 --> 00:16:03,600
...this is not an invitation
to the physical act of love.

221
00:16:05,476 --> 00:16:07,569
Yep, that's hilarious.

222
00:16:08,412 --> 00:16:10,403
l'm sorry. l'm done. l'm done.

223
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:13,741
You know, last night was
embarrassing for you too.

224
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:17,911
No, not really. You've seen me naked
hundreds of times.

225
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:21,081
But it was a first for the rest
of my building.

226
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:25,723
That's true. But l just don't embarrass
that easily.

227
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:28,058
What? You totally get embarrassed.

228
00:16:28,232 --> 00:16:32,760
No, l don't. Ross, l think l'm just
a more secure person than you are.

229
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,631
-ls that so?
-Yeah.

230
00:16:36,507 --> 00:16:37,633
Hey, lady!

231
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:40,275
l don't care how much
you want it, okay?

232
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:43,479
l am not gonna have sex
with you in the bathroom!

233
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:52,119
You know, in Roman times,
this was more than just a hat.

234
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,422
-Really?
-Yeah, sure, sure.

235
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,651
They would scrub the floors.

236
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:00,454
They'd use it to get the mud
off their shoe.

237
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:03,498
Sometimes underneath
the horse would get dirty.

238
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:05,498
So they would stick it right--

239
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:09,430
l can't believe this is how
l'm spending my anniversary.

240
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,007
l'll take you someplace nice.
A guy tipped me $ 1 00.

241
00:17:14,478 --> 00:17:17,709
He was playing blackjack
for an hour and he won $5000.

242
00:17:18,015 --> 00:17:19,642
Can you believe that?

243
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,045
lf l won $5000, l'd join a gym.

244
00:17:22,286 --> 00:17:23,719
Build up my upper body...

245
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:26,446
...and hit Richard from behind
with a stick.

246
00:17:27,725 --> 00:17:30,558
Wait! Why don't l just
do what that guy did?

247
00:17:30,828 --> 00:17:32,955
l'll take this $ 1 00,
turn it into $5000...

248
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:36,462
...and l'll turn that into enough
to get my movie going!

249
00:17:37,468 --> 00:17:38,730
Good luck.

250
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,370
l don't need luck.
l've thought this through.

251
00:17:41,606 --> 00:17:42,630
l see.

252
00:17:51,415 --> 00:17:52,848
Thanks.

253
00:17:53,017 --> 00:17:56,475
l can't believe this.
This is like the worst night ever.

254
00:17:56,687 --> 00:18:00,054
You had a minor setback
in your relationship.

255
00:18:00,324 --> 00:18:01,985
Big deal.
lt's only Chandler.

256
00:18:03,894 --> 00:18:06,522
l am so sorry.

257
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:11,527
This is crazy.
Such a stupid argument....

258
00:18:11,802 --> 00:18:13,497
l don't wanna see Richard.

259
00:18:13,704 --> 00:18:15,672
So go fix it.

260
00:18:15,906 --> 00:18:18,636
Find Chandler.
He's probably in your room.

261
00:18:18,843 --> 00:18:20,708
Tell him sorry and you love him.

262
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:23,008
You're right, Phoebe.

263
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:24,704
-Thank you.
-Sure.

264
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:29,215
Yeah! Las Vegas! Number one!

265
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,297
Anybody lose this?

266
00:18:41,465 --> 00:18:43,729
Coming out.
Place your bet.

267
00:18:44,735 --> 00:18:46,293
Dice her out.

268
00:18:48,572 --> 00:18:50,597
Yellow 1 1 . Pay the front line!

269
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:02,842
So l'm on my way back to the bathroom.

270
00:19:05,823 --> 00:19:09,122
All right, all right.
Just keep walking, all right?

271
00:19:18,836 --> 00:19:20,667
What are you--?
l am sorry, sir.

272
00:19:20,871 --> 00:19:23,863
l think he just really likes you.

273
00:19:29,613 --> 00:19:33,140
You know that teacher who had a baby
with her student?

274
00:19:44,795 --> 00:19:46,285
-Can l help you?
-Yes.

275
00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:51,332
Do you have any extra pants? My friend
seems to have had a little accident.

276
00:19:57,007 --> 00:19:59,635
-Can l change $ 1 00?
-Changing $ 1 00.

277
00:20:00,745 --> 00:20:03,009
-Good luck, sir.
-Thanks.

278
00:20:04,882 --> 00:20:06,213
That's right.

279
00:20:11,188 --> 00:20:13,247
-Thirteen.
-Hit me!

280
00:20:14,725 --> 00:20:16,716
Oh, man!

281
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,690
Wait!

282
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,993
You are not gonna believe this!

283
00:20:25,202 --> 00:20:27,932
l have found my identical hand twin.

284
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:33,237
What?

285
00:20:34,111 --> 00:20:36,011
My identical hand twin!

286
00:20:37,448 --> 00:20:39,143
What's an identical hand twin?

287
00:20:39,316 --> 00:20:40,806
What does it sound like?

288
00:20:40,985 --> 00:20:44,148
lt's a guy with my identical hands.

289
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:47,984
lt was incredible. The dealer's hands
were exactly like mine.

290
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:50,658
lt was like looking
at my hands in a mirror!

291
00:20:52,296 --> 00:20:55,197
You sure you weren't
looking at your hands in a mirror?

292
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,068
Don't you see what this means?
l can forget about that stupid movie.

293
00:21:00,538 --> 00:21:02,130
l'm gonna be a millionaire!

294
00:21:04,475 --> 00:21:07,933
-How?
-l don't have it all worked out yet.

295
00:21:08,212 --> 00:21:11,807
But it's gotta mean big money.
Come on, identical hands!

296
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,441
Again, l must go back to...

297
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:17,118
...how?

298
00:21:18,489 --> 00:21:22,220
This is Vegas, man.
People will pay to see freaky stuff!

299
00:21:24,128 --> 00:21:26,722
How much would you pay
to see this hand...

300
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:28,659
...twice?

301
00:21:32,469 --> 00:21:34,994
l can't really put a price on that.

302
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,899
Are you un-supporting me again?

303
00:21:39,677 --> 00:21:43,306
l support you 1 00%.
l just didn't get it right away.

304
00:21:43,581 --> 00:21:44,980
Now l'm caught up.

305
00:21:45,249 --> 00:21:47,012
ldentical hand twins.

306
00:21:47,318 --> 00:21:48,751
lt's a million-dollar idea!

307
00:21:48,953 --> 00:21:52,445
Right? l know.
Okay. All right.

308
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:53,612
What's that for?

309
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:58,251
Well, l gotta document this
before that dealer gets off his break.

310
00:22:03,534 --> 00:22:05,399
l found my identical hand twin!

311
00:22:05,603 --> 00:22:07,798
Oh, you're so lucky!

312
00:22:12,476 --> 00:22:15,274
So where's Monica?
Did you guys make up?

313
00:22:16,714 --> 00:22:18,409
But she just came up here.

314
00:22:18,749 --> 00:22:20,307
That was Joey.

315
00:22:20,951 --> 00:22:23,078
l wonder where she is?
lt's so weird.

316
00:22:23,287 --> 00:22:25,152
She's probably talking to Richard.

317
00:22:25,422 --> 00:22:27,083
Would you stop that?

318
00:22:27,725 --> 00:22:30,990
You know what she said
after her lunch with Richard?

319
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:34,060
She didn't feel anything for him.
She loves you.

320
00:22:35,432 --> 00:22:37,093
-Really?
-Yes.

321
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:41,738
She feels terrible. She really wants
to make up. You've gotta find her.

322
00:22:45,175 --> 00:22:46,403
Good.

323
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,775
l should really start wearing hats.

324
00:23:41,899 --> 00:23:43,958
Welcome to Las Vegas.

325
00:23:45,135 --> 00:23:47,262
-Did you enjoy your flight?
-l did.

326
00:23:47,471 --> 00:23:49,996
Thank you very much.
lt was excellent.

327
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:55,201
-l hope you had a nice flight.
-Oh, it was the best.

328
00:24:00,384 --> 00:24:02,784
l think the check-in is that way.

329
00:24:10,661 --> 00:24:12,561
Kids love me.

330
00:24:13,797 --> 00:24:15,731
Hi, you guys are here!

331
00:24:16,633 --> 00:24:19,397
What'd you do?
Did you go to a costume party?

332
00:24:20,304 --> 00:24:22,704
Let me guess.
Pancho Villa.

333
00:24:24,808 --> 00:24:26,673
And you're Bob Saget.

334
00:24:29,013 --> 00:24:30,071
Pancho Villa?

335
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:35,018
What are you talking about, Pheebs?
l don't--

336
00:24:38,188 --> 00:24:40,850
Oh, my God! You drew on me?

337
00:24:41,058 --> 00:24:43,151
Hey, you wet my pants!

338
00:24:44,094 --> 00:24:45,823
What kind of party was this?

339
00:24:46,864 --> 00:24:50,527
l've been walking around like this?
You have so crossed a line.

340
00:24:51,335 --> 00:24:54,065
Rach, wait.
The men's room is that way.

341
00:25:00,611 --> 00:25:03,944
lt's the third time she's won
on a machine l was playing.

342
00:25:05,115 --> 00:25:06,878
l bet she's one of those people.

343
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,751
Mole people?

344
00:25:10,621 --> 00:25:11,952
What? No, a lurker.

345
00:25:12,856 --> 00:25:13,845
What's that?

346
00:25:14,024 --> 00:25:16,754
When you're playing a machine
and it hasn't paid out...

347
00:25:17,027 --> 00:25:19,359
...a lurker waits for you
to give up and then--

348
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:20,585
Kills you?

349
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:25,458
They swoop in and steal your jackpot.

350
00:25:27,604 --> 00:25:30,698
-How do you know about this?
-My nana used to do it.

351
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:33,969
That's how she paid for my dance--
Karate lessons.

352
00:25:34,945 --> 00:25:36,276
Dance karate?

353
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,040
Yes, it's a deadly...

354
00:25:39,249 --> 00:25:41,114
...but beautiful sport.

355
00:25:45,122 --> 00:25:47,147
-lt won't come off.
-What?

356
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:48,550
lt won't come off.

357
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:50,953
Oh, my God. Rach, are you sure?

358
00:25:51,161 --> 00:25:53,595
l took it off
and then l drew it back on.

359
00:25:55,499 --> 00:25:58,798
Rach, l'm sorry. l'm so sorry.
l'm sure we can get it off, okay?

360
00:25:58,969 --> 00:26:01,403
-Just give me your pen.
-Why? What are you gonna do?

361
00:26:01,572 --> 00:26:03,870
Well, l believe l'm going
to stab you repeatedly.

362
00:26:05,075 --> 00:26:08,442
Not here. There are cameras everywhere.

363
00:26:09,746 --> 00:26:10,735
You made it!

364
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,149
Who's your friend?
He's hot.

365
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,909
Thanks, man.

366
00:26:18,188 --> 00:26:22,249
Listen, l talked to Chandler.
And l'm sorry about the movie.

367
00:26:22,459 --> 00:26:23,448
Don't be sorry.

368
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:27,027
l don't need it anymore.
l found my identical hand twin.

369
00:26:27,764 --> 00:26:28,753
Your what?

370
00:26:28,966 --> 00:26:32,458
My identical hand twin.
The person whose hands are like mine.

371
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:37,532
-Were you looking for this person?
-Not even. This thing is a gold mine.

372
00:26:37,741 --> 00:26:38,969
What?

373
00:26:40,577 --> 00:26:42,670
That won't make you any money.

374
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,211
Well, fine.

375
00:26:44,481 --> 00:26:47,882
None of you will live with me
in my hand-shaped mansion.

376
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,152
Except you.
You can live in the thumb.

377
00:26:54,892 --> 00:26:56,883
All right, baby, come on!

378
00:26:58,395 --> 00:26:59,794
l am on fire!

379
00:26:59,997 --> 00:27:01,362
See you later.

380
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:02,999
What are you doing?

381
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,861
What's it look like?
Going home.

382
00:27:05,068 --> 00:27:06,296
Why?

383
00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:13,132
Wait. Sorry, l was just playing
for one second.

384
00:27:13,343 --> 00:27:16,676
lf you don't want me to see
Richard again, l won't.

385
00:27:16,914 --> 00:27:18,541
He means nothing to me.

386
00:27:18,749 --> 00:27:21,081
Oh, come on. l was there.

387
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,583
l know he's the love of your life.

388
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,221
Not anymore.

389
00:27:29,593 --> 00:27:31,117
Really?

390
00:27:31,495 --> 00:27:33,156
Really.

391
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:37,732
All right?

392
00:27:37,935 --> 00:27:41,769
Let's forget about going home
and celebrate our anniversary.

393
00:27:43,574 --> 00:27:45,041
Okay, this is empty.

394
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:49,208
l wanted to make a dramatic scene,
but l hate packing.

395
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,648
Where's the other guy?

396
00:27:57,854 --> 00:27:59,116
Which guy?

397
00:27:59,356 --> 00:28:02,018
Tall, dark hair, hand looks
exactly like this?

398
00:28:02,793 --> 00:28:06,285
l don't know about the hands,
but he went to the restroom.

399
00:28:13,103 --> 00:28:14,627
How you doing?

400
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:18,434
-Very busy.
-Right. Okay.

401
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,915
Yes, hello. l have a question.

402
00:28:26,216 --> 00:28:30,380
l used your pen to draw
on my friend's face.

403
00:28:31,221 --> 00:28:33,280
A beard and a mustache.

404
00:28:35,993 --> 00:28:36,982
Thank you.

405
00:28:39,396 --> 00:28:41,455
No, she didn't think so.

406
00:28:41,732 --> 00:28:43,723
l know. lt's like--
Anyway....

407
00:28:45,335 --> 00:28:49,499
Makeup didn't cover it, we've tried
everything and nothing's worked.

408
00:28:49,806 --> 00:28:51,637
What do we do?

409
00:28:58,248 --> 00:28:59,909
Thank you.

410
00:29:00,317 --> 00:29:02,182
Yeah, it's not coming off.

411
00:29:03,153 --> 00:29:04,984
What? What else did he say?

412
00:29:05,188 --> 00:29:08,453
He said he thought l was funny.

413
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,452
Okay, look.
Let's just go downstairs...

414
00:29:13,697 --> 00:29:17,030
...we'll have some fun
and you will forget all about it.

415
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:20,327
There's no way l am leaving
looking like this!

416
00:29:20,537 --> 00:29:22,630
Come on, Rach. lt's not that bad.

417
00:29:22,873 --> 00:29:24,864
Ross, l am a human doodle!

418
00:29:26,343 --> 00:29:30,609
Just because some idiot drew on your
face doesn't mean you can't have fun.

419
00:29:30,847 --> 00:29:33,042
Besides, no one will
even look at you.

420
00:29:33,283 --> 00:29:37,117
This is Vegas. Hello?
There are tons of other freaks here.

421
00:29:38,655 --> 00:29:43,718
There are tons of freaks here.
No other. No.

422
00:29:43,994 --> 00:29:46,656
Come on. No one will notice. l swear.

423
00:29:53,837 --> 00:29:56,567
There was some staring and pointing.

424
00:29:58,575 --> 00:29:59,735
l need a drink.

425
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,138
They really overcharge you
for that stuff.

426
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:07,973
But who cares,
because it's all on me.

427
00:30:12,556 --> 00:30:15,150
That is one big drink.

428
00:30:16,093 --> 00:30:18,027
Macadamia nut?

429
00:30:18,495 --> 00:30:20,986
Wow! That's some pricey nut.

430
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:25,597
Really like those macadamia nuts?

431
00:30:26,103 --> 00:30:27,092
Nope.

432
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:43,579
Get out of here, you lurker!

433
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,151
Go on, get!

434
00:30:48,725 --> 00:30:49,987
You made up.

435
00:30:50,727 --> 00:30:52,752
l couldn't be mad at him
for too long.

436
00:30:52,963 --> 00:30:54,897
She couldn't live
without the ''Chand love.''

437
00:30:59,136 --> 00:31:00,125
Get a room.

438
00:31:01,471 --> 00:31:03,439
-We have one.
-Use it.

439
00:31:05,842 --> 00:31:08,276
Bye, Chandler. Bye, Mon.

440
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:19,314
<i>Pheebs, Pheebs. Please pick up</i>
<i>a house phone.</i>

441
00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:22,356
<i>You have a call from Chandler and Mon.</i>

442
00:31:25,295 --> 00:31:29,026
Hello, Chandler and Mon.
Hello?

443
00:31:34,171 --> 00:31:36,639
You dirty lurker!

444
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:42,342
l'm sorry, you are the same old lady, right?
Yeah. Dirty lurker!

445
00:31:47,918 --> 00:31:50,614
That's right.
Take good care of those babies.

446
00:31:51,254 --> 00:31:52,243
Excuse me?

447
00:31:52,456 --> 00:31:53,445
lt's me. Joey.

448
00:31:53,657 --> 00:31:54,851
Do l know you?

449
00:31:56,193 --> 00:31:57,592
Joey?

450
00:32:01,097 --> 00:32:03,361
Yeah, the hand guy.

451
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:06,966
So, what are we gonna do
about this hand twin thing?

452
00:32:08,171 --> 00:32:09,365
Nothing.

453
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,434
Look, you and l have been given a gift.

454
00:32:13,643 --> 00:32:17,545
We have to do something with it.
Like hand modeling. Or magic.

455
00:32:17,781 --> 00:32:20,545
And you know NASA's
gonna want to talk to us.

456
00:32:22,152 --> 00:32:24,017
l have to get back to work.

457
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:26,113
We can have our own show.

458
00:32:26,323 --> 00:32:29,554
We can clap our hands together.
People will love it!

459
00:32:31,528 --> 00:32:33,519
And l wrote a song for us.

460
00:32:33,797 --> 00:32:36,322
<i>This hand is your hand</i>

461
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:39,867
<i>This hand is my hand</i>

462
00:32:40,403 --> 00:32:42,667
<i>Oh, wait, that's your hand</i>

463
00:32:44,641 --> 00:32:47,041
<i>No, wait, it's my hand</i>

464
00:32:49,546 --> 00:32:53,209
-That's okay.
-But you haven't even heard the chorus!

465
00:32:55,752 --> 00:32:56,980
Oh, my God.

466
00:32:57,354 --> 00:32:59,822
l look like my great-aunt Muriel.

467
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,057
All right, you know what?

468
00:33:02,325 --> 00:33:04,384
We don't have to go downstairs.

469
00:33:04,594 --> 00:33:07,222
We can bring Vegas up to us.

470
00:33:07,497 --> 00:33:08,691
All right, come on.

471
00:33:08,932 --> 00:33:11,594
We'll play some blackjack.
Here we go.

472
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:13,258
-Thirteen.
-Hit me.

473
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,070
Twenty-three.

474
00:33:17,507 --> 00:33:21,170
Which is what we play to
at this casino!

475
00:33:22,846 --> 00:33:24,404
You win 1 0 dollars!

476
00:33:24,614 --> 00:33:26,775
-l bet 20.
-Right.

477
00:33:32,022 --> 00:33:34,923
A new pair of shoes
for the Chan-Chan man!

478
00:33:37,427 --> 00:33:39,520
l've never seen a roll like this!

479
00:33:39,763 --> 00:33:40,957
That's right, baby!

480
00:33:41,197 --> 00:33:42,528
What do l want now?

481
00:33:44,301 --> 00:33:45,563
Eight?

482
00:33:45,969 --> 00:33:49,928
-Six.
-Pick a number! That is your only job.

483
00:33:50,206 --> 00:33:51,400
-Eight.
-Thank you.

484
00:33:51,608 --> 00:33:54,475
lf you get this,
we buy everybody a steak dinner.

485
00:33:57,747 --> 00:33:59,214
Eight it is.

486
00:34:00,483 --> 00:34:02,451
We're not buying steak dinners, are we?

487
00:34:02,652 --> 00:34:04,313
-No.
-Okay, good.

488
00:34:05,722 --> 00:34:07,883
-What do l want now?
-Try a hard eight.

489
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:09,615
-What?
-Two fours.

490
00:34:10,994 --> 00:34:12,325
Eight!

491
00:34:13,296 --> 00:34:16,288
Don't you let her go.
You're a lucky guy.

492
00:34:16,499 --> 00:34:18,729
Thank you, Mr. Drunken Gambler.

493
00:34:19,502 --> 00:34:22,938
You get this and we get
the biggest suite in the place.

494
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:29,140
We get the biggest suite in the place.

495
00:34:29,346 --> 00:34:31,109
The biggest suite in the place!

496
00:34:31,314 --> 00:34:32,474
Come on!

497
00:34:34,317 --> 00:34:36,683
l love you!
l can't remember why we fought.

498
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:38,852
Because l had lunch with Rich--

499
00:34:39,155 --> 00:34:40,417
Me neither!

500
00:34:41,157 --> 00:34:43,148
-What now?
-Another hard eight.

501
00:34:43,426 --> 00:34:45,587
Hard eight?
Let's call it easy eight!

502
00:34:45,862 --> 00:34:49,161
l'll tell you what.
You roll another hard eight...

503
00:34:49,866 --> 00:34:52,494
...and we get married here tonight.

504
00:34:57,374 --> 00:34:59,001
Shut up!

505
00:35:01,444 --> 00:35:03,844
lt just got interesting!

506
00:35:07,283 --> 00:35:08,545
What did you say?

507
00:35:08,952 --> 00:35:11,819
You roll another hard eight,
we get married tonight.

508
00:35:12,822 --> 00:35:14,119
You serious?

509
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,757
Yes. l love you.

510
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:18,484
l've never loved anybody
as much as l love you.

511
00:35:19,629 --> 00:35:22,120
l've never loved anybody
as much as l love you.

512
00:35:22,532 --> 00:35:26,366
So if an eight comes up,
we take it as a sign and we do it.

513
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:28,059
What do you say?

514
00:35:36,212 --> 00:35:37,236
That's a four.

515
00:35:37,514 --> 00:35:40,415
-And where's the other one?
-Under the table.

516
00:35:41,051 --> 00:35:44,248
Nobody move!
You look that way, l look this way.

517
00:35:48,992 --> 00:35:50,391
Here it is, here it is.

518
00:35:52,195 --> 00:35:53,594
That could be 4 or 5.

519
00:35:56,666 --> 00:35:58,099
lt's your call.

520
00:36:01,671 --> 00:36:03,332
lt's a four.

521
00:36:06,743 --> 00:36:08,267
l think so too.

522
00:36:35,271 --> 00:36:37,739
Oh, well, lost again.

523
00:36:42,145 --> 00:36:44,443
That's it. You and me. Outside!

524
00:36:44,647 --> 00:36:48,208
l wouldn't want you to lose a chunk
of that pretty blond hair!

525
00:36:53,389 --> 00:36:54,617
Be cool.

526
00:36:58,428 --> 00:37:00,555
Okay, your lurking days are over.

527
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:01,754
What?

528
00:37:01,965 --> 00:37:04,433
Everyone you lurk,
l'll lurk first.

529
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:07,431
You move on,
l'll be one step ahead of you...

530
00:37:07,637 --> 00:37:08,899
...every single time.

531
00:37:09,105 --> 00:37:12,734
And then l'll be on your ass
every hour of every day...

532
00:37:12,976 --> 00:37:14,568
...till Monday...

533
00:37:14,844 --> 00:37:17,142
...because that's when l go home.

534
00:37:17,914 --> 00:37:18,903
When do you leave?

535
00:37:19,115 --> 00:37:20,582
Also Monday.

536
00:37:20,817 --> 00:37:23,149
What time? Maybe we can share a cab.

537
00:37:25,588 --> 00:37:26,748
Hit me.

538
00:37:27,457 --> 00:37:28,822
Hit me.

539
00:37:39,002 --> 00:37:40,299
We need more cards.

540
00:37:41,938 --> 00:37:45,339
Yeah. And we also need more drinks.
Hold on a second.

541
00:37:48,945 --> 00:37:50,503
Hello, Vegas?

542
00:37:52,315 --> 00:37:53,873
We would like more alcohol.

543
00:37:54,184 --> 00:37:57,051
You know what else?
We would like some more beers.

544
00:37:59,889 --> 00:38:02,187
Oh, l forgot to dial.

545
00:38:05,962 --> 00:38:08,988
That must be our alcohol and beers.

546
00:38:13,837 --> 00:38:15,998
lt's Joey! l love Joey!

547
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:17,831
Oh, l love Joey!

548
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:19,338
Joey lives with a duck.

549
00:38:22,045 --> 00:38:23,910
Look, l need some help, okay?

550
00:38:24,214 --> 00:38:27,308
Someone has to convince
my hand twin to cooperate.

551
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:32,419
l'll do it. Whatever you need me to do,
l'm your man.

552
00:38:37,327 --> 00:38:39,261
Are you okay?

553
00:38:41,898 --> 00:38:43,866
Yeah. Fine. Thanks.

554
00:38:47,003 --> 00:38:48,061
Hey, Rach?

555
00:38:48,705 --> 00:38:50,434
How you doing?

556
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:55,840
l'm doing good, baby.
How you doing?

557
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,443
Don't let her drink anymore.

558
00:39:03,353 --> 00:39:07,187
Here's that macadamia nut.

559
00:39:09,225 --> 00:39:11,056
No, something else.

560
00:39:16,933 --> 00:39:18,798
So, what do you wanna do now?

561
00:39:19,035 --> 00:39:21,230
l wanna get out of the room.

562
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:26,133
l really miss downstairs.

563
00:39:26,943 --> 00:39:31,437
Okay, you know what? There is only
one way l am leaving this hotel room.

564
00:39:33,383 --> 00:39:34,975
Well, hello!

565
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:37,948

566
00:39:38,454 --> 00:39:41,821
-Good luck to you.
-Sir, you've got a little something....

567
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,791
Hello.

568
00:40:17,593 --> 00:40:18,787

569
00:40:19,095 --> 00:40:20,790
l won! l finally won!

570
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,759
l won! That was my quarter!

571
00:40:22,966 --> 00:40:24,024
Take a hike, toots.

572
00:40:26,636 --> 00:40:28,001
Excuse me, sir.

573
00:40:28,204 --> 00:40:30,866
This lady played my quarter.
This is my money.

574
00:40:31,107 --> 00:40:32,369
ls that true, miss?

575
00:40:33,943 --> 00:40:35,433
Sells drugs to kids.

576
00:40:37,814 --> 00:40:39,645
She sells drugs to kids.

577
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,018
lt was my quarter.

578
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:44,447
Was it her quarter?

579
00:40:45,188 --> 00:40:47,850
How about we talk
about this over dinner?

580
00:40:48,057 --> 00:40:51,823
-Okay, lady, you're out of here.
-No, you can't arrest me!

581
00:40:52,028 --> 00:40:54,121
l won't go back to that hellhole!

582
00:40:55,865 --> 00:40:58,356
l'm just taking you outside.

583
00:41:04,173 --> 00:41:09,076
l need something old, something new,
something borrowed and something blue.

584
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:12,477
Here's something blue and new.

585
00:41:12,682 --> 00:41:15,150
You are so efficient.
l love you.

586
00:41:15,551 --> 00:41:16,813
-Let's go.
-No, wait!

587
00:41:17,053 --> 00:41:18,577
We need something old.

588
00:41:18,821 --> 00:41:22,587
l have a condom in my wallet
that l've had since l was twelve.

589
00:41:24,527 --> 00:41:25,926
That'll work.

590
00:41:26,095 --> 00:41:28,063
l don't think so.

591
00:41:29,565 --> 00:41:30,691
Now something borrowed.

592
00:41:32,602 --> 00:41:34,092
Here, just take this.

593
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:36,565
That's stealing.

594
00:41:36,739 --> 00:41:38,934
We'll bring it back.
Put it under your dress.

595
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,588
Okay. One thing at a time.

596
00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:10,569
-Are you gonna play?
-No, l don't really have any money.

597
00:42:11,274 --> 00:42:13,936
Not yet, anyway.

598
00:42:15,478 --> 00:42:17,139
Can't sit here if you don't play.

599
00:42:32,929 --> 00:42:35,659
My name is Regina Falangie.

600
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,162
l'm a businesswoman
in town on business.

601
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:42,166
Would you like to see my card?

602
00:42:42,371 --> 00:42:44,168
What did l do with my Filofax?

603
00:42:44,373 --> 00:42:46,568
l must've left it
in Conference Room B.

604
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,701
-Fourteen.
-Hit me.

605
00:42:50,179 --> 00:42:51,237
Oh, my God.

606
00:42:51,414 --> 00:42:55,748
May l just say that you two gentlemen
have the exact same hands?

607
00:42:57,286 --> 00:42:58,651
They're identical.

608
00:42:58,855 --> 00:43:01,551
l've never seen that
in the business world.

609
00:43:03,226 --> 00:43:04,921
Stop it.

610
00:43:05,895 --> 00:43:10,696
Miss Falangie, may l ask you a question
as an impartial person at this table?

611
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,424
Please stop it.

612
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:17,296
Wouldn't you pay good money
to see identical hands...

613
00:43:17,573 --> 00:43:21,907
...showcased in some type
of an entertainment venue?

614
00:43:22,111 --> 00:43:25,979
lf you leave now, l will chop off
my hand and give it to you!

615
00:43:28,985 --> 00:43:30,748
Didn't l just throw you out?

616
00:43:31,254 --> 00:43:33,119
No, you threw out Phoebe.

617
00:43:33,322 --> 00:43:36,120
l'm Regina Falangie. Falangie.

618
00:43:36,726 --> 00:43:38,489
Come on, lady.

619
00:43:38,728 --> 00:43:40,059
Please take him too.

620
00:43:40,263 --> 00:43:42,925
Me? Oh, come on, man.

621
00:43:43,132 --> 00:43:44,326
Come on, buddy.

622
00:43:45,268 --> 00:43:47,498
Don't let him do this. Come on!

623
00:43:47,803 --> 00:43:50,397
l'm your hand twin!

624
00:43:54,644 --> 00:43:56,839
Hello. One marriage, please.

625
00:43:57,146 --> 00:43:58,511
We want to get married.

626
00:43:58,748 --> 00:44:01,410
There's a service in progress.
Have a seat.

627
00:44:01,918 --> 00:44:03,283
All right.

628
00:44:12,128 --> 00:44:13,152
What are you doing?

629
00:44:13,429 --> 00:44:16,125
The ''Wedding March.''
Does that freak you out?

630
00:44:16,332 --> 00:44:18,197
No, it's the graduation song.

631
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,407
This is it.
We're gonna get married.

632
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:29,202
You sure you wanna do this?

633
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:37,114
Hello, Mrs. Ross!

634
00:44:37,353 --> 00:44:40,447
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
