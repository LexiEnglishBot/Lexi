1
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,799
Well, that thing's clearly in the way.

2
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,094
All right. A-ha. Heh.

3
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:15,973
Damn fridge!

4
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:20,227
- Hi, Joey. How you doing?
- Great...

5
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,813
...roomie.
- Ah!

6
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:26,442
- Yeah, I guess we are roommates now.
- I know. Now that you bring it up...

7
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,320
...uh, our fridge is broken.
We have to get a new one.

8
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:34,199
I checked around and your half is $400.
Thanks a lot.

9
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,494
I'm not paying for half of that.

10
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:40,247
I'm only staying here
until my apartment gets fixed.

11
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:45,210
Look, Rach, my parents bought this fridge
just after I was born. Okay?

12
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:49,757
Now, I have never had a problem with it.
Then you show up and it breaks!

13
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:52,926
What does that tell you?

14
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,765
That refrigerators don't live
as long as people?

15
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,437
All right, you know that the ATM only
lets you take out 300 at a time...

16
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,564
...so I'll take a check
for the other 100.

17
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,108
Heh. You're joking, right?

18
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,821
Of course I'm joking.
I don't take checks.

19
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,617
Thank God you're pretty.

20
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,286
- Hey!
- Hey.

21
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,289
Hey, do you guys know
any cute guys?

22
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,417
Well, of course, I do.
My good friend, Joey, over here.

23
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:14,299
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you, Chandler.

24
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,638
Anyway, there's a charity ball this weekend
and Ralph Lauren bought a table...

25
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,056
...so I kind of have to go.

26
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,350
- What's the charity?
- I don't know.

27
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:27,604
Something, either trees or disease, I...

28
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,899
- Ralph mumbles a lot.
- Does Ralph mumble...

29
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:34,528
...when you're not paying attention?
- Yeah. It's weird.

30
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,573
But the thing is, I need to find a date.

31
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,408
What kind of guy
are you looking for?

32
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:43,495
Someone that has his own tux
or the ability to rent a tux.

33
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,373
So he has to be a male
who has at least $50.

34
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,709
Ooh, so close.

35
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,837
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey.

36
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,965
- Uh, this is Elizabeth.
- Hi, Elizabeth.

37
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,342
- I'm the student.
- Ha-ha-ha.

38
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,720
Isn't she cute? Nope.

39
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,725
This is none of my business,
but weren't you guys supposed...

40
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,020
...to not be seen in public together?
- Oh, we're not together.

41
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,273
No. We're just two people
who happen to have run into each other...

42
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,609
...here at the coffee house.
Heh, this is...

43
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,279
Oh, sly.

44
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,366
I really wanted to meet you guys,
but I have to run.

45
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,202
- I'll see you later?
- Okay.

46
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,536
- Bye, Ross.
- Bye. See you.

47
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,746
- Oh...
- Oops.

48
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:29,541
- Didn't mean to run into you like that, sir.
- That is quite all right, ma'am.

49
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,501
Bye.

50
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:35,380
So why's she leaving? Is it a school night
and she has a lot of homework to do?

51
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:39,092
Yes. Her molecular epidemiology paper
is due tomorrow.

52
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,888
Well, tell her "good luck" with that.

53
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,016
Anyone else, huh? Bring them on.

54
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,811
- Oh! When's her birthday?
- I don't know, Rachel. Why?

55
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,565
Well, you know it's just been so long
since I've been to Chuck E. Cheese.

56
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,945
- I like Elizabeth.
- Well, thanks.

57
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:01,865
In fact, I like her so much that you tell
her I want my cookies early this year.

58
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,245
A box of Thin Mints and some Tagalongs.

59
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,374
Guys, give him a break.
Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?

60
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,000
Well, it's actually been great.

61
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,836
She's 20, so she's not looking
for anything too serious...

62
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,256
...which is perfect for me now.

63
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,425
Well, that is great.
And seriously, she seems very nice.

64
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,803
I know you guys like
to give me a hard time...

65
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,097
...but it means a lot to me
that you like her.

66
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,433
- Just knowing you guys are, like...
- Okay, I got a good one.

67
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,061
Okay, um... Heh.

68
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,522
What is she, like, 12?

69
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,159
Chandler, do you think we talk
about our relationship enough?

70
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,037
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll Ups?

71
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,623
- Hey.
- Hey.

72
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,585
Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy
for Rachel to take to her thing.

73
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,713
That's so funny,
we found someone too.

74
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,592
That's good. I guess she'll have a choice
between my guy and your weirdo.

75
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,721
- Why would our guy be a weirdo?
- Because that's just your taste.

76
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,809
See, Rachel's not gonna pick
your stupid guy.

77
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,019
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:15,105
My guy is a lawyer
who does volunteer work.

79
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,191
And he has one of these.

80
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,444
A face ass?

81
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,449
- A chin dimple.
- Well, uh, our guy works with Chandler.

82
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:28,660
And he's really nice and smart
and he's a great dresser.

83
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:33,373
- Have you seen your guy's body?
- No. Our guy's just a floating head.

84
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,961
Well, my guy is spectacular, okay?
He's a massage client.

85
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:43,467
And one time, um, when he was on the
table, I looked at it. And I mean, all of it.

86
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,512
- You're not supposed to look.
- Yeah, like there are police for that.

87
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,100
- What, you look? You massaged me.
- I know.

88
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,606
All right, your guy may have
a great body, but our guy...

89
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,275
...is really funny.
- Chandler funny?

90
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,321
- Our guy's a great dancer.
- My guy's well-read.

91
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,740
- Our guy has great hair.
- My guy has great teeth.

92
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,910
Our guys smells incredible.

93
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,454
Do you want our guy to be your guy?

94
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,833
- Hey.
- Hey.

95
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,008
Well, you don't look good, Joe.

96
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,470
Well, the fridge broke,
so I had to eat everything.

97
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,849
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.

98
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,894
Hey, what was in that brown jar?

99
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,979
- That's still in there?
- Not anymore.

100
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,526
Ahem, so, anyway,
how do you want to pay me?

101
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,655
Is this a service you're providing me?

102
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:52,035
No, for my new fridge.
For our new fridge.

103
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,495
Our new fridge?

104
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,206
- I don't live here anymore.
- So what?

105
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:59,251
Look, okay, suppose we were
a, uh, divorced couple.

106
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,629
- Uh-huh.
- And I got custody of the kid. Right?

107
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:07,384
Now, suppose the kid dies
and I gotta buy a new kid.

108
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,763
Okay.

109
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,058
Give me $400!

110
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,233
- Professor Geller?
- Hmm?

111
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,944
Oh, a student I don't know.

112
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,323
I was wondering
if I could talk to you for a moment?

113
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,160
Yes, of course.
What would this be regarding?

114
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,537
- Making out in your office.
- Wh... Shh!

115
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,541
Uh, of course. Why don't we go inside.

116
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,550
Mm... Oh, oh.

117
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,635
- What?
- Doorknob. Doorknob.

118
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,221
Sorry. Ha-ha-ha.

119
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,683
- Um, I actually do need to talk to you.
- Oh. Okay, what about?

120
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,311
- Spring vacation.
- Spring vacation?

121
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,689
Yeah, we have time off,
and a lot of people are going on trips...

122
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:07,194
- Professor Geller.
- Yes, Professor Fiesenstinlender?

123
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,863
I'll be with you in one moment.

124
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,451
So I will take one box
of the Thin Mints.

125
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:23,585
You don't understand. Elizabeth was
about to ask me to go on a trip with her.

126
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,588
Is that taking it slow?
I'm not ready for this, okay?

127
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,050
- What do I tell her?
- Tell her the truth. You're not ready.

128
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,803
I could do that.

129
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:37,516
- Well, what if she gets upset?
- Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.

130
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,645
Or...

131
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,523
...you could just, you know, you...

132
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,779
What the hell are you doing?

133
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,656
Wha...?

134
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:56,326
What the hell am I doing?
You just broke my fridge!

135
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,790
What? How do you know if...
How do you know it's even broken?

136
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,459
Oh, you think I don't know
what breaks my fridge?

137
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,587
Excuse me.

138
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,133
Well, what do you know? Broken!

139
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,803
That'll be $400.

140
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,931
Joey, I saw you push him.

141
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,310
You pushed him.

142
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:29,693
Joey, I did not break this. Okay?
That has been broken for a while.

143
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,531
- Remember I told you about our fridge?
- Uh-huh.

144
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,284
I still haven't gotten the check
for your half yet.

145
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,161
Do not give him any money.

146
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,956
I'm not talking to you!
You broke my fridge!

147
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:56,177
- You wanted to see me, Professor Geller?
- Yes. Yes. Please come in.

148
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,016
Mm, ooh, ooh.

149
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:04,144
- Doorknob?
- Yeah. It kind of grows on you.

150
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,773
Actually, I wanted to finish
talking to you about spring vacation.

151
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,650
Oh, good.

152
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,404
Look, I...

153
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,952
Look, I've been having
a great time with you.

154
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,916
And I just don't want us to move too fast
or put too much pressure on us.

155
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:30,128
So I'm sorry, I just don't think
we should go away together yet.

156
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,463
It's too soon.

157
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,717
Uh, Ross, I think you misunderstood
what I was saying.

158
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:40,263
I just wanted to tell you that
I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.

159
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,518
No.

160
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,482
I think you misunderstood
what I was saying.

161
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,985
- What I meant was...
- You are so adorable.

162
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,697
That. Let's talk about that.

163
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,993
- Hey.
- Hey.

164
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,204
- How did it go with Elizabeth?
- Huh? Oh, oh.

165
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:08,166
Fine. It was just a misunderstanding.
She didn't want me to go with her.

166
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:12,045
She just wanted to let me know that
she's going to Florida for spring vacation.

167
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,215
Wait, is she going for spring vacation
or going for spring break.

168
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,844
What's the difference?

169
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,223
A spring vacation, you're doing nice things
with your grandparents.

170
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,184
Spring break, you're doing frat guys.

171
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,855
Hey, you know what?
Not all spring breaks are like that.

172
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,983
- What did you do on yours?
- I went to Egypt with my dad.

173
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,321
I can see it now.
"Look, Dad, it's the Sphinx."

174
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,160
I think Elizabeth is a little more
serious than, "Spring break!"

175
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,873
All right?
Come on, she's taking my class.

176
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,252
- And slept with the professor.
- I'm gonna call her.

177
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,883
Hey, you guys,
I want you to meet Sebastian.

178
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,301
- Hi.
- We just, uh...

179
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:05,140
We just met at the newsstand. We both
grabbed for the last Field and Stream. Ha!

180
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,934
What, I read that.

181
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,980
- Can I get you a cup of coffee?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

182
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,403
- Rachel, what the hell is this?
- What?

183
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,699
You ask us to find you a guy, and then
you come in here with a guy of your own.

184
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,242
- You found me a guy?
- Yes.

185
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,746
We found you a really cute,
funny guy from Chandler's work.

186
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,207
Yeah, and I found you one, too,
who is not a weirdo.

187
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,503
You know what though, guys,
I really appreciate that...

188
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,256
...but I'm just gonna take Sebastian
to the charity.

189
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,134
Are you sure?
Because our guy smells incredible.

190
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,304
Would you stop it with that already?

191
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,182
- Here you go. Sure.
- Oh, thank you.

192
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,269
So, Sebastian,
do you do any volunteer work?

193
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,646
- Uh, no, not really. Why?
- No reason.

194
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:57,233
It's just I know a single guy
who does care about other people.

195
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,195
Are you funny?

196
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,948
- Excuse me?
- What are you guys doing?

197
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,367
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!

198
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,121
Look, I just wanted
to have coffee with Rachel.

199
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,873
Well, so do a lot of people.

200
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,586
- Actually, uh, I gotta get going.
- Oh, but you...

201
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:20,131
- Give me a call sometime.
- But you didn't give me your number.

202
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,966
Okay, see you later.

203
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,136
Turns out he is kind of funny.

204
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,894
I cannot believe you guys!

205
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,022
He was really nice
and he just left because of you!

206
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,192
Yeah, but, "Sebastian"?
What is that, a cat's name?

207
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,696
You know what I noticed, Rachel,
he scares easy.

208
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,574
Now, is that the kind of guy
you want to take to a ball?

209
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,618
"Sebastian, would you like to dance?"

210
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,579
"Uh, okay. I gotta go. Aah!"

211
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,499
All right, guys stop it.
Rachel, we're very sorry.

212
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,418
That is a very insensitive thing
for us to do.

213
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,172
You know what? Let us make it up
to you. We've two great guys for you.

214
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,174
Yeah, what have you got to lose?

215
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:07,136
You might even end up with someone
really special. If you pick my guy.

216
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,391
- All right.
- Okay. So you will meet our guys?

217
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,976
Yes, I'll meet them.

218
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,687
It doesn't matter which one you choose.
It's up to you.

219
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,273
Our guy is perfect.

220
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,692
Or you could go out with the guy
Phoebe deemed...

221
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,736
...not good enough to go out with herself.
- Ugh!

222
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,155
Phoebe, there you are!
Okay, you broke my fridge.

223
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,241
You owe me 400 bucks.

224
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,786
- Okay, sure.
- Really?

225
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,666
Ooh, technically, you owe me $600
for sending out happy thoughts...

226
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,835
...on your last 10 auditions.

227
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,508
Call it even?

228
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,636
Okay.

229
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,891
There you are.
So, what did Elizabeth say?

230
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:58,021
Well, turns out she is going to Daytona
for "spring break, woo-hoo."

231
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:02,150
That means wet T-shirt contests,
guys doing shots off of girls' bodies...

232
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,485
...waking up next to people
you don't even know.

233
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,405
Man, she is gonna have a great time!

234
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,784
Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?

235
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,996
- You know the hotels?
- I was there, Spring Break '81!

236
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,083
In 1981, you were 13.

237
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,420
So what? I drove down,
sold T-shirts. I had a blast.

238
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,799
You know who knows how to party?
Drunk college chicks.

239
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,929
Okay, she can't go.

240
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,973
You can't tell her not to go.
You just started dating.

241
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:37,185
- Then what am I supposed to do?
- Nothing. Just be cool with it.

242
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,188
What if she goes down there
and sleeps with a bunch of guys?

243
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,024
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.

244
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,909
I'm so glad you're going on this trip.

245
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,579
Yeah, I've been working
so hard this semester.

246
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,374
I really need to go crazy, you know?
Blow off some steam.

247
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,501
Sure. Sure.

248
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:07,256
Look, I don't know if your plans
are finalized yet...

249
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:10,343
...but I know another great way
to blow off steam.

250
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,429
- What?
- Are you into crafts at all?

251
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,351
- Ross, are you okay?
- Uh, yeah. Of course I'm okay.

252
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,979
Heh, I'm just being, uh, supportive.

253
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,065
Supportive of you and this whole trip...

254
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,276
...and what... What is, uh...? What's this?

255
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:33,116
- It's a bathing suit?
- To wear in front of people?

256
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,953
- Is that supportive?
- Is this?

257
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,124
- Hey.
- Good, good, good.

258
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,542
- Hey.
- Hi.

259
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,752
- We're glad you decided to meet our guy.
- Oh.

260
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,587
You're gonna like him so much.

261
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,382
- Uh, when do you want to meet him?
- I don't know.

262
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,760
- I don't work late tomorrow night.
- Tomorrow night is good.

263
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:56,973
But why put off something till tomorrow
that you can do right now. Ha-ha-ha.

264
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,975
- Eldad, come here!
- What?

265
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,895
- Eldad, this is Rachel.
- How are you?

266
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,481
A little blind-sided,
but, you know, good.

267
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:10,069
Eldad, sit down. Move over.
Move over now.

268
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,155
There you go. There you are.

269
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,950
- Okay, we can take a hint!
- Ha-ha-ha.

270
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:20,413
- Wait. What are you doing here?
- This is Patrick.

271
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,789
- Hi.
- Hi.

272
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,584
You're too late,
because she's already with our guy.

273
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:29,547
Oh, my God, you're right, I am too late.
They're sitting on the couch and talking.

274
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,549
Come on.

275
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,303
- Rachel? This is Patrick.
- Yeah?

276
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,721
- Oh. Hi.
- Hi.

277
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,973
This is the guy
I was telling you about.

278
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:43,102
Believe me, this suit does not do justice
to what's underneath it.

279
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,730
Okay.

280
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,734
But Pheebs, I'm just sort of
in the middle of something.

281
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,487
Oh, okay. That's okay. Have a seat.

282
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,615
- You can't do that!
- Maybe I should go.

283
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,867
Just sit down, we're winning.

284
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,912
Okay, you know what?
Maybe I should go.

285
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,914
- No, no!
- Have a seat!

286
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,666
Rachel, you haven't touched
Eldad's hair.

287
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,920
- It is the softest hair. Touch it.
- I'm good.

288
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,131
Rachel, Patrick is really rich.
Give her some money.

289
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,762
Phoebe, this isn't really worth
the free massage.

290
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,014
That's right, Patrick. Bye-bye.

291
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,309
Eldad is much more cooperative
and he can dance.

292
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,478
You dance for Rachel.

293
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,980
No, don't dance for me, please!

294
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,316
What is the matter with you guys?

295
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,443
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.

296
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,030
Am I the only one
that this is embarrassing for?

297
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,158
- I'm a little embarrassed.
- Shh, shh.

298
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:44,413
I'll tell you who should be embarrassed.
It's you guys. This is ridiculous!

299
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,916
Thank you,
but I do not need you to get me a date.

300
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,585
- Then why did she ask us to help...
- I am still talking!

301
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,880
Then you chase away
the one guy that I actually liked.

302
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:56,509
No offense to you guys.
Really, congratulations on...

303
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,719
...all the cash.

304
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:02,098
And you really...
Wow, you do have very soft hair.

305
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:07,520
But I'd much rather go to the ball by myself
than go through any more of this!

306
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,355
Goodbye.

307
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,443
Now, do you use some sort
of special conditioner on that hair?

308
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,822
- Yes, papaya extract.
- Thank you.

309
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:27,123
- So, uh, have a great time down there.
- I will.

310
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,209
- Did you pack that bathing suit?
- Yeah.

311
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,004
It was pretty funny
when I hid it for a while, huh?

312
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,010
Anyway. Um...

313
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,721
I am worried about that bathing suit.

314
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,765
Not because it's revealing,
which I'm fine with.

315
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,393
No, I'm concerned about your health.

316
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,188
Um, sun exposure.

317
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,565
Oh, don't worry,
I have plenty of sun block.

318
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,609
- It's SPF 30.
- All right.

319
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,820
Well, if what's in the bottle
is actually 30.

320
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,282
I mean, sometimes you get 30,
sometimes it's 4, and I swear...

321
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,826
...more often than not, it's just milk.

322
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,538
Ross, it's gonna be okay.

323
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,917
I'm not going down there
to hook up with a bunch of guys.

324
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,712
I really like you.
I like how things are going between us.

325
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,380
- Really?
- Yeah.

326
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,508
I'm just going down there to relax
and hang out with my friends.

327
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,137
Okay. Cool. Heh.

328
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,556
- Oh, here they are.
- Hey, Elizabeth!

329
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,187
Bye!

330
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,861
Call me!

331
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,245
Rachel, we're sorry
for pushing those guys on you.

332
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,122
That's all right.
I ended up having a really good time.

333
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:54,752
The charity was a big success,
they raised a lot of money and awareness.

334
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,338
So, what was it for, anyway?

335
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,466
I wanna say a disease.

336
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,928
- Hey.
- Hey.

337
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:08,432
I just got this weird message from Ross.
He said turn on MTV. I don't know.

338
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,607
- Oh, my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
Ha-ha-ha.

339
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,244
Oh, oh, Professor Geller.

340
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,040
Ah, to be 13 again.
