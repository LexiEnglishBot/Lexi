00:00:02,122 --> 00:00:07,021
Hi. So I'm doing the Soap Opera
Digest crossword puzzle...

2
00:00:07,272 --> 00:00:10,985
...and guess who is the clue
for three down?

3
00:00:11,203 --> 00:00:14,785
"Days of Our Lives star,
blank Tribbiani."

4
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:17,876
That's me! I'm blank!

5
00:00:18,613 --> 00:00:22,503
How cool! We know three down.
I'm touching three down.

6
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:24,378
Yeah, you are, baby.

7
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:28,523
Three down knows I'm married.
What's three down doing?

8
00:00:28,772 --> 00:00:31,346
Do they call to tell you you're in it?

9
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:35,266
No. They wanted to do
a profile on me. I said no.

10
00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:36,910
Why'd you say no?

11
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:39,731
Remember the last interview I did?

12
00:00:40,045 --> 00:00:43,414
I said I write my own lines,
the writers got mad...

13
00:00:43,698 --> 00:00:48,348
...and I fell down an elevator shaft.
Who knows what I'd say now?

14
00:00:48,604 --> 00:00:53,195
If only there was something
in your head to control what you say.

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,500
Come on, you'll keep it
in check this time.

16
00:00:56,745 --> 00:01:01,087
The publicity would be good for you.
You deserve that.

17
00:01:01,303 --> 00:01:06,867
In the interview, you could mention,
I don't know, "gal pal Rachel Green."

18
00:01:07,113 --> 00:01:11,241
Is that "gal pal" spelled L-O-S-E-R?

19
00:01:12,053 --> 00:01:17,024
- Okay, don't listen to him. Please?
- Fine, all right, I'll do it.

20
00:01:17,342 --> 00:01:21,470
You have to be there to stop me
if I say something stupid.

21
00:01:21,725 --> 00:01:26,482
Just then, or all the time?
Because we have jobs, you know?

22
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:30,977
We'll be there the whole time.
Just remember:

23
00:01:31,223 --> 00:01:34,449
Gal pal, Rachel Green.

24
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:41,133
I'm gonna be in Soap Opera Digest!
And not just in the dumb crossword.

25
00:01:41,382 --> 00:01:43,600
Seriously, proud of you.

26
00:01:44,514 --> 00:01:49,590
The One With Joeys Interview

27
00:02:22,402 --> 00:02:28,761
- Thanks for taking the time for this.
- Not at all. Happy to do it.

28
00:02:28,978 --> 00:02:31,266
You think we're being obvious?

29
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:36,725
No. We're just four people with
neck problems, who talk like this.

30
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:39,091
It's great that we met here.

31
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:45,360
When people hear the magazine's paying,
they want a big, fancy restaurant.

32
00:02:45,922 --> 00:02:49,362
Actually, I didn't know
the magazine was paying.

33
00:02:49,783 --> 00:02:54,504
Wouldn't have mattered. I do this
for the fans, not the free food.

34
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,190
- Can I get you anything?
- Coffee.

35
00:02:57,507 --> 00:03:00,461
And I'll have all the muffins.

36
00:03:03,247 --> 00:03:05,714
- Hey.
- We're not talking.

37
00:03:05,926 --> 00:03:08,215
Oh, finally.

38
00:03:09,962 --> 00:03:14,375
According to your bio,
you've done quite a bit of work.

39
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,959
Anything that you're
particularly proud of?

40
00:03:20,122 --> 00:03:23,383
All you want is a dingle

41
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:26,589
What you envy's a shwang

42
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:30,097
A thing through which you can tinkle

43
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:33,339
Or play with, or simply let hang

44
00:03:48,024 --> 00:03:51,358
This ever happen?
You want a glass of milk...

45
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:54,798
...but these darn cartons
are so hard to open!

46
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:56,855
Boy, you said it, Mike.

47
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:03,147
- There's gotta be a better way!
- There is, Kevin!

48
00:04:03,472 --> 00:04:07,779
This is the first time
he's ever used this. It's easy.

49
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:11,717
- This works in any milk carton.
- It is easy.

50
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:15,436
Now I can have milk every day.

51
00:04:16,345 --> 00:04:18,528
So this is it, Victor?

52
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:23,680
Yeah, I guess it is. And so...

53
00:04:25,287 --> 00:04:28,762
...I'm gonna get on this spaceship...

54
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:40,138
...and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7
in search of alternative fuels.

55
00:04:40,456 --> 00:04:46,921
But when I return 200 years from now,
you'll be long gone.

56
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,708
But I won't have aged at all.

57
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:57,883
So you tell your great-great-
granddaughter to look me up.

58
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:02,060
Because, Adrian...

59
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,107
...baby...

60
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,175
...I'm gonna want to meet her.

61
00:05:16,326 --> 00:05:19,660
Here I come.
I'm coming to fix the copier.

62
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:24,393
I can't get to the copier.
I'm thinking, "What do I do?"

63
00:05:25,442 --> 00:05:30,792
So I just watch them have sex.
And then I say... Wait, here's my line:

64
00:05:31,043 --> 00:05:34,305
You know, that's bad
for the paper tray.

65
00:05:36,053 --> 00:05:39,458
- Nice work, my friend.
- Wait, you see me again.

66
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,765
Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.

67
00:05:43,046 --> 00:05:46,106
There I am. There I am. There I am.

68
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:51,111
There are so many things,
it's hard to pick just one.

69
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:54,481
I'm getting coffee. Want anything?

70
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:58,865
- A blueberry muffin and chamomile tea.
- Double latte.

71
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,631
- A bagel with only...
- I was just being polite.

72
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,995
How about when you're not working?
What do you do in your spare time?

73
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,675
Look at this clown. He thinks
he can take up the whole river.

74
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,363
Get out of the way, jackass!

75
00:06:20,134 --> 00:06:23,811
Who names their boat
Coast Guard, anyway?

76
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:27,088
That is the Coast Guard.

77
00:06:27,336 --> 00:06:31,891
What are they doing out here?
The coast is way over there!

78
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,532
This is unbelievable.

79
00:06:34,782 --> 00:06:39,609
Joey has been holding his breath
for almost four minutes.

80
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,465
Dude, are you trying to kill me?

81
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:55,860
Well, I see you've had
a very productive day.

82
00:06:56,108 --> 00:07:00,236
- Isn't the cowboy hat a little much?
- Come on, it's fun!

83
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,219
All right.

84
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,947
Isn't this a woman's hat?

85
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,641
Dude, stop talking crazy
and make us some tea.

86
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,428
We have to turn off the porn.

87
00:07:22,306 --> 00:07:24,773
I think you're right.

88
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:27,899
- All right, ready?
- One.

89
00:07:28,117 --> 00:07:30,857
- Two, three.
- Three.

90
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:36,811
That's kind of nice.

91
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:39,347
- It's kind of a relief.
- Yeah.

92
00:07:46,104 --> 00:07:49,129
- You wanna see if we still have it?
- Yeah.

93
00:07:49,932 --> 00:07:52,565
Free porn! We have free porn here!

94
00:07:53,028 --> 00:07:56,123
In my spare time, I read to the blind.

95
00:07:56,437 --> 00:07:59,699
And I'm also a mento for kids.

96
00:08:00,578 --> 00:08:03,947
- A mento?
- You know, a mento. A role model.

97
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,926
- A mento?
- Right.

98
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:12,682
- Like the candy?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

99
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:20,816
Our readers always want to know how
soap stars stay in such great shape.

100
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,466
Do you have a fitness regime?

101
00:08:23,714 --> 00:08:28,471
We stars usually just try to eat right
and get lots of exercise.

102
00:08:29,106 --> 00:08:33,448
You know we've thrown this
without dropping it for an hour?

103
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:34,909
Are you serious?

104
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,273
I realized it a half-hour ago,
but I didn't want to jinx it.

105
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:44,099
- Wow, we are pretty good at this.
- Yeah.

106
00:08:44,345 --> 00:08:47,157
Hey, we totally forgot about lunch.

107
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:49,103
That's the first time
I've ever missed a meal.

108
00:08:49,182 --> 00:08:52,064
My pants are a little loose.

109
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,623
What's wrong with you?

110
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,806
I got this blinding pain in my stomach
when I was lifting weights.

111
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:04,722
And then I passed out.

112
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:10,148
I haven't been able to stand up since.
But I don't think it's serious.

113
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:13,773
Sounds like a hernia.
Go to the doctor.

114
00:09:14,092 --> 00:09:15,301
No way!

115
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:21,189
If I go to the doctor, it's for this
thing sticking out of my stomach!

116
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:26,572
Why'd I have to start
working out again?

117
00:09:26,861 --> 00:09:29,434
Damn you, fifteens!

118
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,597
- What is it?
- A trifle. It has layers.

119
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,177
A layer of ladyfingers,
then a layer of jam.

120
00:09:36,463 --> 00:09:39,618
Then custard,
which I made from scratch.

121
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:44,699
Raspberries, more ladyfingers,
beef sautéed with peas and onions.

122
00:09:44,953 --> 00:09:47,799
Then a little bit more custard.

123
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:50,969
It tastes like feet.

124
00:09:52,955 --> 00:09:55,315
I like it.

125
00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:02,102
- Are you kidding?
- What's not to like? Custard, good.

126
00:10:02,383 --> 00:10:05,337
Jam, good. Meat, good!

127
00:10:07,915 --> 00:10:10,762
Well, you don't look good, Joe.

128
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:15,878
Well, the fridge broke,
so I had to eat everything.

129
00:10:16,126 --> 00:10:18,723
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.

130
00:10:18,944 --> 00:10:21,577
Hey, what was in that brown jar?

131
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:24,749
- That's still in there?
- Not anymore.

132
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:27,774
This piece doesn't have floor on it.

133
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:31,631
- Stick to your side.
- Hey, come on, now.

134
00:10:42,428 --> 00:10:44,824
All right, what are we having?

135
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:54,144
I don't believe in these crazy diets.
Just everything in moderation.

136
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,129
Your muffins.

137
00:10:57,737 --> 00:11:00,275
I'll take those to go.

138
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,872
For the kids.

139
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,077
I know what I wanted to ask.

140
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:10,292
They killed you off years ago.
What happened there?

141
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,786
I said some stuff in an interview
I shouldn't have said.

142
00:11:16,106 --> 00:11:20,211
- But that is not gonna happen today.
- Understood.

143
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:24,381
- So, what'd you say back then?
- I said that I...

144
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:27,548
- Hey, Joey!
- How you doing?

145
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:34,535
This is Shelly. She's interviewing me.
Shelly, these are my friends.

146
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,901
Hi, I'm gal pal Rachel Green.
If you want the dirt, come to me.

147
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:43,968
This might be Joey's baby, who knows?

148
00:11:44,462 --> 00:11:48,733
I'm just kidding.
Seriously, gal pal Rachel Green.

149
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,148
Who just lost the respect
of her unborn child.

150
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:56,143
I'm gonna go get this warmed up.

151
00:11:57,022 --> 00:12:00,391
- You're doing great.
- So far, nothing stupid.

152
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:02,622
- Mento?
- No, thanks.

153
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:09,856
As Joey's friends, is there anything
our readers should know?

154
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:13,057
No, just that he is a great guy.

155
00:12:13,304 --> 00:12:16,258
That'll get you
into Soap Opera Digest.

156
00:12:16,471 --> 00:12:17,894
Well, I...

157
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:20,253
I'd like to say that Joey...

158
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:25,157
...truly has enriched
the days of our lives.

159
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:30,172
I think that you don't expect
someone so hot to be so sweet.

160
00:12:30,457 --> 00:12:34,976
- I like that. What's your name?
- Phoebe Buffay.

161
00:12:35,223 --> 00:12:40,430
- How do you spell that?
- It's P as in Phoebe. H as in Heebie.

162
00:12:40,686 --> 00:12:42,904
O as in Obie. E as in Ebie.

163
00:12:43,156 --> 00:12:48,162
B as in Beebee.
And E as in, "'ello there, mate!"

164
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:51,218
Great. It was nice meeting you.

165
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:54,246
- Yeah, you too.
- Thanks.

166
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,539
It seems you have a lot of friends.
Who is your best friend?

167
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:05,834
How come you have two?

168
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,962
Well, this one's for you.

169
00:13:09,214 --> 00:13:12,025
- Get out!
- No, I can't.

170
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:18,535
I know how much this means to you.
This isn't just about jewelry.

171
00:13:18,748 --> 00:13:23,990
It's about you and me
and the fact that we're best buds.

172
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:29,036
Is this friendship? I think so!

173
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:32,170
Check it out! We're bracelet buddies!

174
00:13:32,455 --> 00:13:34,922
That's what they'll call us!

175
00:13:37,187 --> 00:13:41,006
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.

176
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:43,690
That's gonna leave a stain.

177
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:47,899
Rach, hey, it's fine.
You're at Joey's.

178
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,091
- Really?
- Yeah, look.

179
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:59,969
- I've never lived like this before.
- I know!

180
00:14:03,663 --> 00:14:07,626
Well, don't waste it.
I mean, it's still food. Jeez!

181
00:14:08,257 --> 00:14:11,352
I feel guilty.
I wanna be a good friend...

182
00:14:11,596 --> 00:14:16,318
...and damn it, I am a good friend.
So shut up and close your eyes.

183
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:23,587
You are a good friend.

184
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:27,628
The audition was this morning,
and I didn't get it.

185
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:33,608
But that was a hell of a kiss.
Rachel is a very lucky girl.

186
00:14:35,951 --> 00:14:40,222
Let's get the contestants
out of their isolation booths.

187
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:42,277
And they're off!

188
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,793
Get your foot off my contestant!
Judge!

189
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,614
Judge rules: No violation.

190
00:14:49,206 --> 00:14:54,556
- The duck gets the Nutter Butter!
- No! That's just an old won ton.

191
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:58,423
Judge rules: Nutter Butter!

192
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:00,886
Tough call.

193
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:07,079
- I saw it on the Discovery Channel.
- Wait a minute. I saw that!

194
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:10,286
Yeah, about jellyfish,
and how if you...

195
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:17,274
You peed on yourself?

196
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,971
You can't say that! You don't know!

197
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:25,283
I thought I'd pass out from the pain.

198
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:30,012
Anyway, I tried,
but I couldn't bend that way.

199
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:34,393
So...

200
00:15:40,037 --> 00:15:43,263
That's right, I stepped up!

201
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:48,490
She's my friend and she needed help!

202
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:52,341
If I had to,
I'd pee on any one of you!

203
00:15:56,076 --> 00:15:58,614
Nope. No best friend.

204
00:15:58,859 --> 00:16:01,776
Just a lot of close friends.

205
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:05,294
So now back to the show.

206
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:09,703
How does it feel
to have a huge gay fan base?

207
00:16:09,957 --> 00:16:12,069
Really? Me?

208
00:16:12,393 --> 00:16:16,557
Wow, I don't even know
any huge gay people.

209
00:16:16,846 --> 00:16:20,393
It hurts me. It physically hurts me.

210
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:25,152
Now, off the record, you're not...

211
00:16:25,788 --> 00:16:29,465
What? Are you referring
to my man's bag?

212
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:33,681
At first, it just looked good,
but it's practical.

213
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:38,033
It's got compartments for stuff:
Your wallet, your keys.

214
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:40,425
Your makeup.

215
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:45,232
Should I climb down your front
so we're face to face...

216
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,009
...or should I climb down your back
so we're butt to face?

217
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:53,965
- I think face is best.
- Yeah, face.

218
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:58,382
- Okay, here I come.
- All right.

219
00:17:00,997 --> 00:17:04,638
Oh, my...
How much do you weigh, Ross?

220
00:17:04,963 --> 00:17:10,135
I prefer not to answer that. I'm still
carrying a little holiday weight.

221
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:23,362
When we said "face to face," we didn't
think it all the way through!

222
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:25,592
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

223
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,045
Check it out.

224
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:37,764
How much of a man am I?

225
00:17:38,085 --> 00:17:42,533
Nice. Manly and also kind of a slut.

226
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:45,139
You're turning into a woman.

227
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,712
No, I'm not! Why would you say that?
That's just mean!

228
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:54,671
Now I've upset you? What did I say?

229
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:58,708
Not what you said,
it's just the way you said it.

230
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:02,019
Oh, my God! I'm a woman!

231
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:14,439
- Great nap.
- It really was.

232
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,159
Me? Gay? No. No. No.

233
00:18:30,516 --> 00:18:33,956
But I have a number
of close friends who are.

234
00:18:36,605 --> 00:18:38,514
So let's talk about women.

235
00:18:38,797 --> 00:18:42,651
I'm sure our female readers are
interested in your romantic life.

236
00:18:42,902 --> 00:18:46,650
What I do is, I look a woman
up and down and I say:

237
00:18:46,868 --> 00:18:50,581
"Hey. How you doing?"

238
00:18:52,678 --> 00:18:54,267
Oh, please.

239
00:18:54,557 --> 00:18:57,475
Hey. How you doing?

240
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:04,707
Hey. How you doing?

241
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,878
He has an amazing Porsche under there.

242
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,679
I'd love to show you, but I just
tucked her in. She's sleeping.

243
00:19:12,928 --> 00:19:16,297
Would you two girls
like to go for a drink?

244
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,553
- Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
- Oh, my God! Jill!

245
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,852
- Oh, my God! Rachel!
- Oh, hi!

246
00:19:28,096 --> 00:19:32,295
- Oh, my God! Introduce us!
- Well, this is Chandler.

247
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:36,404
You know Monica and Ross.
That's Phoebe. That's Joey.

248
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:39,846
- Hey, how you doing?
- Don't!

249
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:47,507
You're a really nice guy. I'm happy
to be your roommate and friend.

250
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:52,866
I'm just... You know, I just
don't feel that way about you.

251
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:57,772
I see what happened.

252
00:19:58,017 --> 00:20:01,564
It's because I was trying
to repel you. Right?

253
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:07,231
Believe me, you'd feel
a lot different if I turned it on.

254
00:20:07,446 --> 00:20:10,328
- I don't think so.
- Oh, I do.

255
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,636
How you doing?

256
00:20:16,596 --> 00:20:18,506
I'm okay.

257
00:20:18,892 --> 00:20:21,846
What? Oh, dear God!

258
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:29,360
Not much to tell there.
I'm really shy.

259
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,714
So that's it.
I guess that's all I need.

260
00:20:34,931 --> 00:20:39,059
Thank you so much.
I think they'll run this next month.

261
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:42,339
Oh, great. Great. Thank you.

262
00:20:42,585 --> 00:20:45,016
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

263
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,488
- I did it.
- Amazing.

264
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:52,942
Wait, I almost forgot.
We have to ask everybody this:

265
00:20:53,196 --> 00:20:56,636
Other than Days,
what's your favorite soap opera?

266
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:02,650
Oh, I don't watch soap operas.
Excuse me? I have a life, you know?

267
00:21:04,087 --> 00:21:08,986
The readers at Soap Opera Digest
will be happy to learn that.

268
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,860
Good enough.

269
00:21:14,628 --> 00:21:16,253
So close.

270
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:25,020
They didn't put in the part
about you not watching soaps.

271
00:21:25,274 --> 00:21:29,901
I called the lady and said I
was joking. She was nice about it.

272
00:21:30,146 --> 00:21:33,372
- You slept with her, didn't you?
- A little bit.

273
00:21:35,155 --> 00:21:37,551
This picture of you is steamy.

274
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:42,177
That's just a little something
for my huge gay fan base.

275
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:45,583
- Did you just wink at me?
- You're the one who loves the picture.
