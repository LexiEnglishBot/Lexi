1
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:09,298
I'll get candles and
my mom's lace tablecloth.

2
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,668
And since it's Rachel's birthday...

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,106
...I thought I'd poach a salmon.

4
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:15,811
What?

5
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,110
Question. Why do we always
have parties where you poach things?

6
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,820
You want to be on the food committee?

7
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:25,147
Question 2. Why do we always
have parties with committees?

8
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:29,458
Why can't we just get pizza
and beer and have fun?

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,723
I agree. Fancy parties are only fun
if you're fancy on the inside.

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,661
And I'm not sure we are.

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,365
You don't want it to be special?

12
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,266
Fine. You can throw
any kind of party you want.

13
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,340
Joey, they're not real!

14
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,541
I start miles beneath the surface
of these things. They're fake.

15
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,316
See?
Honk, honk!

16
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:55,980
Wow, it's like porno for clowns!

17
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:02,826
The One With Two Parties

18
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:47,602
Neither of Rachel's sisters can come.

19
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:51,275
I still have to invite Dylan
and Emma and Shannon Cooper.

20
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,673
No Shannon Cooper.

21
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:55,141
Why not her?

22
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,346
Because she...

23
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,244
She steals stuff.

24
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:05,690
Or maybe she doesn't and Joey slept
with her and never called her back.

25
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,252
Joey, that is horrible.

26
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,690
Hey, I liked her.

27
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,261
Maybe too much.

28
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,022
I don't know.

29
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,529
I guess I just got scared.

30
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,501
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

31
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,236
I didn't think anyone
would buy that. Okay!

32
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,176
Hi, honey.
How did it go?

33
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,312
It was the graduation from hell.

34
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,778
My cousin went to hell
on a football scholarship.

35
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:35,016
It's supposed to be a joyous occasion.

36
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,347
My sister would graduate from college.
Nobody thought she would.

37
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:42,817
It's a testament to what a girl
from Long Island will do for a Celica.

38
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,794
What happened?

39
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,157
My parents happened.

40
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,368
All they had to do was sit
in the same stadium, smile...

41
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,764
...and not talk about the divorce.
But no!

42
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,564
They got into a fight
during the commencement address.

43
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:59,834
Bishop Tutu actually
had to stop and shush them.

44
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,512
You know the good news?

45
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,378
I get to serve coffee
for the next eight hours.

46
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,785
I guess we don't invite her parents.

47
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,390
- How about just her mom?
- Why her mom?

48
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,758
Because I already invited her.

49
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,330
Did you ask Stacy Roth?

50
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:19,826
Can't invite her.

51
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,099
She also steals.

52
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,109
So does her roomate.

53
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,383
Here are the candles.
Where's the birthday cake?

54
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,518
We're not having birthday cake.

55
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,517
We're having birthday flan.

56
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,825
Excuse me?

57
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,961
It's a traditional
Mexican custard dessert.

58
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,561
That's nice.

59
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,527
Happy birthday, Rachel.
Here's some goo!

60
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,705
Dr. Greene!

61
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,006
Oh, my God!
It's Rachel's dad.

62
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:08,942
Why are you here?

63
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,877
The father can't see
the daughter on her birthday?

64
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,881
No, no, the father can.

65
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,884
But since I am the roommate,
I can tell you she's not here.

66
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,183
And I'll pass along the message.
Okay? So bye-bye.

67
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,323
You're having a party.

68
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,265
No, no, not a party.

69
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,626
Just a surprise gathering
of some people Rachel knows.

70
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:33,565
- This is Phoebe, Chandler and Joey.
- I'll never remember all that.

71
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,131
So what's the deal?

72
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:40,037
Rachel comes home, people pop out
and yell stuff? Is that it?

73
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,714
This isn't your first
surprise party, is it, sir?

74
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,120
Hi, Monica.

75
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:54,124
The Chinese menu guy.
Forgot the menus.

76
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,055
So basically, just a Chinese guy.

77
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,962
Dr. Greene, come with me.
We'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.

78
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,606
All right.
That sounds like a two-person job.

79
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,442
Well, my goodness!
What was that?

80
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:18,275
Sandra, I thought you were Rachel.
We weren't ready for you yet.

81
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:22,249
- You thought I was Rachel?
- Yes, because you look so young.

82
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,047
And because you're both,
you know, white women.

83
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,957
Oh, I missed you kids.
Should I put my coat in the bedroom?

84
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,594
- No, I'll take that for you.
- Oh, well, thank you.

85
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,100
Such a gentleman.
Thank you.

86
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:46,975
It all looks so nice.
So festive. All the balloons.

87
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,482
Oh, the funniest thing happened
to me on the way here.

88
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,252
- I was driving
- That's great!

89
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,822
I can't wait to hear the rest,
but I have to go to the bathroom.

90
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,754
Hey, come with me.

91
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,491
- What?
- It will be like we're gal pals.

92
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,528
You know, like at a restaurant.
It'll be fun! Come on.

93
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,337
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

94
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,076
Think. Think.

95
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,505
What would Jack and Chrissy do?

96
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,815
Okay, now that your coat
is safely in the bed

97
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,383
We can come back out
in the living room.

98
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:32,954
Joey and Chandler, it's time
you take Dr. Greene over to your place.

99
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,023
Yes, absolutely.

100
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,292
Why, again?

101
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,199
Because that's where
the party is, you goon!

102
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:46,769
- See, this is just the staging area.
- Right, it's the staging area.

103
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,008
This is clearly
in the wrong apartment.

104
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:58,706
All right, you guys are off
to party number one.

105
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,813
And you...

106
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,488
You are off to party number two.

107
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:08,218
All right, let's keep it moving,
let's keep it moving.

108
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,997
At least send some women to my party.

109
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,268
Okay, that's Ross. All right.

110
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,770
Okay, they're coming.

111
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,277
Thank you for such a wonderful dinner.

112
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,679
Thanks for being born.

113
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,977
Thank you for my beautiful earrings.
They're perfect.

114
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,347
I love you.

115
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:40,283
Now, you can exchange them
if you want, okay?

116
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,085
Now I love you even more.

117
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,566
Surprise!

118
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:51,903
Oh, my gosh!

119
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,001
Wow!

120
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,900
Oh, my God. Mom!

121
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,404
This is so great!

122
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,812
Happy birthday, sweetie.

123
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:04,007
You! I had no idea!

124
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,410
- Really?
- No, I knew.

125
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,811
All right.

126
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,218
There's food and drinks on the table.

127
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,083
Go across the hall.
Right now, Joey and Chandler's.

128
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,587
- Why?
- Just go.

129
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,228
Weird.

130
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,430
Surprise!

131
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,262
Happy birthday, sweet pea.

132
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,596
Daddy!

133
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,515
Both of them are here? Both of them?
Both of them are here?

134
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,115
Well, we could count again?

135
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,184
I can't believe this!

136
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,911
You know, this is ridiculous.

137
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,453
This is your birthday, your party.

138
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,855
Let's put them together.
If they can't deal with it, who cares?

139
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,087
- I do.
- That's who.

140
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,397
Are you gonna be okay?

141
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:59,435
I don't really have a choice.
I can look at the bright side.

142
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,538
I get two birthday parties
and two birthday cakes.

143
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,002
Well, actually...

144
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,669
...just one birthday flan.

145
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,544
It's a traditional
Mexican custard dessert.

146
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,343
Talk to Monica.
She's on the food committee.

147
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,719
Some girl just walked up to me
and said, "I want you, Dennis"...

148
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,432
...and stuck her tongue
down my throat.

149
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,095
I love this party!

150
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,362
- Quick volleyball question.
- Volleyball.

151
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,607
We set up a court in your room.

152
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,275
You didn't like
that gray lamp, did you?

153
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:43,609
A woman stuck her tongue down my
throat. I'm not even listening to you.

154
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,745
- Dennis!
- Okay, that's me.

155
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,122
Can you keep Dad occupied?
I'm gonna talk to Mom for a while.

156
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,859
Do you have any ideas
for any openers?

157
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,753
Stay clear of "I'm the guy
that's doing your daughter"...

158
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,066
...and you should be okay.

159
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,270
I want you to take a piece of paper

160
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:09,440
Here you go. And write down
your most embarrassing memory.

161
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:14,446
When you're not using the markers,
put the caps back on them...

162
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,705
...because they will dry out.

163
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,048
Hi, Dr. Greene.

164
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,118
So how's everything in the...

165
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,790
...vascular surgery...

166
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,121
...game?

167
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,895
It's not a game, Ross.
A woman died on my table today.

168
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:33,759
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:38,029
That's the good thing about my job.

170
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,535
All the dinosaurs on my table
are already dead.

171
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,804
Listen, I don't mean
to be a pain about this...

172
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:50,140
...but I've noticed some of you
are just placing them on.

173
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,180
You want to push the caps...

174
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,144
...until you hear them click.

175
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,786
Gunther!

176
00:10:59,025 --> 00:10:59,957
Where you going?

177
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,820
I was sort of thinking about maybe

178
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,064
No! No, you can't go!
No, this is fun.

179
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,867
We're just starting.
Here's your marker.

180
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,867
If you want to go, just go.

181
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,039
She'll yell at me again.

182
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,243
All right, I can get you out.

183
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,504
What?

184
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,685
In a minute, I'll create a diversion.

185
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,616
When I do, walk quickly to the door
and don't look back.

186
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,627
- I think I need a drink.
- I'll get it for you.

187
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,829
- What do you want?
- Scotch.

188
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:42,431
I'll be back in 10 seconds with
your scotch on the rocks in a glass.

189
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:43,564
Neat!

190
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,202
Cool.

191
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,103
Neat, as in no rocks.

192
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:50,873
I know.

193
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:58,247
Hello, Ross!
Where have you been?

194
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,817
I have been in the bathroom.

195
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,322
Stay clear of the salmon mousse.

196
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,489
Scotch neat.

197
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,989
That's Rachel's father's drink.

198
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,502
Mine too. Isn't that neat?

199
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,032
Scotch neat.

200
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,768
Would you excuse me?

201
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,512
Where are you sneaking off to, mister?

202
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,146
I'm getting my cigarettes.

203
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,287
No.

204
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:39,855
What do you mean "no"?

205
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,789
See, because that's the staging area.

206
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,587
You go in there, it'll ruin
the whole illusion of the party.

207
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,791
Take your scotch back in there...

208
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,368
...and I will get
your cigarettes for you, sir.

209
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,799
- Get my glasses too.
- All righty-roo.

210
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,540
What a great moment to say that
for the first time.

211
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:11,186
Okay, the first person's
most embarrassing memory is...

212
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,448
..."Monica, your party sucks."

213
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,889
Very funny.

214
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,860
Oh, no! Did someone forget
to use a coaster?

215
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,259
What?

216
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,907
I don't see anything.

217
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,370
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.

218
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,747
Ross, whose glasses are those?

219
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:40,707
Mine.

220
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,022
You wear bifocals?

221
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,150
I have a condition apparently...

222
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,259
...that I require...

223
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,063
...two different sets of focals.

224
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:59,502
Do you know my husband
has glasses just like that?

225
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,400
Well, those are very popular frames.

226
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,733
Neil Sedaka wears them.

227
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,214
I hear you can get people out of here.

228
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,483
You didn't tell me
your boyfriend smokes.

229
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,121
Yeah, like a chimney.

230
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,052
Big smoker.

231
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,425
Big, big smoker.

232
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:29,666
In fact, I'm gonna go into the hallway
and fire up this bad boy.

233
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,982
Are you wearing my glasses?

234
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,484
Yes.

235
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:54,023
I was just warming up
the earpieces for you.

236
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:55,926
Thank you.

237
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,498
Is that one of my cigarettes?

238
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,974
Yes, it is. I was just
moistening the tip.

239
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:16,312
She's taking the trash out,
so I can get you out of here.

240
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,879
But it has to be now.
She'll be back any minute.

241
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,048
What about my friend?

242
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,777
Only the three of you.
Any more and she'll get suspicious.

243
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,581
- Let me just get my coat.
- There isn't time!

244
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,527
Just leave everything.

245
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,294
They'll take care of you next door.

246
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,730
Is it true they have beer?

247
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,334
Everything you've heard is true.

248
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,571
Could you guys please keep it down?

249
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,572
We're trying to start
a Boggle tournament.

250
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:50,547
True, if these people find out a funny game,
then will be no people left in our party.

251
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,184
You!

252
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,513
And you.

253
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,689
You're supposed to be at my party.

254
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,756
And Gunther!

255
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,025
What are you doing here?

256
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,632
Welcome to the fo

257
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:21,745
All right, I'm sorry.
But these people needed me.

258
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,211
They work hard all week.
It's Saturday night.

259
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,611
They deserve to have a little fun.
Go!

260
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,615
You know, my party is fun.

261
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,515
It's a little quieter,
less obvious sort of fun.

262
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,851
But if people would just
give it a chance, it's

263
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,727
- You want me to see a therapist?
- Sweetheart, you have a problem.

264
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,599
You've chosen a boyfriend
exactly like your father.

265
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,805
Okay, Mom, I'll make an appointment.

266
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:55,272
But right now, I gotta go.
I gotta go do a thing.

267
00:16:55,547 --> 00:17:00,348
Did you know your mother
spent $1200 on bonsai trees?

268
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,447
I felt like Gulliver.

269
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,319
Daddy, I really want
to hear more about this...

270
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:09,752
...but I just have to do some stuff.

271
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,964
You work and you work
and you work at a marriage...

272
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,598
...but all he cares about
is his stupid boat.

273
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,630
You work and you work
and you work on a boat.

274
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,804
He always ridiculed my pottery classes.

275
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,974
And you sand it and varnish it.

276
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,804
But when all is said and done,
he still drinks out of the mugs.

277
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,981
One night of her yoga
and Bridges of Madison County...

278
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,012
- The scotch, the cigarettes...
- The bonsais and the Chihuahua...

279
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,514
I may have only been in therapy
for three weeks now but

280
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,289
What the hell does she want
with half a boat?

281
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,653
Okay, okay, you can be shirts
and I'll be skins.

282
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,496
I'll be skins!

283
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,503
How you holding up there, big tiger?

284
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,045
Sorry. When my parents were getting
divorced, I got a lot of "tigers."

285
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,351
I got a lot of "champs,"
"chiefs," "sports."

286
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,846
I even got a "governor."

287
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,791
This is it, isn't it?
This is what my life will be like.

288
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,219
My mom there, my dad there.

289
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,065
Thanksgiving, Christmas.

290
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:25,861
She gets the house, he's in a condo
my sister will decorate with wicker.

291
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,899
How did you get through this?

292
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:34,044
I relied on a carefully
regimented program...

293
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,780
...of denial...

294
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,545
...and wetting the bed.

295
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,717
You know, I just
It's so weird.

296
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:48,652
I mean, I was in there just listening
to them bitch about each other.

297
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,657
All I kept thinking about
was the Fourth of July.

298
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,266
Because it reminded you of the way...

299
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,129
...our forefathers used
to bitch at each other?

300
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,698
It's just this thing.
Every year we would...

301
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,703
...go out on my dad's boat
and watch the fireworks.

302
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,269
Mom always hated it because
the ocean air made her hair all big.

303
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,608
My sister Jill would be
throwing up over the side...

304
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,612
...and Dad would be upset
because nobody helping.

305
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:19,014
And when we did help, he'd scream
at us for doing it wrong.

306
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:26,424
But then when the fireworks started,
everybody just shut up.

307
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,262
You know, and it'd get really cold.

308
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:33,129
And we'd all just sort of
smoosh under this one blanket.

309
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,498
It never occurred to anybody
to bring another one.

310
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,709
And now it's...

311
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:44,779
Yeah, I know.

312
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,141
Thanks for coming.
I hope you had fun.

313
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,543
All right, I'm hitting the road.

314
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,711
Now, I've left my 10 verbs
on the table.

315
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,143
Be sure and send me
that finished poem.

316
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,280
Okay, will do. Glad you came.

317
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:23,644
- I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
- Let me go check.

318
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,325
Your mom wants to say goodbye.

319
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,560
Happy birthday, sweetie.

320
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:34,799
You drive safe.

321
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:37,999
What are you doing?

322
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,737
I'm getting ready
for the water skiing.

323
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,236
Okay, big hug. One more.
Come on!

324
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,371
How are you?

325
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,750
- Where are you going?
- To get my coat.

326
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,383
We'll get that for you.

327
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,656
All right, all right.
I can get my own coat.

328
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,025
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.

329
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:14,499
Oh, no. No, you're not
supposed to be here.

330
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:18,071
This is the staging area.
It's all wrong. You should leave.

331
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,108
You know, just get out.

332
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,250
Or perhaps you'd like
a creme de menthe.

333
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:35,917
I have to be heading
toward my chateau.

334
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,991
I guess we're going back
into the hallway again.

335
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,266
Thanks for coming, Mrs. Greene.

336
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:55,545
You take care.

337
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,675
Oh, you kids.

338
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:04,418
Well.

339
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:09,251
This is the best party
I've been to in years.

340
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,387
Thank you!

341
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,429
Okay, everybody,
it's time for flan!

342
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:23,003
Yep! Get ready
for the gelatinous fun.

343
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:27,375
Looks like that stuff you get
when you get an infection.

344
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,374
Okay, that's enough.

345
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,343
Okay, Rachel,
make a special flan wish.

346
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,243
Okay, I've got one.

347
