1
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,464
- Okay.
- Aah.

2
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:12,261
Listen, I'm gonna be moving out, so you
are gonna be in charge of paying the rent.

3
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,513
- Right, and when is that due?
- First of the month.

4
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,223
And that's every month?

5
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:19,101
No, just the months
you actually want to live here.

6
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,519
Ah.

7
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,896
Okay, here's the phone bill.

8
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,899
Oh, my God!

9
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,527
That's our phone number.

10
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:33,407
Look, I know I kind of sprung this whole
me-moving-out-on-you thing.

11
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,994
- So why don't I just cover you for a while?
- No, no. No way.

12
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,831
Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...

13
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,624
...anymore.

14
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,961
- It's not charity, Joe.
- No, forget it.

15
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,672
Okay? I mean, thanks, but I'm done
taking money from you.

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,383
All right? I can take care of myself.
Now, what's next? Come on.

17
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,594
Okay, uh, here's the electric bill.

18
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,472
- This is how much we pay for electric?
- Well, yeah.

19
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,937
So we'll do the rest
of the bills later, then?

20
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,687
So is Joey gonna have to give up
the apartment?

21
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,565
I hope not. I tried to offer him money,
but he wouldn't take it.

22
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,192
How much do you think he needs?

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,070
I figure $1500 would cover him
for a few months, you know...

24
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,240
...but I have to trick him into
taking it so I don't hurt his pride.

25
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,159
Yeah. Well, why don't you hire him
as an actor?

26
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:04,456
You could have him dress up
and put on little skits whenever you want.

27
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,877
Well, that would help the pride thing.

28
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,380
- Hey.
- Hey.

29
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,591
Wow, you look great.
Do you wanna move in with me tomorrow?

30
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,636
- Okay.
- Okay.

31
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,472
What do you girls
have planned for tonight?

32
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,392
Instead of being sad
that tonight's my last night with Rachel...

33
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,394
...we thought we'd go out and celebrate:

34
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,229
Rachel's moving in with Phoebe.

35
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,607
- And also my birthday. Ha, ha.
- It's not your birthday.

36
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,860
What a mean thing to say.

37
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:36,155
I would never tell you
it was not your birthday.

38
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,407
- Hey.
- Hey.

39
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:42,035
Hey, so you guys have anything planned
for the big last night?

40
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,956
Well, instead of just hanging out,
we figure we'd do nothing.

41
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,459
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Knicks' season opener tonight.

42
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,129
I thought maybe you guys
would come and watch it.

43
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,839
I don't know, Ross.

44
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,258
Not if you talk about
how you gave up basketball...

45
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,885
...to become a paleontologist.

46
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:02,639
I did give up a career in basketball
to become a paleontologist.

47
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,642
- Pheebs, I was wondering...
- You're not dressed yet?

48
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,604
We're supposed to start having fun
in 15 minutes!

49
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:12,608
Well, and clearly, not a minute sooner.

50
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,945
Rachel, you are packed, though, right?
I mean, please tell me you're packed.

51
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:20,449
Of course I'm packed. Monica, relax.

52
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,076
I wanted to ask Phoebe for her opinion
on what I should wear.

53
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,829
My God, I cannot get a minute of peace.

54
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,668
Oh, my God.

55
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,756
Monica's just gonna kill you.

56
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,132
I know.

57
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,468
What you're wearing is fine for that.

58
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,849
You're not packed!

59
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,435
You're not packed even a little bit.

60
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,812
Surprise.

61
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,983
Don't get mad,
because, look, this is what happened.

62
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:59,029
So I started packing, and then I realized,
"What am I doing?"

63
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,074
I am lousy at packing, right?

64
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,825
But you love packing.

65
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:08,038
So as a gift to you on our last night...

66
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,249
Ta-da.

67
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,503
I'll be coordinator.

68
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,838
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I didn't get you anything.

69
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,173
Oh.

70
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,176
Look, everybody has to help.
Phoebe, you can help, can't you?

71
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,719
I have plans.

72
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,639
- You have plans with us.
- That's right.

73
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,269
All right. Chandler can make boxes,
Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things.

74
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,396
- Tell the guys they have to help out.
- Okay.

75
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,856
- Okay.
- My God, thank you.

76
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,860
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack.
She's got jobs for everyone.

77
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,697
Now, it's too late for me,
but save yourselves.

78
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,032
Okay.

79
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,577
The movers will be here in 11 hours.
Rachel has not packed.

80
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,705
Now, everybody has to help. Chandler...

81
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,374
No, I have plans with Joey.

82
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:56,545
- I thought you said you were doing nothing.
- Yes, but for the last time.

83
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,798
Okay, fine. Now, Ross...

84
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,384
- Oh, but I can't do it.
- Why not?

85
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:06,179
- Don't you have Ben?
- Because I have Ben.

86
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,766
It's almost 8:00, it's almost past
his bedtime. Where is he?

87
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,393
He's at a dinner party.

88
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,565
Is he really coming?
Because I can see into your apartment.

89
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,151
Of course he is. Uh, what?

90
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,737
You think I'd just use my son
as an excuse?

91
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,364
What kind of father do you think I am?

92
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,116
All right. Sorry.

93
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,661
I gotta go make a fake Ben.

94
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,711
Here it is.
Our last pizzas together as roommates.

95
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,380
I wish I'd known you were gonna do that.
I ordered Chinese.

96
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,882
Oh. Oh, that's okay.

97
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,926
Hey, actually, in a way it's kind of nice.
You know?

98
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:49,222
Our last dinner together. Me,
bringing the food of my ancestors...

99
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,475
...you, the food of yours.

100
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,604
Huh?

101
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,107
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea
for what to do on our last night.

102
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:02,110
What do you say we play a little,
uh, foosball for money?

103
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:06,365
Are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once
since my injury-plagued '97 season.

104
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,533
It'd be easier if you'd
just give me your money.

105
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,118
Yes, it would.

106
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,330
Ahem. What do you say to $50?

107
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,624
- Okay, you're on.
- Okay, let's play.

108
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,918
The big game. Italy versus...

109
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,544
...China, apparently.

110
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,801
Oh, look, it's the Rollerblades.

111
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,928
Oh, God.

112
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,639
You remember when we got these?

113
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,849
No.

114
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,602
Oh, I guess you weren't there.

115
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,232
You guys,
we said we were gonna have fun.

116
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,235
Come on. Hey, ha, ha,
remember the time?

117
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,991
You don't remember?

118
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,496
Sorry, Pheebs.
I guess I'm just really sad that I'm leaving.

119
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,623
I'm gonna miss you so much.

120
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,293
Well, this doesn't have to be so sad
though, you know?

121
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,422
Instead of thinking about how much
you're gonna miss about each other...

122
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,925
...you should, like, think about
some of the things you're not gonna miss.

123
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,345
I don't think there's anything.

124
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,556
Come on, there's gotta be something.

125
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,308
Nope. She's perfect.

126
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,188
I have one.

127
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,775
Good. Great. Okay, you can go first.

128
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,403
Uh, well, I guess
I'm not gonna miss the fact...

129
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:30,574
...that you're never allowed
to move the phone pen. Ha, ha.

130
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,538
That's a good one.
Okay, Monica, anything?

131
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,291
You know,
does Rachel move the phone pen?

132
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,627
- Aw, sometimes.
- Ha, ha.

133
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,713
Always, actually.

134
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,925
Good. There you go.
Doesn't everyone feel better?

135
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,554
It's not just the phone pen.

136
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,724
It's just that I never get my messages.

137
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,559
You get your messages.

138
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,229
Well, I don't think it counts
if you have to read them off your hand...

139
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,065
...after you've fallen asleep
on the couch.

140
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,902
So you missed a message from who?
Chandler?

141
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,737
Or your mom?

142
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,614
Or Chandler?

143
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,073
Or your mom?

144
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,955
Great, it worked. No one's sad. Heh.

145
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,125
- Yes.
- Ah.

146
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:26,254
I win again. Ha, ha, that's, like,
500 bucks you owe me. Woo-hoo!

147
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,465
Man. Five hundred dollars.

148
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:33,178
That is a lot of electricity, huh?
Woo-hoo!

149
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,680
Ooh, I gotta buy some food.

150
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,892
Okay, okay. Give me a chance
to win my money back. Sudden death...

151
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,728
...one goal, $1000.

152
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,772
- You serious?
- Oh, yes.

153
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,440
Okay.

154
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,484
- Get ready to owe me.
- Okay.

155
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,944
Okay, here we go. Ready?

156
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,470
- No, no, no!
- No, no, no!

157
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,974
No one can beat me.

158
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,565
See, now that's why only the little fake men
are supposed to do the kicking.

159
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,654
Hello?

160
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,657
Oh, hi, Ross. See, other people call me.

161
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,577
Ooh, your brother. Score.

162
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,914
- What's up?
- I'm here with Ben.

163
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,749
Thought we'd say hi.

164
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,753
- Put him on.
- Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.

165
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,008
Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like
talking right now.

166
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:56,678
Uh, he's smiling, though.

167
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,015
Okay, talk to you later.

168
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,316
I think it was better
when you guys were sad.

169
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,986
Hey, oh, remember the Rollerblades? Oh.

170
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,324
You know what else I'm not gonna miss?
"I'm Monica.

171
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,869
I wash the toilets 17 times a day,
even if people are on it."

172
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,956
"Hi, I'm Rachel.
Is my sweater too tight? No?

173
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,542
Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it."

174
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,963
"I'm Monica. I don't get phone messages
from interesting people. Ever."

175
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,632
Hey, I call her.

176
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:40,388
"Oh, my God. I love Ross.
I hate Ross. I love Ross. I hate Ross."

177
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,099
"Oh, my God.
I can't find a boyfriend.

178
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:47,520
So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall
and sleep with the first guy I find in there."

179
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:57,405
Yeah, we should get a move on if we want
to make those dinner reservations.

180
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,747
Still broken?

181
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,041
It sucks, man.

182
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,044
Your last night here, and I lose the two
most important things:

183
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,505
The foosball table...

184
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,507
...and $500.

185
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,386
Well, you know, there are other ways
you can win back your money.

186
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,180
- How about blackjack?
- Ah, not my game.

187
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,808
Okay, uh, you know what?
We can play a new game.

188
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,352
- A new game. It's fun.
- What's it called?

189
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,230
Cups.

190
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,235
- I don't know how to play Cups.
- I'll teach you. It's really easy and fun.

191
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,529
- All right.
- Okay, here you go.

192
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,782
I have two queens.
What do you have?

193
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,535
- A two and a five.
- Whoa, you win. Fifty dollars.

194
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,790
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. Okay, let's play again. Ready?

195
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,166
Ooh!

196
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,295
- What have you got?
- A four and a nine.

197
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,464
You're kidding, right?

198
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,343
- No. Why?
- Well, that's a full cup.

199
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,556
Damn, I am good at Cups.

200
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,268
I'm not talking to her.

201
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,353
One of you has to take the first step...

202
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,897
...and it should be you because
she's the one who's leaving.

203
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,774
It's harder for her.

204
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,235
Maybe you're right.

205
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,946
But she made fun of my phone pen.

206
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,866
I know. I took it hard too.

207
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,997
Listen, Rachel,
I feel bad about what happened...

208
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,666
- What are you doing?
- I'm unpacking.

209
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,795
- What?
- I'm not moving. Is that picture straight?

210
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,798
It needs to go about 20 blocks
to the left.

211
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,133
Hey, you know what?

212
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,178
You're the one who wants this
big change and move in with Chandler.

213
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,305
You should go.
Why do I have to leave?

214
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:49,225
- Because It's my apartment!
- Well, it's mine too. What else you got?

215
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,103
How about: You're moving!

216
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,857
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.

217
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,487
Okay, Monica...

218
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,282
This is ridiculous.

219
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,869
We should be packing you.

220
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,874
- Hey, how you guys doing?
- Great. Monica's moving.

221
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,460
I am not!

222
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,671
Oh, really? Well, how come
all your stuff is in this box?

223
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,258
Okay, you guys, you guys,
I think I know what's going on here.

224
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,053
Okay? You guys? Stop!

225
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:30,433
I know that you're acting mad because
you think that will make it easier to leave.

226
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,686
But deep down, you're still really sad.
Deep, deep down.

227
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,105
- No, Phoebe, I am mad!
- Well, deep, deep, deep down.

228
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,732
Yeah, I'm just mad.

229
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,692
Then keep running.

230
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,197
You win.

231
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,991
- What did you have?
- Doesn't matter. Nothing beats...

232
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,494
...a three and a six.

233
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,871
That, my friend, is "D Cup."

234
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,417
Okay, now,
how much have you won so far?

235
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,088
- Wow. Seven hundred.
- Not 700 exactly?

236
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,715
- Yeah.
- Heh. Double it.

237
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,928
- What?
- Yeah, see, in Cups, once you get $700...

238
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,221
...you have to double it.

239
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,933
- Really?
- Hey, I didn't make up the rules.

240
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:18,189
Okay, so now, after you receive
the doubling bonus, you get, uh, one card.

241
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:22,861
Now, that one card could be worth $100,
which brings your total to 1500.

242
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,362
- Ooh.
- No, no, no.

243
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,783
Don't get too excited, because that's not
gonna happen unless you get the... No way.

244
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,038
Well, this is the last box of your clothes.

245
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,166
I'm just gonna label it
"What were you thinking?"

246
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:42,213
Funny, I was just gonna go across
the hall and write that on Chandler.

247
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,927
Okay, you guys, I don't mean
to make things worse, but...

248
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,221
...I don't wanna live
with Rachel anymore.

249
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,974
- What?
- You're just so mean to each other.

250
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,436
And I don't wanna end up like that
with Rachel. I still like you.

251
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,647
Well, Phoebe, that's fine
because I'm not moving.

252
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,942
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Phoebe, you gotta take her.

253
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,403
You know, I know I said
some bad stuff...

254
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,740
...but Rachel does have some qualities
that make her a good roommate.

255
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,366
Oh, really? Like what, Monica?

256
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,955
You know how she has 147,000
pair of boots?

257
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,790
Oh, yeah, good start, Mon.

258
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,002
- She lets you borrow them.
- Yeah.

259
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,880
And you stretch them out
with your big old clown feet.

260
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,259
Do you wanna live outside?
Because it's getting cold.

261
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,304
She gets tons of catalogs...

262
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:35,016
...and, um, she'll fold down the pages
of the things she thinks I'd like.

263
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,852
- What else?
- Uh...

264
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,979
When I take a shower...

265
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,482
...she leaves me little notes
on the mirror.

266
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,901
Yeah, I do. I do do that.

267
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:49,155
That's nice. I like having things
to read in the bathroom.

268
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,826
When I fall asleep on the couch
after reading...

269
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,038
...she covers me over with a blanket.

270
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:01,167
Well, you know,
I don't want you to be cold.

271
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,507
And when I told her I was
gonna be moving in with Chandler...

272
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,343
...she was really supportive.

273
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,764
You were so great.

274
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,851
You made it so easy.

275
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,647
And now you have to leave.

276
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,525
And I have to live with a boy!

277
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,571
It's gonna be fine.

278
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,575
Okay, Rachel. Now I can't wait
to live with you.

279
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,202
You know what we should do?

280
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,746
Bring Monica, and then
we can all live there together.

281
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,415
We'll have so much fun!

282
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,293
But, honey, I think she's moving in
with Chandler.

283
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,004
Oh, that's right.

284
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,630
You're still set on that?

285
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,842
Kind of.

286
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,057
Oh, my God.

287
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,438
Hello? Hey, Mon.

288
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,815
How's the packing going?

289
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,736
Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right...
Oh, my God.

290
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:14,449
Get your head out of your shirt there,
son.

291
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,034
What?

292
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,328
Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.

293
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,708
Hey.

294
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,210
- What's wrong?
- Ross and I were helping the girls pack...

295
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:30,339
...took a little break.
I lost $1500 to him in Cups.

296
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:35,011
Wha...? How did you lose at Cups?

297
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,721
The same way you lost.

298
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:41,267
I started out with the king and the
queen. Bam. Ross gets a two and a three.

299
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:45,229
Then I get a jack and a king.
Boom. Ross gets a four and five.

300
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,649
Even Ross was getting the Cup card,
the D Cup...

301
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:54,572
...the sitting-down bonus. Meanwhile,
I didn't even get a half cup. Nothing.

302
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,948
Oh, man.

303
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,201
He never played before either.

304
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:02,288
You know what I think? I think
beginner's luck, very important in Cups.

305
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,792
Let's just play one more hand.
One more hand.

306
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:09,712
No, no more. I cannot lose another dime.
I'm serious this time.

307
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,299
In fact, look. There's...
I wanna give you something, okay?

308
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,302
And let me give it to you now
before I pawn it for Cups money.

309
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:22,183
Now, I want you to have
the big, white dog...

310
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:27,146
...as a... Kind of a thank-you for being
such a great roommate.

311
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,775
I can't take the big, white dog.
You love it.

312
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,402
It's "him." Not "it."

313
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,115
Well, what if I bought it from you,
you know?

314
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,451
And then your nice gesture would be
giving it to me at a reasonable price.

315
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,328
Say $1500?

316
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,917
Wait a second.
I see what you're trying to do here.

317
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,294
You're trying to give me money again.

318
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,463
When did I try to give you money?

319
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,465
Before, over there with the bills.

320
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,510
You tried to give me charity,
I said no, you dropped it.

321
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,804
Okay, then we had a nice
last night together.

322
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,558
We had some fun, we gambled, nobody
tried to give anybody any money.

323
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,563
Now, out of the blue,
you start with the charity thing again.

324
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,525
I'm just trying to help you out, okay?
I wanna make sure that you're okay.

325
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,819
I will be okay. Look, Chandler.

326
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,990
You gotta get it out of your head
that I can't take care of myself, okay?

327
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:23,452
Look, I'm not gonna miss you
helping me out with money.

328
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,080
The only thing I'm gonna miss...

329
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,082
...is you.

330
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,295
And now the dog.

331
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,595
Hey.

332
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,431
- Call me when you get there, okay?
- Okay.

333
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,391
I'm really gonna miss you.

334
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,442
Oh, I have your key.

335
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,029
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

336
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,663
Oh, God, this is silly.
I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours.

337
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,416
Bye, house.

338
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,048
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

339
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,656
Hey.

340
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,743
- She really left.
- I know.

341
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,666
- Thank you.
- No problem, roomie.

342
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,801
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

343
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,512
What the hell is that dog doing here?

344
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:12,311
I invented the game of Cups
as a way to give Joey money.

345
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,982
- And now you want that money back?
- Exactly.

346
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,526
Chandler, what kind of idiot
do you take me for?

347
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,904
It's not a real game. I made it up.

348
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,241
I'm sorry you lost your money.
But I won it fair and square.

349
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,118
At a fake game!

350
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,663
Now, if you wanna try
to make some of it back...

351
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:34,083
...I'd be glad to play you for it.
But I should warn you.

352
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,712
I am very good at Cups.

353
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:42,174
Okay, now, I assume the saucer card
came up when you played last?

354
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,302
- No.
- Hmm.

355
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,054
Let's see if it comes up this time.
