1
00:00:05,392 --> 00:00:06,601
- Hey.
- Hi.

2
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:10,991
- What are you doing?
- I was thinking of moving the couch.

3
00:00:11,272 --> 00:00:12,588
Why would you want to do that?

4
00:00:12,838 --> 00:00:15,234
So there'd be a decent place
for me to sit?

5
00:00:16,665 --> 00:00:20,733
- Rach, there is a decent place.
- And your lap does not count.

6
00:00:22,684 --> 00:00:25,258
- Come on, help me move this.
- No, no, no.

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,811
- No?
- No.

8
00:00:27,102 --> 00:00:28,727
Rosita does not move.

9
00:00:31,695 --> 00:00:34,269
I'm sorry. Rosita? As in...?

10
00:00:34,513 --> 00:00:36,838
As in "Rosita does not move."

11
00:00:37,157 --> 00:00:39,174
It's just a chair.
What's the big deal?

12
00:00:39,453 --> 00:00:42,893
It's the exact equal distance
from the bathroom to the kitchen...

13
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:48,183
...and it's at an angle where you
don't get any glare coming off Stevie.

14
00:00:48,917 --> 00:00:50,649
Stevie the TV?

15
00:00:53,022 --> 00:00:54,895
- Is there a problem?
- No.

16
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,449
What does he know?

17
00:00:59,807 --> 00:01:02,926
Come on, Rosita.
Us chicas gotta stick together.

18
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,137
You bitch!

19
00:01:16,054 --> 00:01:19,209
The One Where Rosita Dies

20
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,949
Hey, you know what's weird?

21
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:58,945
After you guys get married,
when you introduce me to people...

22
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:02,601
...you're gonna have to say,
"This is my brother-in-law, Ross."

23
00:02:02,814 --> 00:02:06,183
Not "my friend, Ross,"
"brother-in-law, Ross."

24
00:02:06,398 --> 00:02:07,537
That's weird, isn't it?

25
00:02:07,893 --> 00:02:10,040
Couldn't I just say,
"This is Ross"?

26
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:12,337
Sure, do whatever you want.

27
00:02:14,783 --> 00:02:15,719
Hey, Ross?

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,361
I checked the real estate section.

29
00:02:19,236 --> 00:02:20,375
Look at this.

30
00:02:20,628 --> 00:02:22,324
Looks like Mom and Dad's house.

31
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,944
Even has a tree
with a broken limb out front.

32
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:30,013
And the window in the attic...

33
00:02:30,335 --> 00:02:32,481
Oh, my God!

34
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:35,967
What happened
to the window in the attic?

35
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:40,591
- I can't believe they're selling it.
- And they didn't tell us.

36
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:43,414
What happened
to the window in the attic?

37
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:50,056
Hello, Dad? Monica and I just saw
the house in the paper.

38
00:02:50,827 --> 00:02:53,223
Yes, we're surprised.

39
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:56,597
Who did you leave a message with?

40
00:02:57,054 --> 00:02:58,928
Sorry!

41
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:04,076
Joey, Joey, I'm so sorry.

42
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,625
I told you not to move it!
How would you feel if, say...

43
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,271
...I wanted to move your mom, okay...

44
00:03:10,484 --> 00:03:12,536
...and you said, "Don't,"
and I did it anyway...

45
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,689
...and her head fell off?

46
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,993
I'll buy you a new one, okay?

47
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:21,682
We'll go to the store and get you
a new chair right now.

48
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:28,365
She's not even cold yet.

49
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:33,202
Wouldn't Rosita have
wanted you to move on?

50
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:37,929
I mean, you know, she did always
put your comfort first.

51
00:03:40,162 --> 00:03:41,549
That's true.

52
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:46,694
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

53
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:50,382
I don't want Stevie
to see her like this.

54
00:03:54,043 --> 00:03:57,827
I can't believe we have to say goodbye
to the house we grew up in.

55
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,926
Man, some stranger's gonna be
in my room.

56
00:04:01,245 --> 00:04:04,021
For 15 years they kept it
as a shrine to you.

57
00:04:04,342 --> 00:04:06,774
It's time the velvet ropes came down.

58
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:09,488
They kept your room a while.

59
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:14,289
Please! Dad turned my room into
a gym 20 minutes after I moved out.

60
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,674
I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack
of Victoria's Secret catalogs?

61
00:04:18,955 --> 00:04:20,270
Not a gym.

62
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:24,480
- Come on. You know they love you.
- As much as they love you?

63
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:28,798
They thought she was barren
until I was born. It's not my fault.

64
00:04:33,636 --> 00:04:35,368
I hate this year.

65
00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:37,244
What's wrong with this year?

66
00:04:37,532 --> 00:04:40,794
It's February and I've only
given two massages...

67
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:43,335
...and they were both horrible tippers.

68
00:04:44,178 --> 00:04:45,458
That was me and Ross.

69
00:04:47,518 --> 00:04:49,701
Oh, that's right.

70
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,863
If you want some extra cash...

71
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,620
...some college friends made
good money doing telemarketing.

72
00:04:55,868 --> 00:04:58,929
That's a great idea.
You're really good on the phone.

73
00:04:59,138 --> 00:05:01,985
It'd be better than the last
telephone job I had.

74
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,116
I probably won't have to say
"spank" as much.

75
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:10,648
What?

76
00:05:11,246 --> 00:05:13,916
Oh, yeah, like you never called.

77
00:05:20,605 --> 00:05:23,522
This is very easy.
You read from the script...

78
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,378
...and try to sell as much
toner as you can.

79
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,248
Okay, I can do that.

80
00:05:28,607 --> 00:05:31,834
By the way, I love my office.

81
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:35,146
- Why don't we do a trial run?
- Oh, okay.

82
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:38,654
All right.

83
00:05:39,184 --> 00:05:41,816
Hi, this is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

84
00:05:42,072 --> 00:05:46,034
- Can I speak to your supply manager?
- I'm the supply manager.

85
00:05:46,386 --> 00:05:48,497
I'd like to talk
about your toner needs.

86
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:49,760
We don't need any.

87
00:05:50,004 --> 00:05:52,056
Okay, sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.

88
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:54,485
Yeah, you're right. This is easy.

89
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:57,759
Okay. What was wrong with that call?

90
00:05:58,007 --> 00:05:59,323
Oh, well, all right.

91
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:03,011
No offense,
but you were kind of rude.

92
00:06:04,546 --> 00:06:07,358
They always say they
don't need toner. That's okay.

93
00:06:07,643 --> 00:06:12,127
Whatever they say, you can find the
answer to it, here in the script.

94
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:14,841
So I think you're ready to sell toner.

95
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:17,106
- Do you have any last questions?
- No.

96
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,638
Wait, yes, I do have one question:

97
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,454
What is toner?

98
00:06:24,656 --> 00:06:26,115
Joey?

99
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:29,240
Joe?

100
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:35,539
Full bag?

101
00:06:37,217 --> 00:06:39,505
Beer's still cold.

102
00:06:41,252 --> 00:06:44,312
Something terrible
must have happened here.

103
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,572
Oh, no, no, no!

104
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,098
Stevie, I was never here.

105
00:07:05,084 --> 00:07:07,551
- Dad?
- I'm here!

106
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:09,708
- Hey.
- Hi.

107
00:07:10,025 --> 00:07:14,260
Seems like just yesterday you guys
used to come out to watch me work.

108
00:07:14,513 --> 00:07:16,802
We can't believe
you're selling the house.

109
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:18,855
Time for a new family
to start here.

110
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,329
I hope their check clears before
they find the crack...

111
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:25,361
...in the foundation
and the asbestos in the ceiling.

112
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:30,198
Let's grab our stuff and
get the hell out of here.

113
00:07:30,761 --> 00:07:34,201
- Sorry we can't store your things.
- Oh, it's okay.

114
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:36,596
I can't wait to see everything again.

115
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:38,793
I don't know what's down here.

116
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,719
But there are six or seven
Easy-Bake Ovens in the attic.

117
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:45,717
I used to love to play restaurant.

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,060
Not as much as you loved to play
"uncooked batter eater."

119
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:54,581
You can't expect a child to wait
for a light bulb to cook brownies.

120
00:07:56,368 --> 00:07:58,835
So I think your boxes are over here.

121
00:07:59,082 --> 00:08:00,434
Oh, great.

122
00:08:00,717 --> 00:08:02,377
Hey...

123
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,611
...whose cigarettes are these?

124
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:08,787
I don't know.

125
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:11,424
They must be your mother's.

126
00:08:11,745 --> 00:08:16,431
But please, please don't ask her.
I'll throw these away.

127
00:08:20,444 --> 00:08:23,742
Cool! Dad, my report cards!

128
00:08:24,062 --> 00:08:25,378
Hey, check this out.

129
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:30,740
Math, "A." Science, "A."
History, "A." Gym...

130
00:08:36,795 --> 00:08:39,536
My rock polisher!

131
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:42,986
Oh, look, there's your old makeup kit.

132
00:08:45,563 --> 00:08:49,002
It's a clown kit. Clown kit!

133
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:52,346
But the white seems to be untouched.

134
00:08:58,576 --> 00:09:00,520
- Uh-oh.
- What?

135
00:09:00,732 --> 00:09:02,950
You know how the garage
floods every spring?

136
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:06,262
How are you ever gonna sell
this place?

137
00:09:07,203 --> 00:09:09,836
I think I accidentally
used Monica's boxes...

138
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:12,522
...to keep the water away
from the Porsche.

139
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:18,502
Oh, no, Dad. Dad?

140
00:09:18,754 --> 00:09:19,690
What the...

141
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:24,277
Oh, God.
Everything's ruined!

142
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:26,746
Dad, she's gonna be crushed.

143
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,722
You don't secretly smoke, do you?

144
00:09:32,636 --> 00:09:33,988
No.

145
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:36,489
So it's just your mother then.

146
00:09:46,657 --> 00:09:50,026
Hi. This is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

147
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:53,228
Can I speak to your
supply manager, please?

148
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:56,255
Earl. Thanks.

149
00:09:57,026 --> 00:10:00,988
Hi, Earl. This is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

150
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:03,772
I'd like to talk to you
about your toner needs.

151
00:10:04,262 --> 00:10:06,551
I don't need any toner.

152
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,296
I hear what you're saying, but at
our prices, everyone needs toner.

153
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:15,140
Not me.

154
00:10:15,535 --> 00:10:17,231
May I ask why?

155
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:20,019
You want to know why?

156
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,034
You want to know why?

157
00:10:22,284 --> 00:10:24,229
I surely do.

158
00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:25,900
Okay.

159
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,265
I don't need any toner...

160
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,572
...because I'm gonna kill myself.

161
00:10:44,272 --> 00:10:46,905
Is that because you're out of toner?

162
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:52,229
Okay, so no toner today.
Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.

163
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:56,897
Wait, wait! I can't let you hang up.
Just please talk to me.

164
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,562
Well...

165
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:01,873
I only had one thing to do today.

166
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:07,782
I guess I could push it back.

167
00:11:08,313 --> 00:11:10,946
Yeah. Now, why do you
want to kill yourself?

168
00:11:12,663 --> 00:11:15,617
I've been working for 10 years
now at this...

169
00:11:15,898 --> 00:11:17,879
...meaningless, dead-end job...

170
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:21,184
...and nobody here
even knows that I exist.

171
00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:23,863
Chandler?

172
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:30,509
I'm sorry?

173
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,532
Look...

174
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:36,248
...I'm sure that people know
you exist.

175
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:38,616
Oh, yeah? I work in a cubicle...

176
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:40,353
...surrounded by people.

177
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:44,762
I've been talking to you for five
minutes now about killing myself...

178
00:11:45,158 --> 00:11:48,348
...and no one's even looked up
from their desk. Hang on.

179
00:11:48,602 --> 00:11:50,369
Hey, everybody...

180
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,079
...I'm gonna kill myself.

181
00:11:54,621 --> 00:11:56,281
I'll get back to you.

182
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:00,006
I got nothing.

183
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:01,358
Wait.

184
00:12:02,345 --> 00:12:04,005
Hey, Marge.

185
00:12:12,017 --> 00:12:14,164
Nothing. Nothing.

186
00:12:17,897 --> 00:12:19,557
Good chair.

187
00:12:20,193 --> 00:12:21,687
Now, if anybody asks...

188
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:24,672
...your name is Rosita.

189
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:46,942
Come on, Joey. I just bought you a new
chair, the most expensive one in the store.

190
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:50,383
You know what I was thinking?
We could name her Francette.

191
00:12:51,054 --> 00:12:52,714
Francette?

192
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,288
What is she, a couch?

193
00:13:01,108 --> 00:13:03,955
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.

194
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,238
Joey, the new chair
will be here in an hour.

195
00:13:08,484 --> 00:13:11,057
Maybe we should move
Rosita out of here.

196
00:13:11,336 --> 00:13:13,554
Start the healing process.

197
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:16,241
Yeah, I guess you're right.

198
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,258
Maybe I'll take her down
to the incinerator.

199
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:21,384
It's gonna be so sad.

200
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:22,846
And kind of cool.

201
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:46,753
She's healed!

202
00:13:51,173 --> 00:13:54,198
- That's weird.
- No, it's not weird.

203
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:56,247
It's a miracle!

204
00:13:57,471 --> 00:14:00,282
It's not a miracle. I'm sure
there's an explanation.

205
00:14:00,532 --> 00:14:04,696
There is. If your heart is pure,
wondrous things can happen.

206
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,065
- I don't...
- Can you tell me how this happened?

207
00:14:11,527 --> 00:14:13,579
- Well, no.
- Miracle.

208
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:19,804
No, you know what, maybe somebody
came in here and fixed it. Or something.

209
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:22,624
Someone like an angel?

210
00:14:25,513 --> 00:14:31,705
That's right, Joey. The chair angel
came in and healed your chair.

211
00:14:33,236 --> 00:14:36,225
Get your non-believer ass
out of my chair!

212
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,414
She'll understand.
I didn't do it on purpose.

213
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:51,188
Dad, that won't matter to her.

214
00:14:51,606 --> 00:14:53,789
Look, all my stuff is safe and dry.

215
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:55,534
And all her stuff is...

216
00:14:55,816 --> 00:14:58,627
...growing new stuff.

217
00:14:59,157 --> 00:15:00,544
This is the kind of thing...

218
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:03,922
...that makes her think
you love me more than her.

219
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,075
My God. Does she think that?

220
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,470
- Can you blame her?
- I don't know.

221
00:15:08,723 --> 00:15:12,234
We may have favored you unconsciously.
You were a marvel.

222
00:15:12,447 --> 00:15:15,780
- The doctors said your mom couldn't...
- I don't want to hear it.

223
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,603
- Really?
- Well, not right now.

224
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:23,366
Monica came here for some memories.
Damn it, we'll give her some.

225
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,380
Okay, grab...

226
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:28,728
Grab some boxes. We'll take stuff
from mine...

227
00:15:29,043 --> 00:15:33,206
...and whatever we can pass off
as hers, we'll put in there.

228
00:15:34,157 --> 00:15:37,075
- Like, this. She could have made this.
- Sure.

229
00:15:37,253 --> 00:15:39,791
And this, she could have won this.

230
00:15:40,002 --> 00:15:42,078
- This could have been hers.
- Sure.

231
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:45,352
- Here, what about this?
- Your makeup kit?

232
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,063
I'd feel better.

233
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:56,142
I am so psyched
I kept this chair for myself.

234
00:16:00,146 --> 00:16:02,198
Yeah. Me too.

235
00:16:05,713 --> 00:16:09,841
- Hey, how's the miracle chair?
- Fine.

236
00:16:10,757 --> 00:16:15,384
You know, this thing has
speakers in the headrest?

237
00:16:15,663 --> 00:16:16,979
- No, really?
- Yeah.

238
00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:19,624
You can hook it to the TV
and you get radio.

239
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:27,307
My chair heals itself.

240
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:34,925
Earl, you're not hearing me. All I'm
saying is, you're not alone, all right?

241
00:16:35,182 --> 00:16:37,470
Everybody hates the people
they work with.

242
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:44,392
Hey, guy.

243
00:16:44,644 --> 00:16:47,111
Wait, that sounded like
someone being nice to you.

244
00:16:47,324 --> 00:16:50,479
No, that's just the "hey, guy" guy.

245
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:54,553
He says that to everybody.
He's the worst.

246
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:57,474
I'd like to take him with me.

247
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,782
All right. Let's just forget about
the people at the office, okay?

248
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:04,779
There's gotta be someone
worth sticking around for.

249
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:08,923
What about family or friends?
Maybe a girlfriend?

250
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,939
Yeah, right.

251
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,205
Oh, sorry. Boyfriend?

252
00:17:14,844 --> 00:17:18,070
- Oh, God.
- No, whatever. Anything.

253
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:19,499
Hey, guy.

254
00:17:22,046 --> 00:17:24,335
Yeah, he's gotta go.

255
00:17:25,873 --> 00:17:26,976
Okay, I should...

256
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,802
...be getting back to my thing now.

257
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,612
See you.

258
00:17:31,857 --> 00:17:34,597
I'm not finished!
Don't you dare hang up on me!

259
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,526
The new girl's good.

260
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:41,699
Hey, guys.

261
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:46,740
I just whipped us up some Easy-Bake treats.
They should be ready in about three days.

262
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:49,873
That's a good one!
You hear that, Ross? Three days!

263
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,505
- Oh, this'll make a great memory.
- Okay.

264
00:17:54,715 --> 00:17:56,447
Which boxes are mine?

265
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:59,236
- These are yours right here.
- Okay.

266
00:17:59,968 --> 00:18:01,498
A coloring book.

267
00:18:01,952 --> 00:18:03,410
You loved that thing.

268
00:18:03,657 --> 00:18:06,326
You never went anywhere without...

269
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:08,487
...without that coloring book.

270
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:09,840
Really?

271
00:18:10,197 --> 00:18:12,700
Looks like I had trouble
staying in the lines.

272
00:18:13,016 --> 00:18:14,439
Nuh-uh!

273
00:18:17,469 --> 00:18:19,972
- An old glove?
- Yeah, you loved that glove.

274
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:24,110
You took it every place you went. You
never went anyplace without the glove.

275
00:18:25,018 --> 00:18:26,086
Wow, look at this.

276
00:18:26,376 --> 00:18:29,116
I can't believe I even
fit into this shirt.

277
00:18:33,925 --> 00:18:35,099
Oh, this is yours.

278
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:38,126
I don't know how that got in there.

279
00:18:38,623 --> 00:18:40,532
This isn't mine.

280
00:18:41,476 --> 00:18:43,457
Hey, this isn't my stuff.

281
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:46,998
Ross, these are your boxes.

282
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:52,320
Where are my boxes?

283
00:18:53,582 --> 00:18:55,658
Your boxes are...

284
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,033
- What?
- Dad?

285
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:04,916
The garage flooded, sweetie,
and ruined your boxes. I'm sorry.

286
00:19:05,446 --> 00:19:06,418
Just mine?

287
00:19:06,664 --> 00:19:08,253
I'm afraid so.

288
00:19:08,543 --> 00:19:11,805
Why wasn't Ross' stuff ruined?

289
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:16,255
And if you say the words "medical marvel,"
I'm going to Easy-Bake your head.

290
00:19:18,354 --> 00:19:22,067
I used your boxes to divert
water away from the Porsche.

291
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:24,990
Ross' stuff is fine,
but I have no memories...

292
00:19:25,243 --> 00:19:28,161
...so you could keep the bottom
of your car from water?

293
00:19:28,374 --> 00:19:30,972
There was also
leaves and gook and stuff.

294
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:35,257
I can't believe this!

295
00:19:42,117 --> 00:19:44,335
Screw it. I'm having one.

296
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,732
- Hey, Chandler.
- Hey.

297
00:19:53,946 --> 00:19:57,066
How'd you like to sit
in a chair that reclines...

298
00:19:57,425 --> 00:19:59,370
...has a rolling massage...

299
00:19:59,653 --> 00:20:01,870
...and speakers in the headrest?

300
00:20:02,123 --> 00:20:04,139
I've tried that so many times...

301
00:20:04,383 --> 00:20:07,230
...they won't even let me
in the store anymore.

302
00:20:08,872 --> 00:20:12,027
What if I said you could
do it in my apartment?

303
00:20:12,282 --> 00:20:13,491
Are you telling me...

304
00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:17,075
...you bought the chair
that makes all others obsolete?

305
00:20:17,396 --> 00:20:22,118
The chair that Sit Magazine called
"Chair of the Year"?

306
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:24,978
I just purchased...

307
00:20:25,294 --> 00:20:29,422
...the La-Z-Boy E-Cliner 3000.

308
00:20:29,677 --> 00:20:31,895
Well, that's awesome! That's great!
What made you do it?

309
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:35,102
It's a long story, but,
I broke Joey's chair...

310
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:37,948
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You broke Joey's chair?

311
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:41,534
I thought I did, that's why
I replaced it with mine.

312
00:20:43,212 --> 00:20:45,643
That's how it got fixed!

313
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:49,229
You thought that elves
came in and fixed it?

314
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:50,790
No.

315
00:20:51,144 --> 00:20:52,946
Angels.

316
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:56,082
I'm getting my chair back.

317
00:20:59,215 --> 00:21:02,549
Well, looks like
it wasn't healed after all!

318
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,382
I guess this chair's mine now.

319
00:21:09,723 --> 00:21:11,276
Joey, you broke my chair!

320
00:21:11,532 --> 00:21:12,468
Your chair?

321
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,704
He thought he broke it,
so he switched chairs.

322
00:21:15,951 --> 00:21:17,575
So there was no miracle?

323
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:19,596
No, Joe. No miracle.

324
00:21:19,952 --> 00:21:21,825
Oh, no! This is devastating!

325
00:21:23,744 --> 00:21:28,157
My faith is shaken. I'm glad I have
a new chair to get me through this.

326
00:21:29,902 --> 00:21:32,607
Nice try, but you don't
get that chair anymore.

327
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:35,777
That is my chair now.
You can sit on my lap.

328
00:21:36,303 --> 00:21:38,177
No, I take that back!

329
00:21:39,226 --> 00:21:41,931
I think I should get the chair.

330
00:21:44,653 --> 00:21:47,678
- How do you figure?
- You broke a chair and you broke a chair.

331
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:51,080
The only one here that hasn't
broken a chair is me.

332
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:53,896
No, no, no. This chair's
not going anywhere.

333
00:21:54,117 --> 00:21:56,964
- Where's the logic in that?
- The logic...

334
00:21:57,178 --> 00:21:59,575
...is that there are two of us...

335
00:21:59,788 --> 00:22:03,572
...and we are both strong enough
to break a chair in half.

336
00:22:04,102 --> 00:22:07,435
So Joey breaks my chair,
and I get nothing?

337
00:22:10,783 --> 00:22:12,241
That's right.

338
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:17,037
What are you guys, like,
a gang or something?

339
00:22:19,341 --> 00:22:21,453
Yeah, we are.

340
00:22:23,446 --> 00:22:24,940
We're the Cobras.

341
00:22:28,248 --> 00:22:32,210
Where can I find Earl?
He's the supply manager here.

342
00:22:32,492 --> 00:22:33,844
I don't know any Earl.

343
00:22:34,128 --> 00:22:36,346
I'm right here!

344
00:22:39,868 --> 00:22:41,220
Earl?

345
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:44,419
I'm Phoebe.

346
00:22:44,704 --> 00:22:46,020
Phoebe?

347
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,559
The lady who sells toner?

348
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:51,452
Look, you can't kill yourself.

349
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:54,782
Look, I really appreciate
you coming down...

350
00:22:55,037 --> 00:22:56,662
No, I can't let you do it.

351
00:22:56,985 --> 00:23:01,113
- Why?
- Because, fate made me call you today.

352
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,030
I thought it was toner.

353
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:08,043
Think about it, okay?
This isn't even my regular job.

354
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:11,455
My first day, you're my first call.

355
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:15,283
Somebody else may have hung up,
but I wouldn't do that...

356
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:17,367
...because I know about this stuff.

357
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:20,321
- My mom killed herself.
- Really?

358
00:23:20,922 --> 00:23:23,496
- How?
- I'm not gonna give you tips.

359
00:23:25,515 --> 00:23:27,317
Don't you see that this...

360
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:31,316
...all came together so I could
stop you from doing this?

361
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,871
- Couldn't it just be a coincidence?
- No, it's fate.

362
00:23:36,857 --> 00:23:39,847
It doesn't really seem like
enough to be fate.

363
00:23:40,161 --> 00:23:41,265
Oh, well.

364
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:43,322
Okay, here's a weird thing.

365
00:23:43,607 --> 00:23:47,711
My mother was also a supply manager.

366
00:23:49,312 --> 00:23:51,151
I'm actually the office manager.

367
00:23:51,434 --> 00:23:53,343
Oh, my God! So was she!

368
00:23:53,626 --> 00:23:55,773
And get this, okay.

369
00:23:56,096 --> 00:23:59,607
Your name is Earl, right?
Her name was Pearl.

370
00:23:59,924 --> 00:24:02,071
Puh-Earl.

371
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:05,027
Was there anything else?

372
00:24:05,281 --> 00:24:06,290
Sure.

373
00:24:09,109 --> 00:24:10,045
Where're you from?

374
00:24:10,326 --> 00:24:12,923
- Philadelphia.
- Oh, my God, so was she!

375
00:24:14,849 --> 00:24:16,617
I've got goose bumps.

376
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,405
- Really?
- I'm wearing layers, and it's warm.

377
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:24,373
These jerks might not care about you...

378
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,480
...but the universe does,
and that says a lot.

379
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,129
Did you hear that?

380
00:24:32,663 --> 00:24:35,094
I don't need you guys
to care about me...

381
00:24:35,342 --> 00:24:37,394
...because the universe cares!

382
00:24:37,673 --> 00:24:39,926
The whole universe!

383
00:24:45,362 --> 00:24:48,351
I really wish they'd care
a little bit.

384
00:24:49,327 --> 00:24:51,997
You know, I don't think it's you.
This is a freaky place.

385
00:24:53,224 --> 00:24:55,062
Hey, guys!

386
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:57,807
- Oh, no, it's you.
- Yeah.

387
00:25:00,253 --> 00:25:02,091
Oh, this is terrible.

388
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,319
Everything is destroyed.

389
00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:06,721
Look at this.

390
00:25:07,002 --> 00:25:11,201
It meant enough for me to save,
and now I can't tell what it is.

391
00:25:12,464 --> 00:25:14,445
It's still soft.

392
00:25:17,022 --> 00:25:18,860
What do you think this is?

393
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:22,409
I think it was a mouse.

394
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:33,716
- How are you, honey?
- How do you think I am?

395
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,396
You've wrecked my childhood memories...

396
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,307
...you love Ross more than me.

397
00:25:38,628 --> 00:25:41,333
And I just rubbed
a dead mouse on my face.

398
00:25:43,602 --> 00:25:47,837
Sweetheart, we love you
just as much as Ross.

399
00:25:48,091 --> 00:25:49,965
I'm sorry about what happened...

400
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:53,617
...and I probably can't
make it up to you...

401
00:25:53,936 --> 00:25:55,739
...but here's a start.

402
00:25:58,703 --> 00:26:01,763
- What's this?
- It's the key to my Porsche.

403
00:26:02,043 --> 00:26:04,119
Well, the key to your Porsche.

404
00:26:05,383 --> 00:26:06,486
What?

405
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:08,293
What?!

406
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:14,353
I've considered getting rid of it.
I saw my reflection the other day.

407
00:26:14,672 --> 00:26:17,792
Your mother's right,
I do look like an ass.

408
00:26:18,986 --> 00:26:21,619
You're giving it to me?
You're kidding.

409
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:24,756
Well, wait a minute.

410
00:26:25,005 --> 00:26:28,646
A couple of stupid boxes get wet,
and she gets a Porsche?

411
00:26:30,885 --> 00:26:32,794
- Let's take a drive?
- All right!

412
00:26:33,077 --> 00:26:36,623
What about me? I'm a medical marvel!

413
00:26:55,587 --> 00:26:56,832
Hey, guys.

414
00:26:57,118 --> 00:26:58,850
Have you seen Chandler's chair?

415
00:26:59,135 --> 00:27:01,116
Joey broke it. He got rid of it.

416
00:27:01,362 --> 00:27:05,526
Are you kidding? I get a Porsche
and the Barcalounger's gone?

417
00:27:05,816 --> 00:27:08,841
This is the best day ever!
