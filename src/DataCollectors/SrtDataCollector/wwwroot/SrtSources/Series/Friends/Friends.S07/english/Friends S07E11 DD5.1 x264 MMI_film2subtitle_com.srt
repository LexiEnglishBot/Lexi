1
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,435
You have got to try this cheesecake.

2
00:00:07,684 --> 00:00:10,389
You know, I'm not that much
of a sweet tooth...

3
00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:13,867
Oh, my God, it's so creamy!

4
00:00:14,468 --> 00:00:17,209
That's the best
cheesecake I've ever had!

5
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:19,155
Where did you get this?

6
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:23,681
It was at the front door when I got
home. Somebody sent it to us.

7
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:26,392
This isn't addressed to you.

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,941
This is addressed
to Mrs. Braverman downstairs!

9
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:31,688
Thief!

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,061
I didn't read the box
before I opened it...

11
00:00:35,343 --> 00:00:37,917
...and you can't return a box
after you opened it!

12
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:41,258
- Why not?
- Because it's too delicious!

13
00:00:42,998 --> 00:00:45,465
You stole this cheesecake.
That's wrong.

14
00:00:45,816 --> 00:00:50,300
No, it'll be okay because Mrs.
Braverman will send for a free one.

15
00:00:50,582 --> 00:00:52,242
That way, we all win.

16
00:00:52,496 --> 00:00:56,386
The only losers are the
big cheesecake conglomerate...

17
00:00:56,741 --> 00:00:59,172
..."Mama's Little Bakery."

18
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,750
I feel terrible.

19
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:04,494
I'm a horrible, horrible person.

20
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:07,481
I'm sorry, what?

21
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:13,537
The One With All The Cheesecakes

22
00:01:47,293 --> 00:01:49,725
I should get going. Big day at work.

23
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:51,988
You know how I'm in a coma?

24
00:01:52,616 --> 00:01:56,257
Today they do a test on me and it
turns out I'm not brain-dead.

25
00:01:57,174 --> 00:01:58,277
So...

26
00:01:58,531 --> 00:02:00,084
Mr. Smarty Pants.

27
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,665
It's just my character
that's not brain-dead.

28
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,552
Pheebs, still on for tonight?

29
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:08,054
- Absolutely.
- I'll see you at 8.

30
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:09,871
What's at 8?

31
00:02:10,186 --> 00:02:15,014
Dinner. We get together about once
a month to discuss the rest of you.

32
00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:18,423
Wow! Did not know that.

33
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,248
May I say how lovely you look today?

34
00:02:21,528 --> 00:02:22,499
Duly noted.

35
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:28,058
So for tomorrow, do you want to
rent a car and drive down together?

36
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:31,858
- What are you talking about?
- Cousin Frannie's wedding.

37
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:35,293
You were invited?

38
00:02:36,418 --> 00:02:37,948
No.

39
00:02:38,228 --> 00:02:40,445
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.

40
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,128
I thought only Mom and Dad
were invited.

41
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:47,516
From the ages of 7 to 9,
Frannie and I were inseparable.

42
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:51,544
Maybe since the age of 9,
Frannie's made some new friends.

43
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,828
Do you wanna make some new friends?

44
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:01,005
It's probably just a mistake.
Let me call Aunt Cheryl.

45
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,524
Maybe you are invited and the
invitation got lost in the mail.

46
00:03:04,774 --> 00:03:07,799
You call her and tell her
that when we were kids...

47
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:11,271
...her precious Frannie
tried to undress me several times.

48
00:03:11,593 --> 00:03:15,104
If I hadn't stopped her, there
wouldn't be a wedding to go to.

49
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,089
She tried to undress me too.

50
00:03:18,795 --> 00:03:21,393
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.

51
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,707
Joseph Francis Tribbiani,
are you home yet?

52
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:35,039
I think he's still out.
What's wrong?

53
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:37,646
I'll tell you, Rachel Karen Greene.

54
00:03:37,895 --> 00:03:40,849
I had plans with Joey,
and he left me this note.

55
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:44,570
"Pheebs, can't make it.
Got a date. Talk to you later.

56
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:46,408
Big Daddy."

57
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:50,415
- "Big Daddy"?
- That's a nickname we were trying.

58
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:53,475
Why didn't you guys try "Francis"?

59
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:57,478
Francis is a cooler name than Chandler,
isn't it?

60
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,590
You know what nickname
never caught on? "The Ross-a-tron."

61
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,277
Here's Joseph Francis!

62
00:04:09,556 --> 00:04:12,747
Wait, what are you
middle-naming me for?

63
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:14,425
I left you a note.

64
00:04:14,635 --> 00:04:16,924
That doesn't give you the
right to ditch me!

65
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,099
You can cancel plans with friends
if there's a possibility for sex.

66
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,462
He's right. That is the rule.

67
00:04:23,716 --> 00:04:25,448
- Really?
- Well, that's what I hear.

68
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,405
I've never gotten a chance
to actually employ the rule.

69
00:04:30,118 --> 00:04:34,081
I don't accept it. When we make
plans, I expect you to show up.

70
00:04:34,293 --> 00:04:37,484
I'm not a way to kill time
till you meet someone better.

71
00:04:37,807 --> 00:04:42,398
Boyfriends and girlfriends will
come and go, but this is for life.

72
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:46,710
I'm so sorry. I had no idea
it would bother you this much.

73
00:04:46,992 --> 00:04:48,272
Well, it does.

74
00:04:48,558 --> 00:04:50,634
Well, can I make it up to you?

75
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,132
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:56,308
How about dinner tomorrow night?
I'll pay for myself.

77
00:04:58,787 --> 00:05:00,590
Okay, you wore me down.

78
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:06,637
While you're over there, how
about a beer for "The Ross-a-tron"?

79
00:05:07,936 --> 00:05:09,846
"Ross..." Is that back?

80
00:05:20,392 --> 00:05:22,194
The other cheesecake came.

81
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,840
They delivered it here again.

82
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,525
Just bring it downstairs.
What's the problem?

83
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:30,685
I can't seem to say goodbye.

84
00:05:31,003 --> 00:05:32,248
Are you serious?

85
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,726
We ate an entire cake
two days ago and you want more?

86
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:38,587
Well, I've forgotten
what it tastes like.

87
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:41,748
It was cheesecake. It was fine.

88
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:45,817
It had a buttery, crumbly,
graham cracker crust...

89
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:48,878
...with a very rich...

90
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:53,055
...yet light cream cheese filling.

91
00:05:55,323 --> 00:05:57,720
Wow, my whole mouth
just filled with saliva.

92
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,366
Know what? Forget it.
We're just hungry.

93
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:04,086
We haven't had lunch.
We're just lightheaded.

94
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:07,773
So let's go have lunch
and forget about the cheesecake.

95
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,452
We'll drop it off
so we're not tempted.

96
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:13,892
- Where do you want to eat?
- Mama's Little Bakery, Chicago.

97
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,587
Mel Tormé died.

98
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:24,442
Joey, that paper's like a year old.

99
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:28,162
Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale
is over?

100
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,281
So I finally heard back
from Aunt Cheryl...

101
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:37,035
...and apparently it wasn't a mistake.

102
00:06:37,386 --> 00:06:39,083
There's limited seating...

103
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:44,020
Limited seating? I am just
one tiny person!

104
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:46,846
Yeah, but she doesn't know that.

105
00:06:47,163 --> 00:06:49,630
I mean, the last time she saw you...

106
00:06:49,981 --> 00:06:53,908
...you'd have turned one of those
little wedding chairs into kindling.

107
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,460
"Limited seating."
That's such a lame excuse.

108
00:06:58,714 --> 00:07:01,216
That's not the reason
she's not inviting me.

109
00:07:01,531 --> 00:07:05,315
What's the big deal? I wasn't invited
to the ceremony, just the reception.

110
00:07:05,602 --> 00:07:09,979
If it makes you feel any better, Joan
and I will just make an appearance...

111
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:13,525
...and then we'll leave early
as a sign of protest.

112
00:07:13,743 --> 00:07:16,032
- Joan?
- Yeah, my date.

113
00:07:16,283 --> 00:07:20,281
Assistant professor in linguistics.
Tall, very beautiful.

114
00:07:20,597 --> 00:07:24,868
And despite what some people say,
not broad-backed.

115
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,040
Wait a minute.
You got "Ross Geller and Guest"?

116
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,512
I wasn't invited,
and you got "and Guest"?

117
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:34,885
Excuse me, I do have to interrupt
on Ross' behalf.

118
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,083
I think the rule applies here.

119
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:39,514
Since he has a chance
to get on broad-back...

120
00:07:39,837 --> 00:07:41,047
Not broad-back!

121
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:45,817
Dude, I've seen her.
She's like a billboard.

122
00:07:47,492 --> 00:07:49,888
Wait a minute. You're bringing me.

123
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,700
I can't cancel on Joan.

124
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:53,924
- Why not?
- Did you not hear me?

125
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:57,955
She's an assistant professor
in the linguistics department.

126
00:07:58,276 --> 00:08:00,221
They're wild.

127
00:08:00,886 --> 00:08:04,112
- Why do you want to come anyway?
- Because...

128
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,789
...she's my cousin.

129
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:08,881
I mean, we grew up together.

130
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:12,950
Family, you know?
And all that's important to me.

131
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,157
Okay, all right. I'll take you.

132
00:08:16,473 --> 00:08:18,169
I'll go call Joan.

133
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:20,985
Oh, that's nice.

134
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:23,006
Family should be there.

135
00:08:23,258 --> 00:08:25,369
It's her wedding.
Happiest day of her life.

136
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:27,281
We'll see.

137
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,141
Well, thank you for lunch.

138
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:36,334
Wait, I thought you paid.

139
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,287
Apparently, we don't pay
for food anymore.

140
00:08:42,324 --> 00:08:44,921
- Do you see what I see?
- It's still there.

141
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,334
Mrs. Braverman must be out.

142
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:55,086
She could be out of town.
Maybe gone for months.

143
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:58,915
By then, it may spoil.
She can't come back to bad cheesecake.

144
00:08:59,162 --> 00:09:01,036
- It could kill her.
- Don't want that.

145
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:02,385
We're protecting her.

146
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:03,886
- We'll take it.
- But quick.

147
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:06,010
- Why?
- I hear her in there.

148
00:09:06,364 --> 00:09:08,653
Go! Go! Go!

149
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:15,507
Do you think it's inappropriate to wear
a white, lacy dress to a wedding?

150
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:18,191
- Yes.
- Excellent.

151
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:23,718
Oh, my God, that's David.

152
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:25,912
- Who?
- David, the scientist guy.

153
00:09:26,195 --> 00:09:28,105
David that I was in love with.

154
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:30,891
Who went to Russia
and broke my heart, David.

155
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:32,144
Oh, my God!

156
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,640
Say their name enough,
they turn around.

157
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,087
Phoebe.

158
00:09:38,408 --> 00:09:40,281
David.

159
00:09:42,861 --> 00:09:45,886
What are you doing?
Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?

160
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:48,906
I'm just in town for a conference.

161
00:09:49,124 --> 00:09:51,721
God, you look phenomenal.

162
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:53,433
Well...

163
00:09:53,681 --> 00:09:54,855
Yeah.

164
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:58,476
You look great too.
Did you get a haircut?

165
00:09:58,796 --> 00:10:01,263
Yeah. Well, I got like 30 of them.

166
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:05,257
Look, I got a confession to make.

167
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,763
I was hoping to run into you here.

168
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,693
I didn't know if I should call.
I was only in town a few days...

169
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:14,378
...and I didn't want to intrude
on your life.

170
00:10:14,591 --> 00:10:16,429
I really wanted to see you...

171
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:19,595
...but I didn't know
if you wanted to see me.

172
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:24,919
Of course I would want to see you.
I think about you all the time.

173
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,156
Really? Because I think about you
all the time.

174
00:10:28,472 --> 00:10:32,435
There's a statue in Minsk
that reminds me of you so much.

175
00:10:32,752 --> 00:10:34,934
It's actually of Lenin...

176
00:10:35,187 --> 00:10:38,378
...but, you know, at certain angles...

177
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:41,797
Anyway, do you want
to have dinner tonight?

178
00:10:42,145 --> 00:10:43,355
Yes.

179
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,302
Oh, no!

180
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,744
- What?
- I can't.

181
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:51,251
I can't believe I have plans.
Can you do it tomorrow?

182
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:56,060
No, I have to go in a few hours.
I have to be on the redeye.

183
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,973
Listen, next time you're in Minsk...

184
00:10:59,402 --> 00:11:02,593
Phoebe? Can I talk to you
for a second?

185
00:11:02,882 --> 00:11:04,340
What are you doing?

186
00:11:04,586 --> 00:11:06,010
I have plans with Joey.

187
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,786
So? He'll understand.

188
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:10,735
No, he won't.
And that's not even the point.

189
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:16,066
I made a whole speech about how
you do not cancel plans with friends.

190
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,953
And now just because, potentially,
the love of my life...

191
00:11:20,243 --> 00:11:22,461
...returns from Russia
for one night...

192
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:25,488
...I should change my beliefs?

193
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,791
I should change my beliefs!

194
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:32,974
No. If I don't have my principles,
I don't have anything.

195
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:34,358
You're so strong.

196
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:38,643
Or I should rush through dinner
with Joey and meet David at 9.

197
00:11:42,857 --> 00:11:45,075
Oh, my God, that is so good!

198
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:48,732
I'm full. And yet I know
if I stop eating this...

199
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:50,639
...I'll regret it.

200
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:54,333
Hey, what have you got there?

201
00:11:54,652 --> 00:11:55,968
Oh, it's...

202
00:11:56,252 --> 00:11:58,469
It's tofu cake. Want some?

203
00:12:02,724 --> 00:12:04,527
What are you doing tonight?

204
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,027
Dude. Dude.

205
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,713
Sorry.

206
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,691
I got plans with Phoebe.

207
00:12:11,943 --> 00:12:14,719
Really? Monica said
she had a date at 9.

208
00:12:15,005 --> 00:12:17,674
- What? Tonight?
- That's what Monica said.

209
00:12:17,962 --> 00:12:22,553
After that speech, she makes a date on
the same night she has plans with me?

210
00:12:22,764 --> 00:12:25,539
She's trying to pull a fast one
on Big Daddy.

211
00:12:26,903 --> 00:12:30,023
- Now, if you'll excuse me...
- Dude, dude!

212
00:12:30,244 --> 00:12:33,684
If I took off my pants right now,
how would you feel?

213
00:12:33,897 --> 00:12:36,008
Like your cousin Glenn.

214
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:45,061
Here, I think this is us.

215
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:48,891
Limited seating, my ass.

216
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:51,212
Let's see who made the cut.

217
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:53,375
Hi. I'm Monica Geller.

218
00:12:53,624 --> 00:12:57,028
- How do you know the bride and groom?
- I worked with Frannie.

219
00:12:57,312 --> 00:12:59,600
Used to work with her. Used to.

220
00:12:59,852 --> 00:13:02,034
I'm a relative
and I didn't get invited.

221
00:13:02,391 --> 00:13:04,787
A blood relative. Blood.

222
00:13:06,393 --> 00:13:09,204
Stop saying "blood" to strangers.

223
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:14,011
From the ages of 7 to 9, we were
inseparable, and I didn't even get invited!

224
00:13:14,255 --> 00:13:16,271
Then why are you here?

225
00:13:16,516 --> 00:13:19,434
- I'm my brother's date.
- Hey, I had a date, okay?

226
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:23,087
Joan Tedeschi, the linguist.

227
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:27,020
So how about you?
How do you know the happy couple?

228
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:29,415
We went to college with both of them.

229
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:31,720
Now we live next door.

230
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,388
Okay, you're fine.

231
00:13:34,957 --> 00:13:38,562
You know, you would've liked Joan,
she's very pleasant.

232
00:13:39,723 --> 00:13:44,444
There! There! Her back looks like that.
That's not broad, is it?

233
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:52,062
Come on, Joey, you've got to be ready
to order by now.

234
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:55,616
You know, I don't I like this table
either. Maybe we should move again.

235
00:13:55,832 --> 00:13:59,022
No, we're staying right here.
Excuse me, we're ready to order.

236
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:00,735
I don't work here.

237
00:14:01,816 --> 00:14:03,998
Well, then you shouldn't be
walking around.

238
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:10,154
- Are you guys ready?
- Yes.

239
00:14:10,444 --> 00:14:14,643
I'll have a green salad,
house dressing and water's fine.

240
00:14:15,002 --> 00:14:16,425
And for you, sir?

241
00:14:16,707 --> 00:14:19,304
Yeah. This slow-roasted salmon...

242
00:14:19,594 --> 00:14:21,053
...how slow are we talking?

243
00:14:22,134 --> 00:14:24,210
It's already been roasted.

244
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,283
Oh, then no. Maybe I should hear
the specials again.

245
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:31,178
We've heard the specials three times.

246
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:35,420
There's prime rib, mahi-mahi
and a very special lobster ravioli.

247
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:40,293
- Actually, we're out of the ravioli.
- Well, that changes everything!

248
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,740
You know what, Pheebs?
You were right before.

249
00:14:45,027 --> 00:14:46,936
Friends are so important.

250
00:14:47,218 --> 00:14:49,436
Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.

251
00:14:49,793 --> 00:14:51,251
Know what I really want?

252
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:54,698
- What?
- Is to have a long, long talk.

253
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:58,902
You know? Get Joey out on the
open road and really open him up.

254
00:15:00,022 --> 00:15:01,754
- Any progress?
- Yes.

255
00:15:02,492 --> 00:15:04,781
I will have the lobster ravioli.

256
00:15:05,693 --> 00:15:07,946
God, Joey, this is taking forever.

257
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:09,797
- What's the rush?
- Well...

258
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,675
...I have an appointment.

259
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:14,732
And it's very important.

260
00:15:15,017 --> 00:15:16,191
What is it?

261
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,349
Well...

262
00:15:18,671 --> 00:15:19,986
...it's a date.

263
00:15:20,306 --> 00:15:24,754
A date? No, you must be mistaken,
because you wouldn't have a date...

264
00:15:25,037 --> 00:15:27,611
...on the same night
you have plans with a friend.

265
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,763
Don't make me feel badly.

266
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,435
No, I'm gonna!

267
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:36,646
You made me feel really guilty
about going out with that girl.

268
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:40,828
Like I did something terrible.
Now you're doing the same thing.

269
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,330
It's not! It's totally different!

270
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:46,772
This is with David.
Remember David, the scientist guy?

271
00:15:47,026 --> 00:15:48,556
He's very special to me.

272
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:52,309
My girl the other night was special.
She was a scientist too.

273
00:15:52,592 --> 00:15:55,509
- She was?
- Well, she graduated high school.

274
00:15:56,384 --> 00:15:57,973
Whatever. Know what?

275
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,844
He's only here for four
hours and I'm gonna go see him.

276
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,750
- Fine!
- Yeah.

277
00:16:06,056 --> 00:16:10,019
What are you still doing here?
I told you, lobster ravioli!

278
00:16:13,815 --> 00:16:16,733
I was about to leave.
I didn't think you were coming.

279
00:16:16,946 --> 00:16:19,164
I wouldn't have missed this.

280
00:16:19,555 --> 00:16:21,500
Well, I'm very glad you're here.

281
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:24,172
Oh, you're such a gentleman.

282
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:26,478
Come on, we're going to my place.

283
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:35,765
Are you eating the cheesecake
without me?

284
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,055
I will give you $ 100
to whistle right now.

285
00:16:46,902 --> 00:16:49,476
- How can you eat it without me?
- What'll you do?

286
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,680
Tell Monica or Joey?
No, you'd have to tell them everything.

287
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:57,748
We're dessert stealers.
We're living outside the law.

288
00:16:58,001 --> 00:17:00,254
I don't trust you with this cake.

289
00:17:00,506 --> 00:17:02,902
I got it first,
and I'm taking it back!

290
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:05,925
- What? Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

291
00:17:06,524 --> 00:17:08,849
You think I trust you with it?

292
00:17:09,134 --> 00:17:10,557
No, we'll split it.

293
00:17:10,873 --> 00:17:12,641
That's not fair. You had some.

294
00:17:12,961 --> 00:17:15,736
I think Monica would be
very interested to know...

295
00:17:16,022 --> 00:17:18,940
...that you called her cheesecake
"dry and mealy."

296
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:21,336
What do we use to split it?

297
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:25,970
All right, pick a half.

298
00:17:27,086 --> 00:17:30,111
Well, this side looks bigger.

299
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:34,461
But there's more crust on this side.

300
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:36,435
Maybe if I measure it...

301
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:37,863
Pick a piece!

302
00:17:38,151 --> 00:17:41,970
- All right, I pick that one.
- It's the smaller piece.

303
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,582
Okay. There you go.

304
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:47,782
Enjoy your half, my friend.
But that is it.

305
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:51,399
No sharing, no switching,
and don't come crying to me...

306
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:53,938
...if you eat your piece too fast.

307
00:18:04,557 --> 00:18:08,198
- You gonna give me some of yours?
- Oh, no.

308
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,662
No switching, no sharing.
And don't come crying to me.

309
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:15,751
I may just sit here
and have my cake all day.

310
00:18:16,073 --> 00:18:19,098
Just sit here in the hallway
and eat my...

311
00:18:31,034 --> 00:18:33,015
Ross, sweetheart!

312
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,098
Oh, hey, Aunt Millie.

313
00:18:35,383 --> 00:18:39,345
- Isn't it a beautiful wedding?
- Yes, it is.

314
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:45,951
Every time, on the lips!

315
00:18:46,273 --> 00:18:48,182
Why? Why on the lips?

316
00:18:51,456 --> 00:18:53,923
There's Frannie.
Won't she be happy to see me?

317
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,043
You be nice, all right?

318
00:18:56,292 --> 00:18:58,581
I didn't bring you to ambush her.

319
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:01,962
Frannie was the one
who showed your Playboys to Mom.

320
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,152
That bitch.

321
00:19:08,574 --> 00:19:09,713
Monica!

322
00:19:10,035 --> 00:19:11,174
What...?

323
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:13,858
Am I doing here?
Surprised to see me?

324
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,501
Ross brought me.
How do you like that?

325
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,182
Hi, Frannie. Congratulations.

326
00:19:21,064 --> 00:19:24,184
You invite my whole family,
and not me? Why?

327
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:27,878
Why wouldn't you want me here?
What could I have done?

328
00:19:29,553 --> 00:19:31,285
Stuart!

329
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,281
I believe you know my husband.

330
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:39,770
So it's really a question
of "who" could you have done.

331
00:19:48,515 --> 00:19:50,840
I hate this, but I have to go.

332
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,235
I can't miss my flight.

333
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,813
I bet there's
another flight to Minsk in...

334
00:19:56,134 --> 00:19:57,759
July.

335
00:20:07,267 --> 00:20:09,972
That's really beautiful.
What does it mean?

336
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,762
"Please clean my beakers."

337
00:20:13,495 --> 00:20:15,404
I don't get out of the lab much.

338
00:20:18,192 --> 00:20:20,694
I thought it meant something else.

339
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,485
Yeah, well, I really actually
wanted to say...

340
00:20:24,802 --> 00:20:26,261
...that.

341
00:20:26,577 --> 00:20:29,982
But I figured I probably shouldn't
because...

342
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:32,727
...I have to leave.

343
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:35,410
No, you're right. Don't say it.

344
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,300
I do, though.

345
00:20:41,398 --> 00:20:42,857
I do too.

346
00:20:51,662 --> 00:20:53,464
Well, bye, Phoebe.

347
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:08,387
Now's not the time, Joey.
You can yell at me tomorrow.

348
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,379
Wait, no, Pheebs.
I'm not gonna yell at you.

349
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:14,239
I just started thinking
about you and David...

350
00:21:14,554 --> 00:21:18,623
...and I remember how bummed you were
the first time he left.

351
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:22,866
Oh, Pheebs, come here.

352
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:27,381
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

353
00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:31,453
The only guy I've ever been
crazy about is going to Minsk...

354
00:21:31,777 --> 00:21:34,374
...and I may never see him again.

355
00:21:34,872 --> 00:21:36,426
You could always visit him.

356
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:39,254
Right. Like they'll let me
have a passport.

357
00:21:40,683 --> 00:21:43,459
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.

358
00:21:45,415 --> 00:21:47,360
Well, now...

359
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:51,709
...if you achieve distillation of
subatomic particles before he does...

360
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:53,721
...then he could come back.

361
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,770
I could give it a shot.

362
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,329
Oh, look! There's a piece
that doesn't have floor on it.

363
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:15,253
- Stick to your side!
- Come on, now!

364
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:28,375
All right, what are we having?

365
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:39,294
- Oh, wait, I forgot my wrap.
- Oh, I'll wait here for you.

366
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:41,567
- I can't go back there!
- Why?

367
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:45,391
Did you see the way Stuart was staring
at me? I think he still wants me.

368
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:48,071
- Oh, my God.
- Just go do it!

369
00:22:48,318 --> 00:22:50,606
All right, wait here.

370
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:10,685
Hi, sweetie! Are you leaving?

371
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:13,600
- Well...
- Give us a kiss. Come on.

372
00:23:22,518 --> 00:23:26,232
Why? Why on the lips?
