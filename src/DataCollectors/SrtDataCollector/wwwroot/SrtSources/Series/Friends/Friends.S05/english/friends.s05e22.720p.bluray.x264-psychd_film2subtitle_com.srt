1
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,223
What's going on?

2
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,517
Well, my eye is a little itchy.

3
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,396
Uh, mine too. Yeah.

4
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,400
Wow, it's really red.
You should go see my eye doctor.

5
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,944
Richard?
I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend.

6
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,822
Richard, that's all I ever hear.
Richard, Richard, Richard.

7
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,784
Since we've been going out,
I think I've mentioned his name twice.

8
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,911
Okay. So Richard, Richard.

9
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:42,291
It's not Richard, okay?
It's this new guy. He's really good.

10
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,169
I'm sorry. I'm not going to an eye doctor.

11
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:48,422
- Oh, God. Here we go.
- What?

12
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,259
Any time anything comes close
to touching her eye or anyone else's...

13
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,553
...she, like, freaks out. Watch.

14
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,430
Ross, come on.

15
00:00:56,681 --> 00:01:00,225
All right, fine. I have a weird thing with
my eye. Can we not talk about it please?

16
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,894
All right.

17
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,440
Hey, Rach. You know that great song?
Um, "Me, myself and eye."

18
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,442
Aah! Monica. Come on.

19
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,528
Does anyone wanna get some lunch?
All those in favor, say "eye."

20
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,197
Ross, stop it. Come on.

21
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,325
How much did I love
The King and "Eye."

22
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,660
- Chandler.
- Me too, me too.

23
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,080
Just stop it. That's enough. Come on.

24
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,626
- You okay there, man?
- Yeah. I got too excited.

25
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,346
All right, I gotta go.
I'm taking Ben to the park.

26
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,515
- Oh, give him a kiss for me.
- All right. Bye.

27
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,808
- Bye.
- Bye.

28
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,476
Later.

29
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,855
I am so sorry you got caught
in the middle of that.

30
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:31,817
I didn't mean to be so out there,
but I am furious with him.

31
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,237
Wow, um...

32
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,030
Calm down?

33
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,451
I'm trying, but, man,
that guy can push my buttons.

34
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,288
Why are you so mad at him?

35
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,457
- Look, I don't wanna talk about it, okay?
- Well, it seems like...

36
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,127
You wanna be on my list too?
Keep talking.

37
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,339
Has anyone seen my list, by the way?

38
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,800
Uh, no. What's it look like?

39
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:00,012
- Um, a piece of paper and it says "Ross."
- I see.

40
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,432
Hey.

41
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,810
I just got off the phone with Estelle.
Guess what?

42
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,478
I got the lead in a movie.

43
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,648
You got the lead in a movie?
What's the movie about?

44
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,942
Oh, it's called Shutterspeed.
It's really cool.

45
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:19,406
Yeah, um, I meet this girl in the subway
and we fall in love in, like, a day, right?

46
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,743
And then she disappears.
But I find out where she lives.

47
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,622
And when I get there, this old lady
answers the door. I say, "Where's Betsy?"

48
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:32,252
Right? And she says,
"Betsy's been dead 10 years."

49
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,923
Ooh. Chilling.

50
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,760
Oh, and the best part is we're filming
in the desert outside of Vegas.

51
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,095
- You know what that means, buddy.
- Yeah, I know.

52
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:46,058
Road trip. Yeah, we can rent a car.
I just have to be there by Tuesday.

53
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,144
Oh, wait. My grandmother's dead.

54
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:57,069
Well, uh, we can talk about that too,
Pheebs.

55
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,278
No, no, her cab.

56
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,615
She probably won't be using it.
You could drive it to Las Vegas.

57
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,325
All right. Thanks, Pheebs.

58
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,411
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are we gonna do about my job?

59
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,623
- Oh, uh, not go.
- All right, great. Road trip, baby.

60
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,084
Is this okay with you?

61
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,712
Chandler, you don't have to ask
for my permission.

62
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,922
- You can go.
- Thank you.

63
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,842
Hey, Rach, come on, you're gonna
be late for the eye doctor.

64
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,180
All right. Let's get this over with. Ugh.

65
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,183
Oh, no.

66
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,478
Look what I did.

67
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,233
I mean, look at this mess.

68
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,860
I mean, we're gonna probably
have to clean this up, you know?

69
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,697
I mean, we're gonna have to reschedule.

70
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:46,952
If you thought that this mess
was gonna bother me, you are wrong.

71
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,037
All right, let's go, Blinky.

72
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,501
Chandler.

73
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,634
Oh, hey, Joey. What's up?

74
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,346
I can't decide which route
to take to Vegas.

75
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,432
Hey, you've traveled a lot, right?

76
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,309
- Yeah, I've been around.
- Okay.

77
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,854
So which route should I take?
The northern route or the southern route?

78
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,649
Ooh, if you take the north route, there's
a man in Illinois with a beard of bees.

79
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,279
Great. Problem solved.

80
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,533
But on the southern route,
there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.

81
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,037
Well, back to square one.

82
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,831
Oh, I know a way that you can decide.

83
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,417
All right, I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions...

84
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,294
...and you answer as quickly as you can.

85
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,963
- Yes.
- Good. But wait.

86
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,134
Here we go. I want you to relax.

87
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,386
Take a deep breath.

88
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,264
Clear your mind.
Which do you like better...

89
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,266
...peanut butter or egg whites?
- Peanut butter.

90
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,602
- Rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
- Swimmer.

91
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,397
- Rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
- Monica. Oh.

92
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,858
I always thought it'd be Rachel.

93
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,570
- No thinking, no thinking. Tie or ascot?
- Ascot.

94
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,238
- North route or south route?
- North.

95
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,741
- Bam, there you go. Huh?
- Wow.

96
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:12,412
That was incredible.
Beard of bees here I come.

97
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,209
- Hey.
- Oh, this guy again.

98
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,213
Hey, what's up?

99
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,757
Uh, not much.
You guys wanna see a movie tonight?

100
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,718
- Sure. What do you wanna see?
- I don't know. Um...

101
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,054
I know how we can decide.
Phoebe, show him your game.

102
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,181
Um, no, thank you.

103
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,226
What's with her?

104
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,603
I don't know.
But I know how we can decide.

105
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,940
Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions
and you answer real quick, okay?

106
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,775
- What's better, action or comedy?
- Action.

107
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,778
Who would you rather sleep with,
Monica or Rachel?

108
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,201
Dude, you are sick.

109
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:57,624
Oh. I'm sorry. I forgot you had
that whole Rachel thing.

110
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,174
Oh, my God. What does that thing do?

111
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,637
- Uh, that's an eye removal machine.
- All right, I'm out of here.

112
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,472
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

113
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,349
Hi, Rachel, I'm Dr. Miller.

114
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,853
Monica told me you were a little nervous,
but everything's gonna be just fine.

115
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:21,189
- So we're done then.
- Almost, but first we gotta start.

116
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,568
- This is the glaucoma test. Sit down.
- Uh-huh.

117
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,695
- Okay.
- Put your chin here.

118
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,530
Mm-hm.

119
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,491
Now, you'll feel a small puff of air
in each eye.

120
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,326
Uh, a what?

121
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:37,080
A small puff of air. Now, come on.

122
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,208
- Here we go.
- All right.

123
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,670
One, two, three.

124
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,046
Okay.

125
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,132
I'm sorry. All right.

126
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,010
Ha, ha, I'm gonna stay in here this time.
Okay.

127
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,344
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

128
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,473
- One, two...
- I'm sorry.

129
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,267
You know what?
I'm gonna hold her head.

130
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,644
- That's okay.
- Okay.

131
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:00,896
Okay.

132
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,230
- One...
- Uh-huh.

133
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,025
...two...
- Oh! I'm sorry.

134
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,487
You know what? You're young.
You probably don't have glaucoma.

135
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,531
I'm okay.

136
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,201
Okay, so it was very, very nice
to meet you, sir.

137
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:17,704
- Ow! Hey, what are you...? Are you crazy?
- Okay.

138
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:21,166
You got a small, minor infection
in that left eye.

139
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:25,086
I want you to take these drops for a week
and you'll be as good as new.

140
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,506
No, I don't put things in my eye.

141
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,425
Okay then. I guess we'll see you
back here in three months.

142
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,469
- Great.
- And I'll fit you for a glass eye.

143
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,304
Okay, just give me the damn drops.

144
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,516
Dr. Miller?

145
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,477
P-E-C-F-D.

146
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,439
Very good, Monica.

147
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,818
- You know where they are.
- I sure do.

148
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,532
And you don't get one.

149
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,581
You know, I gotta tell you,
those eye drops are a miracle.

150
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,625
My eye is 100 percent better.

151
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,127
- They're still in my coat.
- Damn.

152
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,964
- Hey.
- Hey, you ready to go?

153
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,632
Listen, how cold is it gonna be there?

154
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,176
Do I need a coat or will all these
sweater vests be enough?

155
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,596
- What?
- I love you.

156
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,893
Man, I wish Ross was coming with us.
I'm gonna miss him.

157
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,896
Thanks a lot. I just got
that jerk out of my mind.

158
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,442
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the
movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?

159
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,778
Uh, no, not really.
It's an independent film.

160
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,073
So we don't have a real big budget.
I figured I'd just stay in your room.

161
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,953
I see, but once you get your first paycheck,
you'll be springing for a suite.

162
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,205
Lead in the movie,
they must be paying you a lot.

163
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,458
Oh, yeah. Check this out.
For every dollar Shutterspeed makes...

164
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,878
...one penny of it
goes right in Joey's pocket.

165
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,048
So you don't get paid
unless the movie makes money?

166
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,760
Did you not hear the plot of the movie?

167
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,723
"She's been dead for 10 years."

168
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,017
I'm gonna be a millionaire.

169
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,144
- Hey.
- Hey.

170
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,021
I just wanted to say goodbye
to you guys.

171
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,691
And to see if maybe you guys
will place a little bet for me.

172
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,152
Twenty bucks on black 15.

173
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,903
- You got it.
- All right.

174
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,657
- All right. Bye-bye, now.
- Bye, you guys.

175
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,534
- I'm gonna say goodbye at the car.
- Okay.

176
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,996
Anybody wanna say
goodbye to me at the car?

177
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:27,334
Oh, honey, I'll say goodbye to you
at the car if you don't mind the pus.

178
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,795
See you.

179
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:35,592
But wait a minute. The pus is good.
It means it's healing.

180
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,848
Hey, Pheebs. What you reading?

181
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,226
Pheebs?

182
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,938
Hello?

183
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:55,278
Phoebe?

184
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,614
Come on.

185
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,616
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see you there.

186
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,913
Pheebs, are you mad at me
or something?

187
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,582
Because if you are,
please tell me what it is I did.

188
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,627
- Well, if you don't know, I can't help you.
- Well, I don't know.

189
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,712
Well, I can't help you.

190
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:18,468
Okay, well, whatever it is,
I am very, very sorry. Okay?

191
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,887
Apology accepted.

192
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,014
Okay.

193
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,392
- So we're good?
- Uh-huh.

194
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,894
All right.

195
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,523
I'll, uh, see you later, okay?

196
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,401
- Bye, fat ass.
- All right.

197
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,656
Phoebe, come on, will you please tell me
what it is that made you so mad at me?

198
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,659
I don't know. I don't remember.

199
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,247
Well, if you can't remember,
can't we just forget about this?

200
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,667
Oh, no. I am mad at you.
I know that much.

201
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,169
But I am sorry about the "fat ass" thing...

202
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,839
...because you actually have
a very sweet little heinie.

203
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:08,393
Man, I'm getting pretty tired.
You might have to take over soon.

204
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:12,981
We've been driving for a half-hour.
And you haven't looked at the road once.

205
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,441
Don't worry. It's out there.

206
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,154
- Maybe I just need lunch.
- Yeah.

207
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,323
You wanna eat? My treat.

208
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,285
Isn't that Ross' money?

209
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,495
Yeah, okay.

210
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,123
Ross' treat.
Where do you wanna eat?

211
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,418
- I don't know.
- Oh, hey, I know how we can decide.

212
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,545
All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you
questions...

213
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,797
...and then you have to answer
real fast, okay?

214
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,300
So, uh, clear your mind.
Clear it right out. Clear it out.

215
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,885
Okay.

216
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:45,555
- Would you rather be too wet or too dry?
- Too dry.

217
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,265
- Do you believe in ghosts?
- No.

218
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,684
- Is this movie gonna be my big break?
- No.

219
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,813
- What?
- Yes.

220
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,108
- Dude, you said no.
- I also said yes.

221
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,319
You don't think this is gonna be
a big break for me?

222
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,528
No.

223
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,949
I don't believe this.

224
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,745
Look, Joe, I just don't want you
to get your hopes up too high.

225
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,956
What are you talking about?
I'm the lead in a movie.

226
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:16,336
They're not even paying you.
This doesn't even sound like a real movie.

227
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,589
You know, I don't know why
you're dumping all over my big break.

228
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,550
Because, Joe, I don't think
this is going to be your big break.

229
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,553
Is that why you're on this trip? Huh?
To make me feel like a loser?

230
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,640
- Because if it is, I'd rather be alone.
- You don't want me on the trip?

231
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,183
Not if you're like this.

232
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,478
Tell you what, the next time
you ask me a question like that, I'll lie.

233
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,438
Yeah, I don't want you on the trip.

234
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,191
All right, fine.
Why don't you pull over? I'll get out now.

235
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,609
Fine.

236
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,404
Get out.

237
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,406
You're not supposed to stop
on a bridge.

238
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,450
- Get out.
- Fine.

239
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,914
Wait. Wait. There's no sidewalk.

240
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,583
Yeah. I'm gonna die here.

241
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,214
Okay, are you mad at me
because my hair gel smells?

242
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,674
No.

243
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:06,970
Are you angry with me because I said
your handwriting is childlike?

244
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,514
No, that made me feel precious.

245
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,268
Oh, I know. Is it because he's always
correcting people's grammar?

246
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,771
You know, "whom, whom."
Sometimes it's "who."

247
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,191
Yeah? Sometimes it's...

248
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,654
Oh, did you beat him at a board game?

249
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,282
He turns into such a baby
when he starts to lose.

250
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,660
- Okay, I'm the baby.
- Hey. Stop it.

251
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,414
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

252
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,083
Joey kicked me out of the car
on the bridge.

253
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,377
- Why?
- I don't know. He went crazy.

254
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:43,131
We were playing that game where you
ask a question and have to answer fast.

255
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,759
Oh, that game should not be played
without my supervision.

256
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,637
Well, I don't know what made him mad.

257
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,849
All I said was that, uh, I didn't think
this was gonna be his big break...

258
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,143
...that this movie wasn't gonna
do anything for him...

259
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,145
...and that it didn't sound
like a real movie.

260
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,148
Okay, he should've
pushed me off the bridge.

261
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,399
What's in the bag?

262
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,401
Oh, I figured you guys
would all be mad at me...

263
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,321
...so I got you some gifts
that I found on the side of the road.

264
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,324
- Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
- I do.

265
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,704
Okay.

266
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,712
- Not even close.
- Okay, well, help me. I can't do this.

267
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,255
All right, come on. Let's do it.

268
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,049
- All right.
- Sit down.

269
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,218
- All right, put your head back. All right.
- Yes. Okay.

270
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,805
- Now, open your eyes.
- Okay, they are.

271
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,101
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- Four.

272
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,603
Oh, my God, I was thinking four.

273
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,897
- Really?
- Yes.

274
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,108
All right, why don't we start
with a practice one, okay?

275
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,569
- No drops.
- Great.

276
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,574
On three. One, two, three.

277
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,910
My pillow's all wet.

278
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,120
Well, you said it was practice.

279
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,998
- Then why did you move?
- Because I knew you were lying.

280
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,252
- All right. Come here. Come on.
- What are you doing? Monica.

281
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,588
Stop it! Oh, my God, stop it.

282
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,674
I am going...

283
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,717
- Turn it over.
- Aah!

284
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,886
I am going to get...

285
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,014
Get these drops in your eye.

286
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,476
Oh, my God.
You really are freakishly strong.

287
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,064
Aah! Aah! Monica, stop it!

288
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,067
Damn, it's empty.

289
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,446
Wow. If Joey and Chandler walked in
right now, we could make a fortune.

290
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,372
Ooh, that is definitely Chandler,
Joey or Ross.

291
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:40,999
Or Rachel.

292
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,920
Hello? It's Joey.

293
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,718
I'm so glad you called. Chandler told me
what happened. He's really upset.

294
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:56,764
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he
finds out what I did with his sweater vests.

295
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,226
What did you do to his sweater vests?

296
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,104
Let's just say there's a well-dressed
pack of dogs in Ohio.

297
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,402
Monica, listen, is Phoebe there?
I gotta ask her something about the car.

298
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,029
Yeah, hold on one second.

299
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,781
- Hey, dude.
- Hey, Pheebs.

300
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,409
Listen, this wooden box
keeps sliding out from under the seat.

301
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,161
- What is it?
- Oh, that's my grandma.

302
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,584
And thanks, Joey.
She's having a really great time.

303
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,130
Is that Joey? Is that Joey?
Let me talk to him.

304
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,215
Joey, Chandler's here.
He was wondering if...

305
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,636
Okay, I guess he ran out of change.

306
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,388
He won't even talk to me.

307
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,224
How am I gonna apologize to him
if he won't even talk to me?

308
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,018
Maybe you should send him something.

309
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,604
So when he gets to Las Vegas,
he'll know that you're sorry.

310
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:49,192
That's a good idea. I wonder where
I could get a basket of porn?

311
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,820
Oh, no, don't say I'm sorry with porn.

312
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,532
You know what you should send him?
A carton of cigarettes.

313
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,743
Because that way he can trade it
for protection.

314
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,370
No. That's prison.

315
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,083
Okay, Pheebs.

316
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,085
I know how we're gonna figure this out.

317
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,212
Okay. Clear your mind...

318
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,924
...and answer the first thing
that comes into your head. Okay?

319
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,217
Mm-hm.

320
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,677
- What's better, flora or fauna?
- Fauna.

321
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,387
- Simon or Garfunkel?
- Garfunkel.

322
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,265
- Why are you mad at me?
- You said I was boring. Oh.

323
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,770
When did I say you were boring?

324
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:29,065
Oh, my God, I remember now.
We were playing chess.

325
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,235
Phoebe, you and I
have never played chess.

326
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,486
Oh, come on. Yes.

327
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:37,615
Remember that time on the frozen lake?
We were playing. You said I was boring.

328
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,744
And then you took off your energy mask
and you were Cameron Diaz.

329
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,333
Okay, there's a chance
this may have been a dream.

330
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:19,073
Hey. Stanley. Hey.

331
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,033
Your leading man is here.
Let's get to work.

332
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:25,371
Um, slight change of plans.
We've shut down.

333
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,498
What? Why?

334
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,001
It's a money thing. We don't have any.

335
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,755
- Ha, ha. You're kidding, right?
- No.

336
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,926
- What?
- It's probably just temporary.

337
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,471
We're hoping to get more money soon,
so if you could just, uh, hang out.

338
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,640
Hang out? How long?

339
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:48,561
I don't know. A week. Maybe two.
The money'll turn up.

340
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,190
People always wanna invest in movies.
Hey, you're not rich, are you?

341
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,192
- No.
- Worth a shot.

342
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,322
Well, Joey, let me know
where you're staying, okay?

343
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,577
- Hey, pal. Are you Joey Tribbiani?
- Yeah.

344
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,245
These got left for you.

345
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,080
Thanks.

346
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,877
"Congratulations on your big break."

347
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:44,992
Hello?

348
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,828
- Monica, it's Joey.
- Hey, Joey.

349
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,414
Aw, you remember me
even though you're a big star.

350
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,960
Aw, come on.
It'll be years before I forget you.

351
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,755
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh?

352
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,758
Do you have a dressing room?
Do you have a chair with your name on it?

353
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,802
Uh, yeah, yeah, I got all that going on.

354
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,056
Listen, uh, make sure you tell Chandler
he couldn't have been more wrong.

355
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:10,726
Uh-oh, I gotta go, Monica.
My, uh, sushi's here.

356
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,775
Sorry about that.
Thanks for waiting. Okay.

357
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,819
Everybody smile.

358
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,988
Okay.

359
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:27,118
Thanks a lot. Enjoy your stay at Caesar's.
We hope it's toga-rific.

360
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,289
Ugh. Kill me. Kill me now.

361
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,089
- Hey, Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
- Yeah.

362
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,716
- Go!
- Aah!

363
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:45,303
What are you doing?
Get off! Oh, my God!

364
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,638
- Hold it open. Okay.
- Aah!

365
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,314
We'll see you in about
three or four hours.
