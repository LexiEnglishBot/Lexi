1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,994
Hey, you guys? What are
you doing tomorrow night?

2
00:00:06,161 --> 00:00:09,414
Oh, well, let me see.
I believe I'm...

3
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:11,749
Yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.

4
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:16,129
Well, my agent hooked me up
with six tickets to a great play.

5
00:00:16,296 --> 00:00:17,922
I could fall asleep at a play.

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,134
- What is it?
- It's a one-woman play called:

7
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:24,304
Why Don '2' You Like Me?
A Bitter Woman's Journey Through Life.

8
00:00:24,471 --> 00:00:25,513
Ooh.

9
00:00:26,014 --> 00:00:28,683
- That sounds interesting.
- That does sound interesting.

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,145
To listen to a woman complain for
two hours. I don't think it gets bet...

11
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:38,318
I know! I know. We can drive.
We can vote. We can work.

12
00:00:38,485 --> 00:00:40,987
What more do these broads want?

13
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:44,324
Well, you guys will have a great time.
I promise.

14
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:46,242
What? How come you don't have to go?

15
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:47,994
I wish I could, but I found out...

16
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:51,664
...that I have to be at work really
early the next day, so I can't go.

17
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:54,459
But take the extra ticket
and invite whoever you want.

18
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:57,545
Ooh. Let's see. Who do I hate?

19
00:00:59,797 --> 00:01:01,174
Oh, sorry.

20
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:02,967
- Oops, sorry.
- Okay.

21
00:01:03,134 --> 00:01:04,719
- Okay.
- Okay. Up you 90-

22
00:01:04,886 --> 00:01:07,096
- Oh, gosh, okay!
- All right.

23
00:01:16,731 --> 00:01:19,734
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:23,279
Do you think it's possible
for two friends to fool around...

25
00:01:23,446 --> 00:01:26,658
...and not have it be a big deal?

26
00:01:28,076 --> 00:01:30,578
No, I don't think that ever works.
Why?

27
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:33,248
- No reason.
- No, no. Rachel?

28
00:01:33,414 --> 00:01:35,416
- Yeah.
- Who do you want to fool around with?

29
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:38,044
Nobody! Forget it.

30
00:01:38,294 --> 00:01:39,337
Joey?

31
00:01:40,255 --> 00:01:41,881
Maybe.

32
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:44,551
- You can't.
- Why?

33
00:01:44,717 --> 00:01:45,927
Because.

34
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,892
Okay, seriously,
did not understand a word you just said.

35
00:01:53,935 --> 00:01:56,187
- In the hall.
- Okay.

36
00:01:58,856 --> 00:02:00,733
- You wanna fool around with Joey?
- Yeah.

37
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,445
Ever since I had that dream about him,
I can't get it out of my head.

38
00:02:04,612 --> 00:02:07,240
I mean, what's the big deal?
People do it all the time.

39
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:10,076
Who do you know that are friends
that just fool around?

40
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:14,497
Okay. Off the top of my head...
Don and Janet.

41
00:02:14,664 --> 00:02:17,333
- Who are they?
- I know them from work.

42
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:20,295
- Both of them?
- No, just one of them.

43
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:22,255
Which one?

44
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:25,341
I don't know.
What were the names I just said?

45
00:02:25,508 --> 00:02:28,303
No, Rachel, things could get
incredibly complicated.

46
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:31,931
You're right. I won't do anything
with Joey. I just thought it...

47
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:36,936
Okay, so that's two cups of tarragon,
a pound of baking soda and a red onion?

48
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:40,106
What the hell are you cooking?

49
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:34,160
- Hey.
- Hey.

50
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:37,205
You guys won't believe
what I have to do for work today.

51
00:03:37,372 --> 00:03:41,918
Yes, but, Ross, you chose a career
of talking about dinosaurs.

52
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:46,506
There are these two professors
who are joining my department...

53
00:03:47,215 --> 00:03:50,718
...and I have to meet them here
and show them around campus.

54
00:03:50,885 --> 00:03:52,011
What's bad about that?

55
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:54,889
I just know they'll be
a couple of old windbags...

56
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:58,601
...wearing tweed jackets
with suede elbow patches.

57
00:03:59,602 --> 00:04:00,687
Ross?

58
00:04:00,853 --> 00:04:03,523
What? These aren't suede.

59
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:10,196
Excuse me. I'm looking for someone.

60
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:13,408
You don't, by any chance,
know a Ross Geller?

61
00:04:13,574 --> 00:04:14,617
No.

62
00:04:18,246 --> 00:04:21,457
Hi. Hi, I'm Ross Geller.

63
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:25,128
- Oh, hi. I'm Professor Wheeler.
- Oh.

64
00:04:25,586 --> 00:04:28,840
Oh, that's... That's...
That's nice.

65
00:04:29,507 --> 00:04:30,842
It's good to meet you.

66
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:33,886
Thank you so much for taking the time
to show me around.

67
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:35,888
No, it's no big deal.

68
00:04:36,055 --> 00:04:40,393
If I weren't doing this, I'd just,
you know, be at the gym working out.

69
00:04:41,477 --> 00:04:42,729
Is he gonna introduce us?

70
00:04:42,895 --> 00:04:46,232
I think we're just blurry shapes
to him now.

71
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,402
By the way,
I really enjoyed your paper...

72
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:53,030
...on the connection between geographic
isolation and rapid mutagenesis.

73
00:04:53,197 --> 00:04:57,160
I wrote that in one night.

74
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,414
Twenty bucks says they're married
within the month.

75
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:04,709
Well, we should probably get going.

76
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:07,670
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

77
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:10,548
Isn't another professor
supposed to come with us?

78
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,426
I don't think so.

79
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:16,429
I'm pretty sure.
A Professor Spafford from Cornell?

80
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:19,682
Well, he's obviously late,
and the rule in my class is:

81
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:23,811
If you can't come on time,
then don't come at all.

82
00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:27,148
An option that many of my students use.

83
00:05:28,024 --> 00:05:30,109
- Shall we?
- We shouldn't wait for him?

84
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:33,529
You know what, he's a big boy.
I'm sure he'll find us, okay?

85
00:05:33,696 --> 00:05:36,073
- Professor Geller?
- Oh, damn it!

86
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:49,462
Hi, it's Jan Rogers.
Can't wait for your party tonight.

87
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:54,258
Listen, I forgot your address.
Can you give me a call? Thanks. Bye.

88
00:05:55,676 --> 00:05:57,553
- Hey!
- Hey!

89
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,888
What's happening?

90
00:05:59,138 --> 00:06:03,351
It's a real shame you can't make it
to that one-woman show tonight.

91
00:06:03,518 --> 00:06:06,562
I'd love to, but I gotta get up
so early the next day.

92
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:10,441
- You know me, work comes first.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

93
00:06:11,943 --> 00:06:15,488
Hi, it's Jan Rogers.
Can't wait for your party tonight.

94
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:19,575
Stupid Jan Rogers!

95
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:22,578
You are having a party tonight?

96
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,290
I'm kind of having a thing
for the Days of our Lives people.

97
00:06:26,457 --> 00:06:27,834
You weren't gonna tell us?

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,419
How did you think
you'd get away with that?

99
00:06:30,586 --> 00:06:32,421
I do it every year.

100
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:36,092
You do that every year?!

101
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:38,427
I didn't have to tell you that!

102
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:41,472
God, I'm stupider than Jan Rogers!

103
00:06:42,473 --> 00:06:45,685
That's why you got us tickets
to that play, to get rid of us!

104
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:46,936
Yeah.

105
00:06:47,103 --> 00:06:50,565
Last year is that why you sent us
to that Medieval Times restaurant?

106
00:06:50,731 --> 00:06:51,941
Yeah.

107
00:06:52,817 --> 00:06:57,446
The year before that, you set up that
nighttime tour of that button factory?

108
00:06:57,613 --> 00:06:59,782
I can't believe you guys went
for that one.

109
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:03,160
Why wouldn't you invite us
to your parties?

110
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:07,665
You're fine, okay? But everyone else acts
like an idiot around famous people.

111
00:07:07,832 --> 00:07:10,710
Well, then, so just invite me.

112
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:14,547
Please, I was trying to be nice.
You're the worst one.

113
00:07:14,714 --> 00:07:18,718
Joey, come on! Please, please?
Let me come. I will behave. I promise.

114
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:22,388
- I will behave. Please, please, please.
- Okay, fine. You can come.

115
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:26,183
But don't tell anybody else.
It's up on the roof at 8.

116
00:07:26,434 --> 00:07:27,935
A soap-opera roof party?!

117
00:07:28,102 --> 00:07:31,772
I'm going to a soap-opera roof party!
Uh, my God! Oh, my God!

118
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:36,527
And it's out of my system.

119
00:07:42,158 --> 00:07:47,747
And then my wife and I went
on a cruise to the Galépagos.

120
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:52,126
There was a seafood buffet
you wouldn't believe.

121
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:57,423
There were clams and mussels
and oysters...

122
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,884
...and cracked crab...

123
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:02,219
...and snow crab...

124
00:08:02,386 --> 00:08:04,889
...and king crab.

125
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:08,184
It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.

126
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:12,688
So where did you get
your undergraduate degree?

127
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:16,609
- And that's not all I'm allergic to.
- Oh, it's not over.

128
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:20,905
I'm also allergic to peanuts
and cashews...

129
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:23,240
...and almonds and filberts...

130
00:08:23,407 --> 00:08:25,076
So basically all nuts!

131
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:27,495
Interestingly, no.

132
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:32,166
You're kind of playing it fast and loose
with the word "interesting."

133
00:08:33,876 --> 00:08:37,546
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to use the restroom.

134
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:40,383
Oh, my God!

135
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,718
I've lost the will to live.

136
00:08:44,428 --> 00:08:45,930
- Let's ditch him.
- What?

137
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:48,808
While he's still in the bathroom.
I am begging you.

138
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:52,770
Okay. Okay, fine,
but I just have one question for you.

139
00:08:52,937 --> 00:08:56,023
When we exit, should we walk or run...

140
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,567
...or prance or stroll...?

141
00:08:58,734 --> 00:09:03,572
Stop it! Stop it! He talks slow,
but he might pee fast. Okay, let's move!

142
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,543
Oh, hey, you guys, this is Charlie.

143
00:09:15,793 --> 00:09:18,629
Charlie, this is Phoebe
and my sister, Monica.

144
00:09:18,796 --> 00:09:21,966
- Hi.
- Charlie will be joining my department.

145
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,301
- You're a paleontologist too?
- Yeah.

146
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:26,679
Oh, okay. Now, what do you think...

147
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:31,183
...of Renyard's new theory of species
variegation in segmented arthropods?

148
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,397
I think he's a little out there,
but he does have some interesting ideas.

149
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:41,402
Oh, I'm sorry. I have to take this.
Excuse me.

150
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:44,280
Renyard's theory of species variegation?

151
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:49,618
I saw the article on your coffee table.
I memorized the title to freak you out.

152
00:09:51,787 --> 00:09:53,456
So did you two have fun?

153
00:09:53,622 --> 00:09:56,083
Oh, my God. She's great.

154
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,546
We have so much in common, and she's
just cool, you know? And funny.

155
00:10:00,713 --> 00:10:04,425
And I don't know if you've noticed,
but she's a hottie!

156
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:05,801
Hi!

157
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:11,766
- Hey.
- Hey.

158
00:10:11,932 --> 00:10:15,728
Hi, you guys. Listen, you know what,
I'm not feeling really well...

159
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:19,315
...and I don't think I'm gonna get
to go to the play.

160
00:10:19,482 --> 00:10:20,816
Really? What's wrong?

161
00:10:20,983 --> 00:10:23,194
I don't know.
I think it's kind of serious.

162
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,822
You know, I was watching this thing
on TV this morning...

163
00:10:26,989 --> 00:10:31,243
...about Newcastle disease,
and I think I might have it.

164
00:10:31,619 --> 00:10:34,121
Newcastle disease is
a secretion-borne virus...

165
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:37,041
...that only affects chickens
and other poultry.

166
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,961
Okay, who's this?

167
00:10:41,504 --> 00:10:44,840
I'm sorry. Rachel, this is Charlie Wheeler.
She's a colleague.

168
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:46,926
Hi. Well, I would shake your hand...

169
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:50,387
...but I'm sure you don't want
to get my chicken disease.

170
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,141
- Rachel, can I see you for a second?
- Sure.

171
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:00,606
You're not sick.

172
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,733
What? Yes, I am!

173
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,361
Okay, then why are you all dressed up?

174
00:11:07,488 --> 00:11:11,408
When you're sick, you do whatever
you can to make yourself feel better.

175
00:11:12,993 --> 00:11:16,288
You just want to stay home
so you can make a move on Joey.

176
00:11:16,455 --> 00:11:19,250
No, I heard you before.
That is so not what this is.

177
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,669
Okay, then what is this?

178
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:23,379
Okay.

179
00:11:24,463 --> 00:11:27,633
Joey is having a secret
Days of our Lives party up on the roof.

180
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,344
And he sent you guys to the play
to get rid of you.

181
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:32,513
What?!

182
00:11:33,347 --> 00:11:34,598
What? What's going on?

183
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:38,394
Joey is having a secret
Days of our Lives party up on the roof!

184
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:42,982
He didn't want you to know about it,
but I came over here to tell you.

185
00:11:43,566 --> 00:11:47,111
- You came to say you were sick.
- All right, professor or detective?

186
00:11:48,195 --> 00:11:51,824
Wait, Joey's having a party,
and he wasn't gonna invite us?

187
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:55,578
He does it every year.
That's why he's sending you to the play.

188
00:11:55,744 --> 00:11:59,957
That's why he sent us to that medieval
restaurant and to that button factory.

189
00:12:00,124 --> 00:12:02,376
And that horrible museum tour?

190
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,503
No, I arranged that.

191
00:12:08,507 --> 00:12:11,302
Hey, you guys, I'm turning in.
Have fun.

192
00:12:14,722 --> 00:12:16,432
We know about your party, Joey.

193
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:20,102
- What party?
- The game's over. Take off your robe.

194
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,063
Okay, I mean...

195
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:25,441
No!

196
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:28,986
Close it up! Close it up!

197
00:12:30,988 --> 00:12:32,323
Nice to meet you.

198
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:44,293
Hey, you made it! All right!

199
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,670
Glad you could make it.
Thanks for coming.

200
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:50,007
- Oh, my God. Kyle Lowder!
- Hi.

201
00:12:50,674 --> 00:12:52,426
I love you!

202
00:12:52,593 --> 00:12:56,263
Hey. That's why I didn't invite you.
You have to calm down, all right?

203
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,432
Just get yourself a drink
or something.

204
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:01,477
Oh, yeah, that's what you want.
My inhibitions lowered.

205
00:13:01,685 --> 00:13:02,728
Hey.

206
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:05,314
My God, can you believe
we're surrounded by all this?

207
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:07,024
I can barely control myself.

208
00:13:07,191 --> 00:13:09,818
You might want to remember
that you're married.

209
00:13:09,985 --> 00:13:12,238
Where is Chandler anyway?

210
00:13:12,404 --> 00:13:13,989
Oh, my God! Chandler!

211
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:23,332
Where the hell is everybody?

212
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:28,170
Why Don '2' You Like Me?

213
00:13:32,132 --> 00:13:35,386
Chapter 1: My First Period.

214
00:13:39,974 --> 00:13:42,059
Hey, Joey said no autographs.

215
00:13:42,226 --> 00:13:44,353
But if she's getting one,
I want one too!

216
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,649
"To Monica." And none of this
"best wishes" crap. I want "love."

217
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,862
Okay, actually, Mon, Matthew was
giving me his phone number.

218
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:56,824
Oh, man! If I had known
I was coming to this party...

219
00:13:56,991 --> 00:13:58,867
...I never would've gotten married!

220
00:14:00,035 --> 00:14:02,121
- It was nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

221
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:04,373
- Call me.
- We will!

222
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,169
- Look at you with all the guys!
- Yeah.

223
00:14:09,336 --> 00:14:10,713
I guess you've forgotten Joey.

224
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:13,674
Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten
aboutJoey.

225
00:14:13,841 --> 00:14:16,218
And clearly, you've forgotten
about Chandler.

226
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:19,346
Please. Chandler's
the love of my life.

227
00:14:19,513 --> 00:14:21,598
Oh, leather pants! Have mercy!

228
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:28,564
So it's probably gonna be hard
for you to leave Boston, huh?

229
00:14:28,731 --> 00:14:32,609
Actually, I'm kind of happy to be leaving.
I just broke up with someone.

230
00:14:32,776 --> 00:14:35,029
Oh, so sad.

231
00:14:35,571 --> 00:14:38,282
Still, it can't be easy
for you to leave Harvard.

232
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:42,536
Especially after working with a Nobel
Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer.

233
00:14:42,953 --> 00:14:45,748
Actually, Albie is the guy
I broke up with.

234
00:14:45,914 --> 00:14:49,043
- You dated Albert Wintermeyer?
- Yeah.

235
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:52,129
And you called him "Albie"?

236
00:14:52,963 --> 00:14:57,176
I mean, that's like calling
Albert Einstein...

237
00:14:57,968 --> 00:14:59,011
Albie.

238
00:15:00,846 --> 00:15:03,057
Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.

239
00:15:03,223 --> 00:15:05,392
You think?
I mean, you dated the guy...

240
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:09,021
...who improved the accuracy
of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!

241
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:13,525
Yes, and while that is everything
one looks for in a boyfriend...

242
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:15,361
...he had a lot of issues.

243
00:15:15,527 --> 00:15:17,404
Oh, like what?

244
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,949
I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry.
It's just that this must be...

245
00:15:21,116 --> 00:15:25,287
...what regular people experience
when they watch Access Hollywood.

246
00:15:25,746 --> 00:15:27,498
Okay, you want the dirt?

247
00:15:27,664 --> 00:15:29,792
Albie was seriously insecure.

248
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:33,170
He was really intimidated by the guy
I dated before him.

249
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:36,757
Who's intimidating to a guy
who won the Nobel Prize?

250
00:15:36,924 --> 00:15:38,926
A guy who won two.

251
00:15:39,468 --> 00:15:40,761
Two? What...?

252
00:15:40,928 --> 00:15:43,889
Don't tell me you dated
Benjamin Hobart?

253
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:45,933
Yeah, for three years.

254
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,476
Oh, my God.

255
00:15:48,352 --> 00:15:52,648
Have you ever dated someone
who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?

256
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:55,776
No.

257
00:15:56,568 --> 00:15:58,695
But there was
my first boyfriend, Billy.

258
00:15:58,862 --> 00:16:01,198
Oh, yeah? No Nobel Prizes for him?

259
00:16:01,365 --> 00:16:04,660
No, but he did just win
a MacArthur "genius grant."

260
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,663
What a loser.

261
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:11,125
Some more wine?

262
00:16:15,295 --> 00:16:17,714
Hey, Ross. How's it going
with Charlie?

263
00:16:17,881 --> 00:16:19,758
Oh, great. After I finish my wine...

264
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:23,846
...I'm gonna blow
my average-sized brains out.

265
00:16:24,304 --> 00:16:25,597
What's the matter?

266
00:16:25,764 --> 00:16:30,394
She only dates geniuses
and Nobel Prize winners.

267
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:33,355
Oh, my God, at the Chinese restaurant
earlier today...

268
00:16:33,522 --> 00:16:37,860
...I put chopsticks in my mouth
and pretended to be a woolly mammoth.

269
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,279
I always loved that.

270
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:43,949
Of course you would!
Your brains are smaller than mine!

271
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:48,120
I can't compete with the guys
she goes out with.

272
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:50,831
They're so out of my league.

273
00:16:51,331 --> 00:16:52,458
Oh, my God!

274
00:16:52,624 --> 00:16:54,585
- Worse?
- Oh, much, much worse.

275
00:16:54,751 --> 00:16:58,922
I did my impression of Joan Rivers
as one of the earliest amphibians.

276
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:00,215
"Can we walk?"

277
00:17:02,426 --> 00:17:04,720
- Oh, you like that?
- No.

278
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:06,138
What?

279
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:09,641
Come on! I think that's funny!

280
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:11,935
Woolly mammoth.

281
00:17:12,102 --> 00:17:13,812
L'I'S good!

282
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:20,110
I bet you're thinking that now would be
a great time for an intermission, huh?

283
00:17:20,277 --> 00:17:22,905
Oh, yes. God, yes.

284
00:17:23,489 --> 00:17:25,407
Well, you're not gonna get one!

285
00:17:25,574 --> 00:17:28,994
Because in life, there are
no intermissions, people!

286
00:17:30,245 --> 00:17:34,041
Now, Chapter 7:
Divorce is a Four-Letter Word!

287
00:17:35,876 --> 00:17:38,337
How could he leave me?!

288
00:17:40,088 --> 00:17:42,758
I don't know. You seem lovely.

289
00:17:49,723 --> 00:17:53,977
Ross, this is one of my costars, Dirk.
Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.

290
00:17:54,144 --> 00:17:56,563
- Nice to meet you.
- So, what show are you on?

291
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,108
I'm not an actor.
I'm a professor of paleontology.

292
00:18:00,943 --> 00:18:02,694
- That's science.
- Oh.

293
00:18:03,237 --> 00:18:05,989
Hey, well, listen,
I play a scientist on Days.

294
00:18:06,156 --> 00:18:09,034
Yeah, my character just won
a Nobel Prize.

295
00:18:10,953 --> 00:18:15,874
Dirk was wondering about the woman
you brought and if you two are together?

296
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,293
Oh. Well, no, but...

297
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,381
I mean, she only goes out
with really, really smart guys.

298
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:25,676
Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.

299
00:18:27,386 --> 00:18:28,971
I'd lead with that.

300
00:18:31,265 --> 00:18:34,059
That's it. Just sign right on the bra.

301
00:18:34,935 --> 00:18:35,978
Monica!

302
00:18:36,478 --> 00:18:39,690
Don't worry, Joe.
I won't come next year!

303
00:18:43,735 --> 00:18:44,987
What the...?

304
00:18:45,153 --> 00:18:46,446
What do you got there?

305
00:18:46,613 --> 00:18:49,116
Just some boys gave me
their phone numbers.

306
00:18:49,283 --> 00:18:51,535
- Oh, really? Let me see.
- Oh.

307
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:54,746
Damn, that's a lot of guys.

308
00:18:54,913 --> 00:18:57,207
Are you a little slutty?

309
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,169
I think I am.

310
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,381
Let me see if I approve
of any of these clowns.

311
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:06,800
- This guy wears a rug.
- Well...

312
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:09,386
This guy's Canadian.

313
00:19:09,886 --> 00:19:12,472
Oh, and this guy is in a cult, okay?

314
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:17,394
It'll cost you $5000 to get to level three,
and I don't feel any different.

315
00:19:18,979 --> 00:19:21,064
Pass. Pa... Oh, pass. Pass.

316
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:24,443
- Why? What's wrong with these guys?
- Well, nothing major.

317
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:28,030
It's just that, you know,
they're not really good enough for you...

318
00:19:28,196 --> 00:19:30,407
...and you deserve the best.

319
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:32,826
Joey, you're so sweet.

320
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:37,372
It's true, but it doesn't matter. I already
know who you're going home with.

321
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:39,249
Who?

322
00:19:42,794 --> 00:19:44,129
Me.

323
00:19:44,338 --> 00:19:45,922
What?

324
00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:48,258
Really?

325
00:19:48,592 --> 00:19:51,762
Yeah, because we live together.
It's a joke! It's a joke.

326
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:54,222
Right! That's funny! I get it!

327
00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:57,309
- Got you!
- You're funny, Joey.

328
00:19:57,809 --> 00:19:59,561
Oh, my God.

329
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:08,362
So how did you enjoy the play?

330
00:20:08,862 --> 00:20:13,742
Oh, my God.
Honey, I am so, so, so, so sorry.

331
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:14,951
You should be.

332
00:20:15,118 --> 00:20:19,331
You missed the most powerful
three hours in the history of the theater.

333
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:22,668
- You really liked it?
- Oh, yeah. I mean, at first I hated it.

334
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:27,047
But why wouldn't I? Because as a man,
I've been trained not to listen!

335
00:20:30,008 --> 00:20:35,180
But after Chapter 16:
Fat, Single and Ready to Mingle...

336
00:20:36,056 --> 00:20:38,183
...I was uplifted.

337
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:40,352
- Oh, really?
- Oh, yeah.

338
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:43,772
I had no idea the amazing journey
you go through as a woman.

339
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:47,901
Tell me...
Tell me about your first period.

340
00:20:49,653 --> 00:20:50,904
No!

341
00:20:52,656 --> 00:20:54,282
Did somebody sign your bra?

342
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:58,453
So I got it when I was 13.
Very difficult.

343
00:20:59,663 --> 00:21:04,334
Hey, Ross? So listen,
about you and the dinosaur girl?

344
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:08,171
Are you really just gonna let
a couple of Nobel Prizes scare you off?

345
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:10,674
What is that?
Come on, a piece of paper?

346
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:12,926
It's actually a million-dollar prize.

347
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:15,262
Go, Charlie!

348
00:21:15,804 --> 00:21:18,181
But my point is...

349
00:21:18,348 --> 00:21:22,269
...okay, so she dated them,
but she also broke up with them.

350
00:21:22,436 --> 00:21:28,024
Maybe she's looking to, you know,
slum it with some average Joe Ph.D.

351
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,989
Yeah, maybe, and I do have
my whole career in front of me.

352
00:21:34,156 --> 00:21:35,615
I mean...

353
00:21:35,782 --> 00:21:38,702
I could still win a Nobel Prize.

354
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:44,708
Although the last two papers
I've written were widely discredited.

355
00:21:46,543 --> 00:21:51,590
You're so much more than just brains.
You are sweet and kind and funny.

356
00:21:51,882 --> 00:21:53,258
And sexy.

357
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:56,553
Okay, well, give her a chance
to see all that.

358
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,889
Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

359
00:21:59,055 --> 00:22:01,600
- Thanks. I'm gonna go find her.
- Good for you.

360
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:06,688
Your paper on punctuated equilibrium
in the Devonian Era was topnotch.

361
00:22:06,855 --> 00:22:08,857
Stop going through my stuff!

362
00:22:11,943 --> 00:22:13,195
- Hey.
- Hey.

363
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:16,198
I just wanted to let you know
I've changed my mind.

364
00:22:16,364 --> 00:22:18,408
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna kiss Joey.

365
00:22:18,575 --> 00:22:22,037
No! You can't!
Friends hooking up is a bad idea.

366
00:22:22,204 --> 00:22:24,247
Please! What about you and Chandler?

367
00:22:24,414 --> 00:22:27,375
That's different.
I was drunk and stupid.

368
00:22:27,542 --> 00:22:29,878
Well, hello?

369
00:22:30,796 --> 00:22:34,257
What about all the guys that you got
the phone numbers from?

370
00:22:34,424 --> 00:22:37,010
- Why don't you just kiss one of them.
- I could...

371
00:22:37,177 --> 00:22:40,722
...but I don't want to.
I want to kiss Joey.

372
00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:45,393
All right. I think it's a big mistake,
but it's your decision.

373
00:22:50,148 --> 00:22:51,274
I'm gonna do it.

374
00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:54,361
- And I can't stop you?
- No.

375
00:23:07,457 --> 00:23:10,710
Hey, Rach, have you seen
Charlie anywhere?

376
00:23:16,466 --> 00:23:18,844
I'm smarter than him!

377
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,478
Hey, thank you so much
for these tickets, Chandler.

378
00:23:28,645 --> 00:23:33,024
This was a really important experience
for me. I wanted to share it with you.

379
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:34,985
You're so wonderful.

380
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:38,405
Why Don '2' You Like Me?

381
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:43,285
Chapter 1: My First Period.

382
00:23:45,287 --> 00:23:48,790
I can't believe you guys bought that.
Enjoy your slow death.
