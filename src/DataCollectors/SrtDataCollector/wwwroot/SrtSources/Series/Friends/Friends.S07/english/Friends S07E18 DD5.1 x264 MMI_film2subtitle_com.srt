1
00:00:02,226 --> 00:00:06,259
So, Pheebs, I was just at this
bachelorette party...

2
00:00:06,471 --> 00:00:11,026
...and they had a cake
that was in the shape of a man's...

3
00:00:11,272 --> 00:00:13,254
...thing-a-ding-ding.

4
00:00:13,464 --> 00:00:16,489
And I was wondering,
what would you have thought of that?

5
00:00:16,734 --> 00:00:18,572
Offensive or amusing?

6
00:00:18,787 --> 00:00:20,732
I'm not sure.
Monica, what do you think?

7
00:00:20,945 --> 00:00:23,518
- Sounds kind of tacky.
- Damn it.

8
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:27,403
I'll see if they can cancel it. If not,
maybe they can put eyes on the "hoojies"...

9
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:30,541
...and we'll just say it's just
some sort of weird elephant.

10
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:35,936
Guys, you won't believe this!

11
00:00:36,183 --> 00:00:38,923
- I just talked to my agent...
- Oh, my God!

12
00:00:41,437 --> 00:00:43,655
I'm sorry. Too soon. You go.

13
00:00:44,324 --> 00:00:46,791
I got nominated for
Days of our Lives!

14
00:00:47,455 --> 00:00:49,816
- Good for you!
- Congratulations!

15
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:52,883
I can't believe you're nominated
for an Emmy!

16
00:00:53,858 --> 00:00:57,499
- Soap Opera Digest Award?
- Nope. I'm up for a "Soapie."

17
00:00:59,598 --> 00:01:01,851
Is that something you're making up?

18
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:06,509
No, no, no, it's real!
And it has been, since 1998.

19
00:01:08,088 --> 00:01:11,148
Okay, they said they won't
cancel the cake...

20
00:01:11,358 --> 00:01:14,027
...but I was thinking we could
write "NASA" on the side...

21
00:01:14,245 --> 00:01:16,985
...and then give it to Ross.
- Okay. Yeah.

22
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:19,800
Hey, Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!

23
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:21,271
Oh, my God!

24
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:26,109
Oh, my God! That's the third most
prestigious soap opera award there is!

25
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:30,275
Thank you! I guess we know
who I'll take to the awards!

26
00:01:30,562 --> 00:01:33,552
Don't kid about that!
Will all the stars be there?

27
00:01:33,798 --> 00:01:35,945
Many are scheduled to appear.

28
00:01:38,112 --> 00:01:41,790
- I can't go. I'll be too nervous!
- I'll go.

29
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,925
You're getting married.
This is all I have.

30
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:49,695
- We should celebrate.
- Yes! And we will get you a cake...

31
00:01:49,872 --> 00:01:52,648
...in the shape of a microphone.

32
00:01:54,604 --> 00:01:56,715
With two tennis balls.

33
00:01:59,057 --> 00:02:02,212
The One With Joey's Award

34
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:41,979
Ernest Muhlbrat hypothesized that
the velociraptor, when threatened...

35
00:02:42,268 --> 00:02:46,396
...would expand its collar and
emit a high-pitched noise...

36
00:02:46,652 --> 00:02:48,455
...to frighten off predators.

37
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,947
Mr. Lewis?

38
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:52,461
What kind of noise?

39
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:57,287
Just a high-pitched,
intimidating noise.

40
00:02:57,924 --> 00:02:59,169
But like how?

41
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:02,967
Well, we don't know for sure.

42
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:07,692
But in my head,
it sounded something like this:

43
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:24,220
Of course, this is just conjecture.

44
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,132
Okay. That's all for today.

45
00:03:30,768 --> 00:03:33,650
Mr. Morse,
can I see you for a moment?

46
00:03:36,578 --> 00:03:37,549
Yes, sir?

47
00:03:38,144 --> 00:03:41,785
I need to talk to you
about your midterm exam.

48
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:46,341
- I'm afraid I had to fail you.
- Why?

49
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:49,547
Well, you need 60% to pass.

50
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:51,745
- What did I get?
- Seven.

51
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,048
That's not so good.

52
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,258
No, no, it's not.
What happened, Ned?

53
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:04,469
Maybe you can cut me some slack.
I'm sort of in love.

54
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:08,645
I'm sorry, but that's
really not my problem.

55
00:04:09,212 --> 00:04:11,501
I'm in love with you.

56
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,673
That brings me in the loop a little.

57
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,825
That's why I did so bad on this test.
I'm having a hard time concentrating.

58
00:04:21,182 --> 00:04:24,515
When you're up there
and you're teaching...

59
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,018
...and your face gets all serious...

60
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:32,202
You look so good. When you wear that
tight little turtleneck sweater...

61
00:04:36,628 --> 00:04:39,475
I'm your teacher. I'm sorry.

62
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,254
You're a student.

63
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,373
And I like women.

64
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,794
In spite of what may be written
on the backs of these chairs.

65
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,757
That guy at the counter's
totally checking you out.

66
00:04:55,973 --> 00:04:57,704
Really?

67
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,713
- Oh, my God, he's really cute!
- Go for it.

68
00:05:02,862 --> 00:05:04,356
Phoebe, I'm engaged.

69
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:07,198
I'm saying, get his number,
just in case.

70
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:12,941
But if Chandler's in an accident
and can't perform sexually...

71
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:18,129
...he'd want you to take a lover to
satisfy needs he'd no longer fulfill.

72
00:05:23,354 --> 00:05:25,430
Can I just tell you something?

73
00:05:25,754 --> 00:05:28,530
I'm very flattered, but I'm engaged.

74
00:05:31,147 --> 00:05:32,701
This is kind of embarrassing.

75
00:05:32,886 --> 00:05:35,484
I actually came over
to talk to your friend.

76
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:40,117
You should be embarrassed.

77
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:48,369
- I thought you knew I looked at you.
- I did, but that was really fun.

78
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:53,724
"The winner is... Joey Tribbiani!"

79
00:05:59,363 --> 00:06:02,589
"I honestly never expected this.

80
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,953
I didn't prepare a speech.

81
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:09,479
I'd like to thank my parents,
who've always been there for me.

82
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,806
Also like to thank my friends,
Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel..."

83
00:06:15,055 --> 00:06:16,644
- I'm fourth?
- Jeez!

84
00:06:18,986 --> 00:06:21,583
Look at you with your
maple syrup award!

85
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,065
Maybe you don't tell anyone
about this?

86
00:06:25,388 --> 00:06:28,270
No big deal.
I do that with my shampoo bottle.

87
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,490
- Really?
- Yeah.

88
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:32,618
- What award are you practicing for?
- Grammy.

89
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:35,884
For Best New Artist.

90
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:41,977
The Soapies people called today.
I also get to present an award.

91
00:06:42,227 --> 00:06:45,251
So you'll get on stage
even if you don't win.

92
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:52,169
- You don't think I'll win?
- Of course I do.

93
00:06:53,221 --> 00:06:57,005
But Favorite Returning Character?
That's a tough category.

94
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,802
You're up against the guy who
survived his own cremation.

95
00:07:01,884 --> 00:07:05,145
No, I know I might not win.
But it's just...

96
00:07:05,606 --> 00:07:08,488
I've never been nominated.
I want it so much.

97
00:07:08,807 --> 00:07:10,231
You'll probably get it.

98
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:14,093
But you should start practicing
your "gracious-loser" face.

99
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:18,157
When the cameras are on you,
you want to look disappointed.

100
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:22,087
But also that your colleague
deserved to win. Like:

101
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:27,663
You know?

102
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:33,020
- You practice losing the Grammys too?
- No, at the Grammys, I always win.

103
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:40,671
Hey, Mon. This woman only had
two bites of her steak.

104
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:43,518
- Want me to wrap it up for your dog?
- Oh, yeah.

105
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:45,470
- What's your dog's name again?
- Joey.

106
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,007
- Hey!
- How'd your date go with Jake?

107
00:07:51,323 --> 00:07:54,277
Great. We couldn't keep
our eyes off each other.

108
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:59,636
Every once in a while, he'd lean over,
stroke my hair, then touch my neck.

109
00:08:00,055 --> 00:08:02,937
Stop it. You're getting me
all tingly.

110
00:08:03,535 --> 00:08:06,381
All I could think of was,
is he gonna kiss me?

111
00:08:06,805 --> 00:08:09,438
- Did he?
- I'm a lady. I don't kiss and tell.

112
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:11,945
But this hickey speaks for itself.

113
00:08:12,198 --> 00:08:14,071
Okay, I got it. I got it.

114
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:18,701
I like him so much, I feel like
I've had 10 drinks today.

115
00:08:18,983 --> 00:08:20,157
I've only had six.

116
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:26,174
I haven't had that feeling since
I first went out with Chandler.

117
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:31,500
- I'll never have that feeling again.
- You sound like a guy.

118
00:08:31,855 --> 00:08:35,853
No, a guy would say, "I'll never
get to sleep with anyone else."

119
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:38,565
I'll never sleep with anyone else!

120
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:44,476
- Are you just realizing this now?
- No. Maybe. Yes!

121
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:49,553
I'm so busy planning the wedding,
I forgot about what I'll give up.

122
00:08:50,747 --> 00:08:53,416
I'll never have a first kiss again.

123
00:08:53,635 --> 00:08:55,746
You'll have a last kiss.

124
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,520
Can I ask you something? Has
a guy ever had a crush on you?

125
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:06,715
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?

126
00:09:08,804 --> 00:09:12,209
A kid in my class said
he's in love with me.

127
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:13,429
Whoa!

128
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:16,176
- Whoa, what?
- Ross has a boyfriend!

129
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,299
I do not have a boyfriend.

130
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:23,374
There's a guy in one of my classes
who has a crush on me.

131
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:25,189
- Really?
- Yeah.

132
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:28,104
Last year, Elizabeth, now this kid...

133
00:09:28,357 --> 00:09:31,963
What is it?
Am I giving out some kind of...

134
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:34,793
...sexy-professor vibe?

135
00:09:37,821 --> 00:09:39,481
Not right now.

136
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:45,054
The point is, my natural charisma has
made him fail his midterm.

137
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:47,280
Now I feel bad for the kid.

138
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:50,823
I had a crush on a teacher once,
and it was so hard.

139
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:55,239
I couldn't concentrate.
I blushed every time he looked at me.

140
00:09:55,565 --> 00:09:58,720
You remember what it's like
to be 19 and in love.

141
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:03,939
- I can cut him some slack.
- Yeah.

142
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:09,337
- How'd you get over that teacher?
- I didn't. I got under him.

143
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:12,185
Problem solved.

144
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:18,243
- Bye, Phoebe.
- Okay, bye.

145
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,558
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.

146
00:10:28,721 --> 00:10:29,966
Bye!

147
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,477
- Bye!
- I'll miss you!

148
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:35,284
I'll miss you too!

149
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:45,280
We said goodbye at the door
so as not to flaunt our new love.

150
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:49,238
It's okay.
You don't have to tiptoe around me.

151
00:10:49,491 --> 00:10:51,817
I've thought about it.
You know what?

152
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,196
I'm okay, not having that
new-relationship feeling.

153
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:59,193
- I miss you already!
- I miss you too!

154
00:11:02,886 --> 00:11:07,085
That's great, but I wouldn't
trade what I have for that.

155
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:11,503
I'll be with Chandler the rest
of my life. That makes me happy.

156
00:11:12,558 --> 00:11:17,077
Come sit down. We're talking
about how our relationship's deep...

157
00:11:17,324 --> 00:11:19,994
...and meaningful.
It is, don't you think?

158
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:21,386
Oh, totally.

159
00:11:22,857 --> 00:11:24,802
Pull my finger.

160
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,367
Okay, everybody, we're back in 30.

161
00:11:35,312 --> 00:11:38,123
Where have you been?
They're about to give out my award.

162
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,565
Oh, well, I was in the bathroom,
and Susan Lucci came out of a stall...

163
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:45,745
...and she had toilet paper
on her shoe, so I took it.

164
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:49,536
- Favorite Returning Male...
- This is my category!

165
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,340
- Got your speech?
- Got my speech.

166
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:52,945
Got your gracious-loser face?

167
00:11:55,873 --> 00:11:58,827
Try to remember, if you win,
you have to hug me.

168
00:11:59,248 --> 00:12:00,908
Can I squeeze your ass?

169
00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:03,307
On TV?

170
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:05,396
Yeah!

171
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,627
They say you can't go home again...

172
00:12:07,842 --> 00:12:12,635
...but these four exceptional actors have
proven that this is not always the case.

173
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:17,086
In the Favorite Returning Male
character category, the nominees are:

174
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:20,117
John Wheeler from General Hospital.

175
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:24,889
Gavin Graham from
The Young and the Restless.

176
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:28,993
Duncan Harrington from Passions.

177
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:32,992
And Joey Tribbiani from
Days of our Lives.

178
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,711
And the Soapie goes to:

179
00:12:38,702 --> 00:12:40,920
Gavin Graham from
The Young and the Restless.

180
00:12:41,138 --> 00:12:42,798
What the...?!

181
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:58,488
Presenting the Favorite Supporting
Actress award:

182
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,104
Joey Tribbiani from
Days of our Lives.

183
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:12,310
Any one of the brilliant actresses
nominated for this award...

184
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:17,145
...deserves to take it home.
Unfortunately, only one can.

185
00:13:19,443 --> 00:13:21,910
The nominees for
Favorite Supporting Actress are:

186
00:13:22,157 --> 00:13:24,411
From Passions, Erin Goff.

187
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,703
From One Life to Live, Mary Lauren
Bishop. All My Children, Sarah Renee.

188
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:36,726
And from Days of our Lives,
Jessica Ashley.

189
00:13:36,944 --> 00:13:38,533
And the winner is:

190
00:13:39,831 --> 00:13:42,749
Jessica Ashley from Days of our Lives.

191
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,685
Unfortunately, Jessica
couldn't be with us tonight...

192
00:13:47,938 --> 00:13:50,441
...so I'll accept this award
on her behalf.

193
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:56,971
And I'm sure that Jessica...

194
00:13:57,297 --> 00:13:59,479
...wants to thank my parents...

195
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:01,745
...who always believed in me.

196
00:14:02,203 --> 00:14:03,935
She'd also like to thank my friends:

197
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,394
Chandler, Monica, Ross,
Phoebe and Rachel...

198
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,656
...who's sitting right there.

199
00:14:22,591 --> 00:14:25,473
Why'd we rush out so fast?

200
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:29,791
I was this close to getting Luke and
Laura to sign Susan Lucci's toilet paper.

201
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:34,272
We had to get out of there
because... Look what I won!

202
00:14:36,194 --> 00:14:39,314
Oh, my God. You stole her award!

203
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:43,389
No, no, no. I'm accepting it
on her behalf.

204
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,727
I don't think you know
what "behalf" means.

205
00:14:47,048 --> 00:14:51,117
Sure I do. It's a verb.
As in "I be half-in' it"!

206
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,672
- You've got to take this back.
- I should've won. I really wanted it.

207
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:04,370
She didn't care enough to come to
the thing. It could also be a Grammy.

208
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:09,236
No, Joey.

209
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,238
No one saw me take it.
There's a whole table of them.

210
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,956
Do you want an award you didn't win?

211
00:15:16,273 --> 00:15:20,580
No, I want an award I did win.
But nobody's given me any of those!

212
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:25,379
If I put it up, when people come over,
they'll see it...

213
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,056
...and think I won it.

214
00:15:27,372 --> 00:15:30,219
Joey, it says
"Best Supporting Actress."

215
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:32,791
I can scratch that right off.

216
00:15:34,053 --> 00:15:36,484
This is wrong.
You have to take it back.

217
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:41,214
You don't want to win an award
this way. You're very talented.

218
00:15:41,602 --> 00:15:46,608
Someday you'll win one of these for
real and that one will mean something.

219
00:15:49,187 --> 00:15:52,069
- Oh, all right.
- All right? Thank you.

220
00:15:53,188 --> 00:15:55,442
- I'll take it back tomorrow.
- Thank you.

221
00:16:07,244 --> 00:16:09,782
If I can't have it,
you can't have it!

222
00:16:16,672 --> 00:16:20,635
- Professor Geller?
- Yes, Mr. Lewis? How can I help you?

223
00:16:20,952 --> 00:16:24,213
I know I didn't do well
on my midterms and stuff.

224
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:27,585
But I was hoping you could
change my grade.

225
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,307
And why, exactly, would I do that?

226
00:16:30,832 --> 00:16:32,671
Because I'm in love with you.

227
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:36,677
What?

228
00:16:37,652 --> 00:16:41,293
Yeah. I'm all in love
with you and stuff.

229
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:46,269
- So could you change my grade?
- No!

230
00:16:47,428 --> 00:16:49,504
Why not? You changed Ned's grade.

231
00:16:49,794 --> 00:16:53,756
That's different. Because he was
actually in love with me.

232
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:57,027
No, he's not!
He's totally yanking your chain.

233
00:16:57,274 --> 00:16:59,872
He's done this with
three other teachers.

234
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:03,918
- What?
- He's got a girlfriend.

235
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:08,681
I can't believe someone
would do that for a grade.

236
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,104
I know.

237
00:17:10,391 --> 00:17:11,706
It's awful.

238
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,260
I love you.

239
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:21,304
- All right.
- What? It's true.

240
00:17:21,524 --> 00:17:25,628
Oh, God... Okay. Oh, you love me?
You love me?

241
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,551
All right, fine. You love me so much,
come over here and give me a kiss.

242
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:50,255
You got an 80! You didn't even fail!
Have some self-respect!

243
00:17:54,785 --> 00:17:56,730
- Have you seen Chandler?
- No, why?

244
00:17:56,977 --> 00:18:00,002
I keep thinking about all
the things I won't have.

245
00:18:00,316 --> 00:18:03,128
It's freaking me out.
I don't know what to do.

246
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:04,481
Don't sweat it.

247
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:09,456
Chandler's not around, so get it
out of your system. That guy's cute.

248
00:18:11,241 --> 00:18:12,830
Come on, I'm serious.

249
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:18,434
- I've got to talk to him about this.
- That's the last thing you want to do.

250
00:18:18,895 --> 00:18:22,406
- Why?
- Because you're marrying him!

251
00:18:23,175 --> 00:18:25,119
You gotta help me out here.

252
00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:28,975
I've never been engaged.
I've never really been married.

253
00:18:29,263 --> 00:18:31,861
I can only tell you
what my mother told me.

254
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:36,422
When you have doubts or fears or
anxieties about a relationship...

255
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:39,283
...don't communicate them
to your husband.

256
00:18:41,058 --> 00:18:44,012
I'm not supposed to share
my doubts and fears...

257
00:18:44,328 --> 00:18:47,282
...with the guy I'm spending
the rest of my life with?

258
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:49,224
That is correct. Yes.

259
00:18:49,547 --> 00:18:53,746
You're supposed to put all that stuff
in a little box in your mind...

260
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,175
...and lock it up.

261
00:18:56,192 --> 00:18:57,959
- Your mother told you this?
- Yes.

262
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:02,729
The woman who married a bunch of times
and killed herself when you were 13?

263
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,655
Oh, my God, you're right.

264
00:19:05,934 --> 00:19:08,710
Tell Chandler.
Hurry, before it's too late!

265
00:19:08,996 --> 00:19:13,646
Wait! Does this also mean that
putting out doesn't get you love?

266
00:19:19,085 --> 00:19:21,967
- I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
- Wait, wait.

267
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,892
Rach, please be cool, okay?
I work with this woman.

268
00:19:26,114 --> 00:19:27,917
Okay, I'm totally cool.

269
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:29,972
Come in.

270
00:19:31,715 --> 00:19:34,004
- Hey, Jessica.
- Hey, Jess.

271
00:19:35,402 --> 00:19:36,647
This is my friend Rachel.

272
00:19:36,898 --> 00:19:38,452
- Hi.
- What's up?

273
00:19:42,396 --> 00:19:45,350
Here's your Soapie.
I accepted it for you.

274
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:49,558
Oh, my God. I won?
Do you have any idea what this means?

275
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:56,199
You're not gonna put it
on your shelf or anything?

276
00:19:56,487 --> 00:20:00,758
No, I try to save that for real
awards. Now if you'll excuse me?

277
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,764
- Take it back?
- Absolutely.

278
00:20:11,204 --> 00:20:12,591
Yeah, you do!

279
00:20:15,553 --> 00:20:18,542
Honey?
As we get closer to the wedding...

280
00:20:18,823 --> 00:20:21,325
...is there anything
you'd like to share?

281
00:20:21,675 --> 00:20:25,495
Okay. I think the centerpieces
are too big.

282
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:28,557
You're wrong.
The centerpieces are fine.

283
00:20:30,165 --> 00:20:34,127
- Do you ever get scared at all?
- Kind of. They're really big.

284
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:41,156
Doesn't it freak you out that you'll
never be with anybody new again?

285
00:20:42,168 --> 00:20:43,104
What?

286
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:46,094
I love you so much.

287
00:20:47,491 --> 00:20:51,418
Sometimes it bothers me that
I'll never have that feeling.

288
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:53,753
When you first meet someone...

289
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:57,506
...and it's new and exciting.
You know that rush?

290
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:03,145
No, when I first meet somebody...

291
00:21:03,391 --> 00:21:07,733
...it's mostly panic, anxiety
and a great deal of sweating.

292
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,036
Okay. But you're a guy.

293
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:15,452
Aren't you freaked out that you'll
never sleep with anybody else?

294
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,139
Sleeping with somebody, no.

295
00:21:18,386 --> 00:21:22,277
Anxiety, panic and, I'm afraid,
even more sweating.

296
00:21:23,814 --> 00:21:24,988
Even with me?

297
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,831
I was dangerously dehydrated the
first six months of our relationship.

298
00:21:31,398 --> 00:21:36,404
For me, the rush is knowing that we'll
be together the rest of our lives.

299
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:39,533
- Really?
- Well, yeah.

300
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:44,684
Knowing you're having these thoughts,
we're back to panic, anxiety and...

301
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:48,337
...I'll definitely need
some kind of sports drink.

302
00:21:50,673 --> 00:21:54,255
Come here. Oh, you don't
have to worry.

303
00:21:54,535 --> 00:21:59,221
Besides, you know what? I'll have
a lot of new things with you.

304
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:03,958
The first time we buy a house. Our
first kid. Our first grandkid.

305
00:22:04,276 --> 00:22:06,707
Water. Water. Water.

306
00:22:08,555 --> 00:22:11,545
Mr. Morse? Can I speak to you
for a moment?

307
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,883
That was a great lecture today.
Did you get a little haircut?

308
00:22:19,132 --> 00:22:22,679
Yeah, yeah. Do you like it?
Do you love it?

309
00:22:24,247 --> 00:22:27,093
I want you to know I'm
changing your grade back.

310
00:22:27,343 --> 00:22:29,703
What? Why?

311
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,662
I know what you're trying
to pull here. It won't work.

312
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:38,295
I'm not trying to pull anything.
Look, I love you, dude.

313
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:43,758
I'm not even gonna talk about this.
This little "thing" is over.

314
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:48,599
I know you have a girlfriend.
And I know about the other professors.

315
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:52,283
How do you think that makes me feel?
You used me!

316
00:22:52,532 --> 00:22:54,893
You don't love me and you never did!

317
00:22:58,272 --> 00:23:00,810
Professor Winston.
Professor Frederickson.

318
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,984
I'll be right with you.

319
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:08,599
Don't make this worse and I'll
give you a "C." Shall we?

320
00:23:15,843 --> 00:23:17,503
I'll be out in a second.

321
00:23:23,358 --> 00:23:25,825
"It's just so unexpected!

322
00:23:28,054 --> 00:23:32,218
I'll tell you, it's such
an honor to just be nominated...

323
00:23:32,473 --> 00:23:34,834
...for a Nobel Prize.

324
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:40,812
And, you know, to win one
for a massage!

325
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:45,165
Especially just after winning a
Tony Award for Best Actress..."

326
00:23:45,451 --> 00:23:47,254
Our reservations are at 8.

327
00:23:47,503 --> 00:23:51,086
"...in Reservations at Eight
by Neil Simon.

328
00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:55,008
Thank you, Neil.
Thank you for the words."

329
00:23:55,714 --> 00:23:58,384
Finish this later.
