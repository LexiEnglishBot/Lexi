1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:06,005
You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma
have her first cookie.

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,799
Her first cookie?
She has cookies all the time.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,802
I've never given her a cookie.

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,639
- Have you?
- No.

5
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,810
No. And for the record, I've also
never given her frosting from a can.

6
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:24,440
Hey, Rach, the adoption agency
needs letters of recommendation...

7
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,942
...and we wondered
if you would write one for us?

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,986
Of course. I would be honored.

9
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,195
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

10
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,702
I think there's been an oversight.

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,122
Joe, we would have asked you.
We thought you wouldn't be interested.

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,960
Yeah, it's just that we don't think of you
as really being so much with the words.

13
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,591
Clearly, we were wrong.

14
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,595
I got a lot of nice stuff
to say about you guys, okay?

15
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,139
And I know how much you want
to have a baby...

16
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,641
...and I would love to help you get one.

17
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,645
You know what?
Then we want you to do it.

18
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:07,357
Thank you. All right.
Let me see how I'm gonna start.

19
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,944
"Dear Baby Adoption Decider People..."

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,991
So excited about your letter.

21
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,037
- Hey.
- Hey, Phoebe.

22
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:24,166
- Wow, don't you look nice.
- Yes, I do.

23
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,669
Today's Mike and my
one-year anniversary.

24
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,421
What's it the anniversary of?

25
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:33,425
Your first, uh, date, your first kiss,
first time you had sex?

26
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:34,843
Yeah.

27
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,765
So you must be going somewhere
fancy to celebrate.

28
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,350
Uh-huh. Um, a Knicks game.

29
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,269
Uh, ha, ha...
Aren't you a little overdressed?

30
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,647
Hey, I've never had a one-year
anniversary before...

31
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,691
...so no matter where we go,
I'm wearing something fancy...

32
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,777
...and I'm gonna put on
my finest jewelry...

33
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,822
...and we're gonna have sex
in a public restroom.

34
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,698
You guys do that?

35
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,910
Chandler won't even have sex
in our bathroom.

36
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,871
That's where people make number two.

37
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,178
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

38
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:05,976
So, you know, I have a little time
if you want to...

39
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,020
Oh. Oh...

40
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,148
I'd love to, but I really have
to grade these papers.

41
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,067
Oh... Fine. It's fine.

42
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,195
I'll just shower by myself.

43
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,991
B. B. B. B. B.

44
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,620
Ross, you gave a B
to a Pottery Barn catalog.

45
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,497
Well, it had some good ideas.
Take off your shirt.

46
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,794
- Damn it.
- Rachel, open! It's your sister!

47
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,297
I have to talk to you.

48
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,050
Hi, Amy.

49
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:45,182
- You're not Rachel.
- Still sharp as a tack.

50
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:50,062
Um, Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy.
Amy, this is Charlie.

51
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,356
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi, hi.

52
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,815
And you are?

53
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,866
Ross? I grew up on your block?

54
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,286
We had Thanksgiving together
last year?

55
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,372
I had a baby with your sister?

56
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,291
No. I...

57
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,087
Did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?

58
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,759
Yes. Yes, you did.

59
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,641
Hi, Rachel. Here's your sister Amy.

60
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,352
She thinks I need pec implants.

61
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,688
Amy? Hi.

62
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,983
- You remember Joey.
- Yeah. Hey, sure.

63
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,735
- The Days of our Lives guy.
- That's right, yeah.

64
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,321
You are not good.

65
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,993
Always nice to meet a fan.

66
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,538
- So, now, what are you doing here?
- I have huge news.

67
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:55,335
- Hold on. Let me check on the baby.
- This is important. Can't Ella wait?

68
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,546
Uh, her name is Emma.

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,717
Why did you change it?
Ella was so much prettier.

70
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:07,014
What do I know? I just sell
Middle Eastern food from a cart.

71
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,433
Hey, your English is getting better.

72
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,273
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

73
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,650
She may be the hottest girl
I've ever hated.

74
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:22,696
- What you working on?
- Monica and Chandler's recommendation.

75
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:26,241
I want it to sound smart, but I don't
know any big words or anything.

76
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:30,287
- Why don't you use your thesaurus?
- What did I just say?

77
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,165
Watch.

78
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:38,545
Here, you highlight the word
you want to change, uh, go under "tools"...

79
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,089
...and the thesaurus generates... Gives.

80
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,594
Gives a whole list of choices.

81
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,221
You can pick the word
that sounds smartest.

82
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,807
My God, that's great. I'm smart.

83
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,351
No, no, I'm:

84
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:56,021
"Brainy, bright, clever." I love this thing!

85
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,691
Look out, ladies!
Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!

86
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,612
God...

87
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,323
...so beautiful.

88
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,075
I know, isn't she?

89
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,036
No, I was talking about your bedding.

90
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:17,000
- All right, what's your news, Amy?
- Oh. Ahem.

91
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,543
Well...

92
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,504
...I'm getting married.

93
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,839
Wow! Oh, my God!

94
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,675
- To who?
- This guy.

95
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,222
He has a killer apartment.

96
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,811
- And?
- And it's on 5th.

97
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,980
And the elevator opens up
right into the living room.

98
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,275
- No, what's he like?
- Oh, he's okay.

99
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,321
Do you remember
my old boyfriend Mark?

100
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,783
- Yeah.
- It's his dad.

101
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,704
- Huh. Wow, so he's gotta be...
- Old? Yeah.

102
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,501
But he travels a lot,
so he's hardly ever there.

103
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,381
Sweetie, I gotta tell you,
it sounds a little bit like...

104
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,092
...you like the apartment
more than you like...

105
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,552
Myron.

106
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,554
Yeah, I told you he was old.

107
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,348
Sit down. Sit down.

108
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,100
Oh, honey, you know...

109
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,270
...I once also almost married
somebody that I didn't love.

110
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,814
- Do you remember Barry?
- Remember him?

111
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,526
God, we used to make out all the time
after you went to sleep.

112
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,197
Sometimes just nodding is okay.

113
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,992
Um... But anyway, listen.

114
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,954
Not marrying Barry was the best
decision that I ever, ever made.

115
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:40,292
Honey, Amy, you deserve true love.
Your soul mate is out there somewhere.

116
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,380
Someone that is your age,
that is smart, that is fun...

117
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,383
...and that you care about.

118
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,303
You're right.

119
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,722
- You're right. I'm gonna do it.
- Okay.

120
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,766
I'm gonna marry Myron
and keep looking for Mr. Right.

121
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,518
Okay.

122
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,189
Okay, let's keep talking.

123
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,909
Excuse me. Anniversary.

124
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,245
Excuse me. Anniversary.

125
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,748
Um, yeah.

126
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:24,336
Sir, could you move your nachos?
They're in my seat.

127
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,507
It's my anniversary.

128
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,429
Here we are.

129
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,933
- I can't believe it's been a whole year.
- I know.

130
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,768
This has been the best year...

131
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,648
- This has been the best year of my life!
- Me too!

132
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,400
I never thought I could
love someone this much!

133
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,611
I feel the same way!

134
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:54,282
You're so generous and kind,
and you're amazing in bed!

135
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,663
It's our anniversary.

136
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,710
Please turn your attention
to the big screen on the scoreboard.

137
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,754
Someone has a special question to ask.

138
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,091
Aw...

139
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:17,889
Oh, how lame.
It's so tacky and impersonal.

140
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:21,601
- Really?
- It's the worst way to propose.

141
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,230
Excuse me.

142
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,237
Hey. I finished my recommendation.
Here.

143
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,782
And I think you'll be very, very happy.

144
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,369
It's the longest I ever spent
on a computer without looking at porn.

145
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,957
I don't understand.

146
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,086
Some of the words a little
too sophisticated for you?

147
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,797
It doesn't make any sense.

148
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:55,260
Well, of course it does. It's smart.
I used a thesaurus.

149
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,887
On every word?

150
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,349
Yep.

151
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,520
All right, what was
this sentence originally?

152
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,898
"They are warm, nice people
with big hearts."

153
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:14,029
And that became, "They are humid,
prepossessing Homo sapiens...

154
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,490
...with full-sized aortic pumps."

155
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,537
Yeah. Yeah. And hey,
I really mean it, dude.

156
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,875
All right, Joey,
I don't think we can use this.

157
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,210
- Why not?
- Well, because you signed it:

158
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,339
"Baby Kangaroo Tribbiani."

159
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:40,430
Why don't you stop worrying about
sounding smart and just be yourself?

160
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,350
You don't need a thesaurus.
Just write from here.

161
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,477
Your full-sized aortic pump.

162
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,984
- Amy. Hi.
- I took your advice.

163
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,404
- I left Myron.
- Good for you!

164
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,658
I know. I'm Erin Brockovich.

165
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,995
Yes, you are.

166
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,082
- Aw, I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

167
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,042
- Oh.
- So can I stay with you?

168
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,965
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.

169
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,680
Ah, look who's back.

170
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,265
Why do you have bags?
Rach, why does she have bags?

171
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,351
I'm staying with you guys.

172
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,645
- What?
- We're gonna be roomies!

173
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,854
Come on.

174
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,865
- You slept out here?
- Yeah.

175
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:45,412
Amy kept kicking me in her sleep,
yelling, "Myron, get off!"

176
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,125
But, uh, we're getting rid of her, right?
Please tell me we're getting rid of her?

177
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,585
- Joey, I can't do that.
- Oh, come on.

178
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,547
Last night I was finishing off a pizza,
and she said:

179
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,091
"A moment on the lips,
forever on the hips."

180
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,470
I don't need that kind of talk
in my house!

181
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,639
Joey, look, I know that she's difficult...

182
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,434
...but I think it's really good
that she's here.

183
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,938
Because we'll appreciate it
more when she's gone?

184
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:17,610
No, it's just... Look, when I first moved
to this city, I was a lot like her.

185
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:22,240
I was spoiled, self-centered.
And you guys really took care of me.

186
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,367
Yeah. Monica made us.

187
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,829
Well, whatever. I really appreciate it...

188
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,082
...because I don't think I would be
the person that I am today...

189
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,084
...if it wasn't for you guys.

190
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,837
So I want to help Amy
the way you guys helped me.

191
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,299
And I know it's gonna take patience,
but that's okay.

192
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,969
- Good morning.
- Yeah.

193
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,306
Amy, that's what I
was supposed to wear today.

194
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,141
That's why I hung it on the door.

195
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,435
Oh, sweetie, you can't pull this off.

196
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,735
Amy, you know what? I was thinking that
maybe now would be a good time...

197
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,697
...for us to sit down and, you know,
talk about your future.

198
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,742
Oh, I can't, honey. I'm gonna go
get my eyebrows shaped.

199
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,368
I am not happy.

200
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,749
Uh... Sure you want to eat that?

201
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,754
I'm curvy and I like it!

202
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,510
- Hi.
- Hi.

203
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,346
I just had the worst anniversary ever.

204
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,681
I doubt that.
Tell her about us last year.

205
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:34,187
Oh, well, I bought Chandler a $500 watch,
and he wrote me a rap song.

206
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,900
- Seriously?
- Word.

207
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,487
Well, mine was worse than that.

208
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,864
- Well, what happened?
- We were at the game...

209
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,784
...and this guy proposed to his girlfriend
on the big screen thing.

210
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,662
- Oh, that is so tacky.
- Well, that's what I said.

211
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,500
But it turns out Mike was planning to
propose to me that same way last night.

212
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,710
Oh, my God. Mike was gonna propose?

213
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,046
- Phoebe, that's huge.
- Do you want to marry him?

214
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,298
Yeah, I really do. Yes.

215
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,884
But after I dumped on the way
he was gonna propose...

216
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,886
...I don't think he's ever gonna ask again.

217
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,556
I mean, I said no in Barbados,
and now this?

218
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,559
She's right. If I were a guy and...

219
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,441
Did I just say, "If I were a guy"?

220
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,986
Maybe you don't need him
to propose to you.

221
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,571
Maybe you could propose to him.

222
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,491
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
Isn't that a little desperate?

223
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,869
I proposed to Chandler.

224
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,583
All right, moving on.

225
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,294
I don't think it was desperate.
I think it was amazing.

226
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,503
Thank you.

227
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:44,799
- Well, do you think I should propose?
- I think it could be kind of great.

228
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:49,220
Absolutely. You'll love the feeling.
There's nothing like it.

229
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,309
Okay. Okay. So how should I do it?

230
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,769
How about at a game on the big screen?

231
00:14:56,937 --> 00:15:00,481
Huh! How about at a Foot Locker?

232
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:05,653
What? What, he obviously thinks
that's a nice way to be proposed to.

233
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:09,407
- Plus, he'd never suspect it.
- Yeah, that does make sense.

234
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,244
- Okay, now, would you two like that?
- Sounds good to me.

235
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,622
But what would a guy think?

236
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,668
- Uh, Nana's on the phone.
- Wow.

237
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,505
That's interesting,
since she died seven years ago.

238
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,758
She did?

239
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,135
Who got her condo in Boca?

240
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,763
Hello?

241
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,682
It's our nanny.

242
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,267
Hi.

243
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:41,147
Oh, God, I hope you feel better.
Okay. Bye.

244
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,066
That's Molly. She's sick.

245
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,361
- Can you watch Emma today?
- I can't. I have back-to-back classes.

246
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,530
Did Molly say what she had?
Because my throat's been hurting.

247
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,532
Menstrual cramps.

248
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,828
I don't think that's what this is.

249
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,791
- Can any of you watch Emma?
- No, I'm sorry, sweetie.

250
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,835
No, I've got work,
and then I'm proposing.

251
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,546
Great. Shoot. What am I gonna do?

252
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,590
Well, I could do it.

253
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:11,219
- Well, actually...
- Can I talk to you for a second?

254
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,553
Yeah.

255
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,807
Um, I do not want her
babysitting our child.

256
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,560
- Why not?
- For one thing, she keeps calling her Ella.

257
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,064
- Ella's a nice name.
- Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.

258
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,358
- What, the next one?
- Okay.

259
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,320
I don't want her watching our baby.

260
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,699
Ross, I am trying to help her
become a better person.

261
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,784
This is a huge breakthrough for her.

262
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:39,205
She just offered to do something
for another human being.

263
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,958
- You know, I don't know.
- Ross, I'm telling you...

264
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,962
...she's giving up getting her eyebrows
shaped to do this, all right?

265
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,841
Do you understand how important
that is in our world?

266
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:56,180
Uh, listen, I couldn't help but overhear,
because I was trying to.

267
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,685
Listen, let me do this.
I really want to help you guys out.

268
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,063
And plus, Rachel's been
so wonderful to me.

269
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,318
- Absolutely.
- Oh, great!

270
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,738
So how much does it pay?

271
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,329
Hey, Joe. How's the second draft
of the letter coming?

272
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,833
Great. I'm finished. In fact,
I just dropped it off at the agency.

273
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,920
- You dropped it off?
- Yeah.

274
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,089
Can we read it?
Can you print out another copy?

275
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,050
No can do, amigo.

276
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:37,513
No, I didn't use the computer.
It felt more personal to handwrite it.

277
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,433
- You handwrote it?
- Yeah, and don't worry.

278
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,102
I didn't try to sound smart at all.

279
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,521
See you later.

280
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:49,400
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That letter is gonna go in our file.

281
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,402
We're never gonna get a kid.

282
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,780
We're gonna be
one of those old couples...

283
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:57,283
...that collects orchids
or has a lot of birds.

284
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,202
It's okay. It's okay. You know what?

285
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,789
I will just call the agency
and tell them to throw out the letter.

286
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,499
Okay, good.

287
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,834
Hello, this is Chandler Bing.

288
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:11,297
Someone just dropped off a handwritten
recommendation letter and...

289
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,343
Uh-huh.

290
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,595
Okay.

291
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,516
Thank you. Goodbye.

292
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,559
We're screwed, aren't we?

293
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,437
You know what? Just tell me
on the way to the bird store.

294
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,440
- They loved it.
- What?

295
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,694
They thought it was very smart of us to have
a child write the recommendation letter.

296
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,823
They thought Joey was a child?

297
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:40,034
She guessed 8, 9,
based on his drawings.

298
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,706
- Hi.
- What'd you guys do today?

299
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:51,003
Ella wanted to go out, so we went
shopping and got some sushi.

300
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,590
- That sounds like fun.
- Yeah, not really.

301
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,300
Babies are dull.

302
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:01,931
- Hey. Hi, how's my girl?
- I'm fine.

303
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:06,602
And I got you a present
for letting me stay with you.

304
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,856
- Ready?
- Yeah.

305
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,024
Ta-da!

306
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,820
You pierced her ears?

307
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,865
Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?

308
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,789
You pierced her ears?

309
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,375
How could you do this
without telling me?

310
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:33,254
If I had told you, then it wouldn't
have been a surprise, now would it?

311
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,173
I think she looks cute.

312
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,134
But I am wrong.

313
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:43,347
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.

314
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,100
Why, did something happen
to his falafel cart?

315
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,187
- Hey, guys.
- Ross!

316
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:53,274
Hi, Emma.
Oh. Why is she wearing her hat so low?

317
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,402
- She can barely see.
- I don't really want her to see.

318
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,363
Why not?

319
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,200
Because there are so many
terrible sights in this world.

320
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,745
Like war. Or that thing
in Joey's refrigerator. Remember?

321
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,998
It was in a milk carton,
but it looked like meat?

322
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,792
Come here. Come here.

323
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,338
There she is. Hi.

324
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,051
- What?
- Nothing.

325
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,803
Hi.

326
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,890
What...?

327
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:40,905
- Please tell me those are clip-ons!
- Oh, they're real.

328
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,616
Did she do this to her?

329
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,244
I told you we shouldn't have
left Emma with her!

330
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,371
I know. And you were right, Ross.

331
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,166
Okay? You are so irresponsible!
I am never letting you babysit again!

332
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,293
You know what?
This kid needs me, okay?

333
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:58,339
- She needs to have a cool, fun aunt.
- I'm a cool, fun aunt.

334
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,299
Okay.

335
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:06,264
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun
at organized indoor projects.

336
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:11,602
All I wanted to do was help you try
to figure out what to do with your life.

337
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,062
This is how you repay me?

338
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,983
I don't need you to help me. I already
know what I'm gonna do with my life.

339
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,653
- Oh, yeah? Since when?
- Since today.

340
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,033
I am going to be a baby stylist.

341
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,371
- What?
- That's not a thing!

342
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,999
Well, it should be.

343
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,960
I'm gonna help babies learn
how to accessorize...

344
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,505
...what colors to wear,
what clothes are slimming.

345
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,843
- Babies don't care if they're slim!
- Enter Amy.

346
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:48,139
- Amy, I... I just... I just wanna...
- What? What are you gonna do?

347
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,768
No more falafel for you!

348
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,366
- Great game, huh?
- Uh-huh.

349
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:13,998
- Why do you keep looking at the screen?
- I'm not. I'm praying.

350
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,375
Please let the Knicks win.

351
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,711
Thank you, Thor.

352
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,423
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

353
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,759
- Well, I think you should wait.
- Why?

354
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:30,389
Well, if you don't hold it in,
you don't get all the nutrients.

355
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,727
Please turn your attention
to the big screen on the scoreboard.

356
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,939
Someone has a special question to ask.

357
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,320
Mike Hannigan, will you marry me?

358
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,575
Get a load of this.
She's proposing to him!

359
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:53,371
Guess we know who wears the pants
in that family.

360
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,165
Well, that's not very enlightened.

361
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,960
Hey! Hey!

362
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,339
Boo us? Boo you!

363
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:13,099
Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani.

364
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,184
Oh, hi.

365
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,355
Well, I'm glad you liked my letter.

366
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:24,402
No, my mommy and daddy
aren't home right now.

367
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,947
Okay, bye-bye.

368
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,910
She was nice.

369
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,497
Joey, get Amy's bags.
She is moving out.

370
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,998
Woo-hoo!

371
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:42,795
- You're kicking me out?
- You put holes in my baby's ears.

372
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,172
At least now people
will know she's a girl!

373
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,302
I can't believe I ever
even tried to help you.

374
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,055
- You are so beyond help!
- You know what?

375
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,225
Ever since I got here,
you have been nothing but negative.

376
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,060
- Excuse me?
- You didn't want me...

377
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,604
...to marry the old guy
with the great apartment.

378
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:05,568
Then I tried to help your daughter
de-emphasize her flaws...

379
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,820
...and suddenly I'm the bad guy?

380
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:11,907
- Joey, where are those bags?
- She has a lot of crap!

381
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,995
You know? When I moved in here,
I thought, "This will be so great.

382
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,248
Just us sisters back together again
like when we were kids."

383
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,418
Except without that stupid Jill. Oh.

384
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,879
Who has gotten fat, by the way.

385
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,090
Seriously?

386
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,843
Mom said she gained, like, 15 pounds.

387
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:33,846
- Hips or thighs?
- Ass and face.

388
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:38,058
Oh, my God!
I thought she was on Atkins.

389
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,227
She was. Carbs found her.

390
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,276
See? This is what I wanted.

391
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:51,030
Two sisters talking about real stuff.

392
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,618
Oh, I can give you that.

393
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,162
- You can?
- Yeah.

394
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:01,248
I kept trying to make you
a better person, but you're...

395
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,752
You're already a pretty perfect version
of what you are.

396
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,755
Thank you.

397
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,591
You gotta admit, Emma does look cute.

398
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,721
- Did you just say, "Emma"?
- Oh, I'm sorry. Ella.

399
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,147
That woman didn't know what
she was talking about, Mike.

400
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,650
Obviously, you have balls.

401
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,862
- Please, let's just forget the whole thing.
- I would love it.

402
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,948
- Consider it forgotten.
- Thank you.

403
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,450
But just so you know...

404
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:42,248
However and whenever you decide
to propose, I promise I'll say yes.

405
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,917
Whether, you know,
it's at a basketball game...

406
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,002
...or in skywriting...

407
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,880
...or, you know, like some lame
guy in a cheesy movie...

408
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,091
...who hides it in the cake.

409
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:00,307
It's in the cake, isn't it?

410
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,895
Where else would lame
Mr. No-Balls hide it?

411
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,898
What's the matter with me?
Why do I keep ruining this?

412
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,484
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's my fault.

413
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,195
I keep trying to propose
in these stupid ways...

414
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:17,575
...and I just wanna tell you I love you,
and I wanna spend my life with you...

415
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,207
- I'm gonna do this now.
- Oh, my God.

416
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,838
- Phoebe, I...
- Wait. Oh, wait.

417
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,052
Oh, no.

418
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,225
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

419
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,810
Okay.

420
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,107
Phoebe, I love you.

421
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:55,154
There's no one else in the world I would
ask to marry me three times.

422
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:00,075
But I want to take care of you...

423
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,660
...have babies with you...

424
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,247
...and grow old with you.

425
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,377
Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

426
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,172
Yes.

427
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,181
- I love you.
- I love you more.

428
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,557
Not possible.

429
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,569
She's gonna be Mrs. No-Balls!

430
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,703
So how's the, uh, baby-styling
business going?

431
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,997
Not that great.

432
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:51,043
It's almost as if people don't want
to hear that their babies are ugly.

433
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,713
That's shocking.

434
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,759
There's Ross. Hey, Ross.

435
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,805
Hello, Ross?

436
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,100
He's rude.
