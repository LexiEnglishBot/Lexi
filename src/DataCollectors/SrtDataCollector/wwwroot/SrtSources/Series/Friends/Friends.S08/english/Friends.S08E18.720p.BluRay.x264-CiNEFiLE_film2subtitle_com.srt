00:00:03,158 --> 00:00:07,036
Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone
to your parents' anniversary party?

2
00:00:07,287 --> 00:00:08,329
- Sure.
- Yeah.

3
00:00:08,496 --> 00:00:11,791
- Who's the guy?
- Parker, I met him at the dry cleaners.

4
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:15,170
Did he put a little starch
in your bloomers?

5
00:00:17,797 --> 00:00:19,799
Who said that?

6
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:25,054
No, he's really great, though.
He has this incredible zest for life.

7
00:00:25,346 --> 00:00:27,015
And he treats me like a queen.

8
00:00:27,182 --> 00:00:30,143
Except at night, when he treats me
like the naughty girl I am.

9
00:00:32,312 --> 00:00:35,190
Oh, by the way, would it be okay
if I give the toast this year?

10
00:00:35,523 --> 00:00:38,318
Are you sure you want to
after what happened at their 20th?

11
00:00:38,526 --> 00:00:43,031
- Yeah, I'd really like to.
- Hopefully this time Mom won't boo you.

12
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:48,661
Yes. Every year Ross makes the toast,
and it always makes them cry.

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,542
- This year, I'm gonna make them cry.
- You wonder why Ross is their favorite?

14
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:59,881
No, really, any time Ross makes a toast,
everyone cries and pats him on the back.

15
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:04,802
And they all come up to me and say,
"God, your brother."

16
00:01:05,053 --> 00:01:09,390
You know what they're gonna say
this year? "God, you."

17
00:01:10,892 --> 00:01:13,895
Well, I can promise you,
at least one person will be crying.

18
00:01:14,062 --> 00:01:18,316
I'm an actor, and any actor
worth his salt can cry on cue.

19
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:22,570
- Really? You can do that?
- Oh, you kidding me? Watch.

20
00:01:32,455 --> 00:01:35,917
Well, I can't do it
with you guys watching me.

21
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:19,794
- What are you doing?
- I'm working on my toast for the party.

22
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:23,464
Or as I like to call it:
"Sob-fest 2002."

23
00:02:24,674 --> 00:02:26,884
- Hey, check this out.
- It's a dog.

24
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:29,637
It's a dead dog.

25
00:02:29,887 --> 00:02:32,807
That's Chi-Chi.
She died when I was in high school.

26
00:02:33,016 --> 00:02:36,936
- You're gonna talk about their dead pet?
- It's good stuff, huh?

27
00:02:39,147 --> 00:02:40,648
- Hi.
ROSS <i>&</i> JOEY: Hey.

28
00:02:40,898 --> 00:02:43,985
Joey? You got a present for my parents?
That's so sweet.

29
00:02:44,152 --> 00:02:48,072
Yeah. In honor of their 35th anniversary,
I had a star named after them.

30
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,324
ALL:
Aw.

31
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:55,413

- And I got them Kama Sutra for the Elderly.</i>

32
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:58,958
- Do you guys have any extra ribbon?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

33
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:05,673
What do you need? We got, uh, lace,
satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt--

34
00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:09,552
And I think my testicles
may be in here too.

35
00:03:11,846 --> 00:03:17,852
AW. Chi-Chi. Oh, I loved this dog.

36
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:22,649
You know, uh, Monica couldn't get braces
because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.

37
00:03:23,816 --> 00:03:28,863
- What?
- You were the 200-pounder who rode her.

38
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:36,037
Hey. Everybody, this is Parker.
Parker, this is--

39
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:41,250
No, wait, don't tell me. Let me guess:
Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel...

00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:43,503
...and I'm sorry,
Phoebe didn't mention you.

41

Chandler, I'm kidding.
Already you're my favorite.

42
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:54,389
- Tell me a little about yourselves.
- Uh, actually, we should get going.

Rachel, Rachel, look how you glow.
May I?

46
00:04:04,524 --> 00:04:06,484
I think you already are.

47
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:10,113
Rachel, you have life
growing inside you.

48
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:16,035
Is there anything more miraculous--
Ooh, a picture of a dog. Whose is this?

49
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:20,748
That's my old dog.
He passed away years ago.

50
00:04:20,998 --> 00:04:27,088
Well, at least you were lucky to have him.
Bow-wow, old friend. Bow-wow.

51
00:04:29,257 --> 00:04:32,593
- So where's the party?
- Out on the island. It's in Massapequa.

52
00:04:32,885 --> 00:04:38,558
Massapequa, it sounds magical.
Is it steeped in Native American history?

53
00:04:38,766 --> 00:04:40,977
Well, there is an Arby's
in the shape of a tepee.

54
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:45,231
- I've got my notes. You got the presents?
CHANDLER: Yeah.

55
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,275
- I've got the car keys.
- We're driving?

56
00:04:47,442 --> 00:04:49,444
- Yeah.
- Aces.

57
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:56,409
- So, uh, he seems like a nice guy.
- Yeah. Yeah, I like him a lot.

58
00:04:56,659 --> 00:05:01,581
- You want to hang back and take a cab?
- Okay, otherwise I'm not going.

ROSS <i>&</i> RACHEL: Hey.

61
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:13,468
- Hey, Mom.
- This is such a great party.

62
00:05:13,843 --> 00:05:18,806
Thirty-five years. Very impressive.
Do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?

63
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:23,561
- Jack?
- Why serve food on such a sharp stick?

64
00:05:24,312 --> 00:05:27,815
It's a good question, Dad.
It's a good question.

65
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:33,946
- Congratulations, you two.
- Thank you, we're so excited.

66
00:05:34,155 --> 00:05:36,574
And also, congratulations
on your wedding.

67
00:05:37,408 --> 00:05:38,576
What?

68
00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:42,663
- Can we talk to you for just a moment?
RACHEL: Yeah.

69
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:45,958
It's just a little thing.

70
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:50,838
While we think it's simply marvelous that
you're having this baby out of wedlock...

71
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:55,510
...some of our friends
are less open-minded.

72
00:05:55,718 --> 00:05:58,304
- Which is why we told them you're married.
- What?

73
00:05:58,513 --> 00:06:01,015
Thanks for going along with this.

74
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:06,521
- We have to pretend that we're married?
- Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight.

75
00:06:06,687 --> 00:06:08,022
You can do this.

76
00:06:09,732 --> 00:06:11,859
- Can you believe that?
- I know.

77
00:06:12,151 --> 00:06:16,489
If you're gonna do the ears, you may
as well take a pass at the nose area.

78
00:06:16,697 --> 00:06:19,992
No, no, I don't want to have to lie
about us being married.

79
00:06:20,201 --> 00:06:24,121
I know. I don't either.
But it's their party, and it's one night.

80
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,874
We don't even have to lie.
We just won't say anything.

81
00:06:27,124 --> 00:06:30,419
If it comes up, we'll smile,
we'll nod along...

- Rachel?

Congratulations on the baby
and on the wedding.

- Here's something to get you started.
- So how's marriage treating you?

86
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:50,022
- Unbelievable. It's great.
- I love marriage.

89
00:06:54,902 --> 00:06:57,905
What a beautiful place.
What a great night.

90
00:06:58,155 --> 00:07:02,410
I have to tell you, being here
with all of you in Event Room C...

91
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:08,791
...I feel so lucky. To think of all the
good times that have happened here.

92
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:14,088
The birthdays, the proms,
the mitzvahs, both bar and bat.

93
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:19,260
But none of it will compare with tonight.
My God, I don't want to forget this moment.

94
00:07:19,427 --> 00:07:23,639
It's like I want to take a mental
picture of you all. Click.

95
00:07:25,474 --> 00:07:28,603
I don't think the flash went off.

96
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:34,567
- I'm gonna go find the men's room.
- I'll go with you.

97
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:37,153
Somewhere, there is someone
with a tranquilizer gun...

98
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,072
...and a huge butterfly net
looking for that man.

99
00:07:41,616 --> 00:07:46,454
I have to go too, but I don't
want him complimenting my thing.

100
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:49,498
I'm so glad we weren't in the car.
Did he ever let up?

101
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:54,003
He called the Long Island Expressway
a concrete miracle.

102
00:07:54,587 --> 00:07:57,465
This room. This night.

103
00:07:57,757 --> 00:08:03,638
That waiter. His shoes.
I must take a mental picture.

104
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,473
Sorry.

105
00:08:09,143 --> 00:08:11,437
Were you guys making fun of Parker?

106
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:15,608
That depends, how much did you hear?

107
00:08:17,443 --> 00:08:20,279
Well, he's a little enthusiastic.
What's wrong with that?

108
00:08:20,446 --> 00:08:24,325
- It's just-- It's so much.
- Well, so what? I like him.

109
00:08:24,492 --> 00:08:28,663
Do I make fun of the people you've dated?
Tag, Janice, Mona.

110
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:33,292
No, because friends don't do that.
But do you want my opinion?

111
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:38,798
In my opinion, your collective dating record
reads like a who's who of human crap.

112
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:44,762
- I feel terrible.
- I know.

113
00:08:45,846 --> 00:08:47,765
What was wrong with Mona?

114
00:08:53,354 --> 00:08:56,023
- Open it, open it, open it.
- Yeah, baby.

115
00:08:56,273 --> 00:09:00,152
So we never got to hear
about your wedding.

116
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:05,282
- We were surprised we weren't invited.
- Oh, no, it was just our parents.

117
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:06,534
It was a small wedding.

118
00:09:06,701 --> 00:09:11,372
But it was beautiful.
It was small, but kind of spectacular.

119
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:16,377
- Where did you have it?
- On a cliff in Barbados, at sunset.

120
00:09:16,627 --> 00:09:20,715
And Stevie Wonder sang "isn't She Lovely"
as I walked down the aisle.

121
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:21,882
- Really?
- Yeah.

122
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:26,053
- Stevie's an old family friend.
- Oh, my God. That sounds amazing.

123
00:09:26,303 --> 00:09:30,057
- I'd love to see pictures.
- Yeah, so would I.

- Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.

You seem kind of quiet.

they'll be fighting for breath.

00:10:56,018 --> 00:10:59,730
You know, if you want to, I could just
hold them down and you could just:

146
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:06,654
And my veil was lace,
made by blind Belgian nuns.

147
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:10,324
- Blind?
- Well, not at first, but it was intricate work.

148
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:14,829
And they said even though they lost
their sight, it was all worth it.

149
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:18,666
- I bet you looked beautiful.
- Oh, well, I don't know about that.

I looked like a floating angel.

That's where we had our first date.

154
00:11:37,518 --> 00:11:43,190
Um, she walked in, and I had the room
filled with, uh, lilies, her favorite flower.

00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:47,653
AUNT LISA: That is so sweet.
- Shh. I want to hear the rest.
