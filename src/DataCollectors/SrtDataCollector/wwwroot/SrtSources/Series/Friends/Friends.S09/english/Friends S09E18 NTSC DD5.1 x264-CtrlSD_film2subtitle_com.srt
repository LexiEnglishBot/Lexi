1
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:09,241
Monica?
Hey, can l borrow the Porsche?

2
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,138
-Okay.
-All right!

3
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,711
But what is it not?

4
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,306
A place to entertain my lady friends.

5
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:22,411
-And what else is it not?
-A place to eat spaghetti.

6
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,216
Very good. What do you need
it for anyway?

7
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,859
The Powerball lottery
is up to 300 million...

8
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:32,531
-...and they don<i>'</i>t sell tickets here.
-So you<i>'</i>re driving up to Connecticut?

9
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:35,929
Yeah, Connecticut.
Not West Virginia.

10
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,769
Maybe l<i>'</i>ll drive you up there.
l<i>'</i>d like to buy some tickets myself.

11
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:45,339
Yeah, with Chandler not getting paid,
we could really use $300 million.

12
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:50,449
Yes, because if l was at my old job,
we<i>'</i>d say, ''300 million? No, thank you.''

13
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,344
-Will you get me tickets too?
-Yeah, me too.

14
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,216
-Sure.
-l have an idea.

15
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,654
Why don<i>'</i>t we all pitch in 50 bucks,
we<i>'</i>ll pool our money together...

16
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:03,523
-...and then if we win, we<i>'</i>ll split it.
-That<i>'</i>s a great idea!

17
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,396
No, thanks.

18
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,397
-You don<i>'</i>t wanna win the lottery?
-Sure l do.

19
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,594
l also want to be king
of my own country...

20
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:14,535
...and find out what happened
to Amelia Earhart.

21
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,304
-Still on Amelia Earhart?
-The woman just vanished!

22
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,810
Seriously, you don<i>'</i>t want in on this?

23
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,916
No. Do you know what your odds
are of winning the lottery?

24
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,714
l mean, you have a better chance
of being struck by lightning 42 times.

25
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,085
But there<i>'</i>s six of us, so we<i>'</i>d
only have to get struck 7 times.

26
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,486
l like those odds!

27
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:39,197
Seriously, you guys, l can<i>'</i>t believe
you<i>'</i>re gonna spend $250 on the lottery.

28
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:42,596
l mean, that<i>'</i>s such a bunch
of boo-hockey.

29
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,873
l<i>'</i>ll ask.

30
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,098
''Boo-hockey''?

31
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:53,238
Oh, we think Emma<i>'</i>s about
to start talking...

32
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:57,042
...so we<i>'</i>re trying to be careful about
what words we use in front of her.

33
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,411
So get ready to hear a lot
of boo-hockey...

34
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,180
...gosh darn it
and brother pucker.

35
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,825
How do you know
she<i>'</i>s gonna start talking?

36
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:09,859
When l talk to her, l almost feel
like she understands what l'm saying.

37
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,894
Kind of like Joey.

38
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,091
What<i>'</i>s that now?

39
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:10,282
God, look at all these tickets.
lt<i>'</i>s so exciting.

40
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,491
l haven<i>'</i>t won anything
since sixth grade.

41
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,990
Pie-eating contest?

42
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,321
You assume because l was heavy that<i>'</i>s
the only way l could win something?

43
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,525
No, l saw a picture
of you covered in blueberries.

44
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,569
-That was a good day.
-Yeah.

45
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:31,132
-They<i>'</i>re towing your car!
-l'm parked in a garage on Morton.

46
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,538
They<i>'</i>re towing a car.

47
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:38,445
And l am seeing spots.

48
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,313
Ross, you don<i>'</i>t have Emma!
Rachel, you don<i>'</i>t have Emma!

49
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,887
-Where<i>'</i>s Emma? Who has Emma?
-Joey, relax.

50
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:48,357
My mother picked her up two hours ago.
You were there.

51
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,160
-l was?
-Yes, and you talked to her.

52
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,659
-l did?
-She dropped off a casserole.

53
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,837
Oh, yeah, the casserole lady.

54
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,403
Did you come by to watch
us win the big bucks?

55
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:05,169
Yeah. And then l figured after you win,
we can all go out to the balcony...

56
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:09,782
...and see a night rainbow
with gremlins dancing on top of it.

57
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,249
Don<i>'</i>t touch the phone!
l<i>'</i>ll get it!

58
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,348
-You think he washed his hands?
-Hello?

59
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,888
-Hey, Charlie, what do you know?
-What<i>'</i>s going on?

60
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,323
Chandler<i>'</i>s supposed to find out
if he<i>'</i>s getting a job at his agency.

61
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,895
But out of 1 5 interns,
they<i>'</i>re only hiring three.

62
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,895
-Tough odds.
-Yeah.

63
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,866
lf only it were a sure thing
like your 24-state lottery.

64
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:35,704
Yeah, look who<i>'</i>s coming around!

65
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:39,605
Damn it. All right, call me
when you know more.

66
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,814
-Did you get it?
-One of the slots got filled.

67
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:48,754
-By you?
-Sense the tone.

68
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:53,583
-No, that kid Nate got it.
-Oh, l hate that guy.

69
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,991
l mean, come on, kid,
pull up your pants!

70
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,063
Well, there<i>'</i>s two spots left, right?

71
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,893
Yeah. l mean, l want this so much.
l wanna get one.

72
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,263
l want my friend Charlie
to get one.

73
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,530
Except l don<i>'</i>t care about Charlie.

74
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,466
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey!

75
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,406
You are not gonna believe this.
l just saw my psychic...

76
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:16,446
...and she said l was definitely
gonna win the lottery tonight!

77
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,910
l thought we could use
some extra luck...

78
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,111
...so l brought a wishbone home
from work.

79
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:28,784
A psychic and a wishbone?
Guys, give someone else a chance.

80
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,320
-All right, who wants to do it?
-Can l?

81
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,499
Vegetarians never get
to do the wishbone.

82
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,534
lt<i>'</i>s really not fair. Just because
we don<i>'</i>t eat the meat...

83
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,764
...doesn<i>'</i>t mean we don<i>'</i>t like
to play with the carcasses.

84
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,103
All right. Rach?

85
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,675
l don<i>'</i>t want that turkey smell
all over my hands.

86
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:49,439
l<i>'</i>ll do it! lt<i>'</i>ll get the casserole
stink off of mine.

87
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,512
-l hope l win.
-Well, it doesn<i>'</i>t really matter.

88
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,655
You<i>'</i>re both wishing
for the same thing.

89
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:01,623
l can<i>'</i>t tell you what l'm wishing for,
or else, you know, it won<i>'</i>t come true.

90
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,862
Right. But we know
what you<i>'</i>re wishing for.

91
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:08,033
-l can<i>'</i>t really say.
-l understand.

92
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,726
But you<i>'</i>re wishing
for what we think, aren<i>'</i>t you?

93
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,700
l'm not really comfortable
with these questions!

94
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,966
-Please!
-Just do it!

95
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,143
Okay. One, two, three.

96
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,211
l won! Hey!

97
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,508
You know what? l'm sure your
wish is gonna come true.

98
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:28,552
But, you guys, just in case, maybe a
genie will come out if we rub this lamp.

99
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,881
That thing gets hot!

100
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,719
Ross, just keep making your jokes.

101
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,123
How are you gonna feel
if we actually do win?

102
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,492
-You<i>'</i>re not gonna win.
-l know the odds are against us...

103
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:43,829
...but somebody has to win, and it could
be us. And then how you gonna feel?

104
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:47,734
We<i>'</i>re gonna be like, ''Everybody, let<i>'</i>s
take our helicopters up to the Cape.''

105
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,273
And you<i>'</i>re gonna be all,
like, ''Oh, l can<i>'</i>t, guys.

106
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,674
l<i>'</i>ll have to meet you up there.
l gotta gas up the Hyundai.''

107
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:01,845
Okay, l<i>'</i>ve heard myself on tape,
and l sound nothing like that.

108
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,215
l can see the headline now:
''Lottery Winners' Friend...

109
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,791
...Filled With Regret,
Eats Own Arm.''

110
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:09,961
Why would l eat my own arm?

111
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:13,757
Well, you wouldn<i>'</i>t, but we own the paper.
We can print whatever we want.

112
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,561
You know what? l'm gonna
throw in 50 bucks for you.

113
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,170
-Why?
-Because l know that you think...

114
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,398
...that the lottery is boo-hockey...

115
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:26,302
...but we<i>'</i>re all here, and we<i>'</i>re gonna
watch the numbers and have fun.

116
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,472
And you<i>'</i>re my brother,
and l want you to be a part of this.

117
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,914
You don<i>'</i>t have to do that.
l mean, l<i>'</i>ll pay for myself.

118
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:38,955
But just the fact that you want me to
have fun with you guys, that<i>'</i>s so sweet.

119
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,752
Come here.

120
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,262
Get a room.

121
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,262
So now that you<i>'</i>re in,
what are you gonna do if we win?

122
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:55,100
-l don<i>'</i>t know. l<i>'</i>ll probably just invest it.
-Calm down.

123
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,072
Seriously, that<i>'</i>s your fantasy?
To invest it?

124
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:02,976
Oh, l'm sorry. Did l say, ''invest it''?
l meant, ''Be cool and piss it all away.''

125
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:08,913
l know! We should pool all
our money and buy the Knicks!

126
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,120
l don<i>'</i>t really care about the Knicks.

127
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,259
You will when l pick you
as starting forward.

128
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,653
You would do that?
l never get picked!

129
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,189
l'm not sure a sports team
is the way to go.

130
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:24,734
You won't let me buy the Knicks?
l can<i>'</i>t believe you<i>'</i>re taking this away.

131
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,963
You<i>'</i>re right, it has been your dream
for over 1 5 seconds.

132
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:33,233
How long until they announce
the numbers, Mommy?

133
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:37,773
l<i>'</i>ll take this one too.
''Mommy''?

134
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,976
Oh, l<i>'</i>ve gotten into the habit
of calling Rachel...

135
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,212
...''Mommy'' when we<i>'</i>re around Emma.

136
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:47,291
Which l now realize we are not.

137
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:51,830
l'm hoping that if she hears it enough,
it<i>'</i>ll be her first word.

138
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:56,195
Although if we<i>'</i>re gonna do that,
we should probably call me ''Daddy'' too.

139
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,193
l like that, Daddy.

140
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,810
l was just talking about Rachel.

141
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,879
ls Daddy getting angry?

142
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,411
ls Daddy gonna spank me?

143
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,584
Well, that depends.

144
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,520
Have you been a bad--?
No, l can<i>'</i>t.

145
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:28,194
Hello? Hello? Hey, Charlie.
Did anybody else hear?

146
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,726
What? Susan got it? How?

147
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,032
Oh, man, l would<i>'</i>ve slept with him!

148
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,833
All right, bye.

149
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,039
Dude, l'm sorry.
But hey, there<i>'</i>s one spot left, right?

150
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,909
-Well, Charlie<i>'</i>s gonna get that.
-Hey, don<i>'</i>t say that.

151
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,745
You<i>'</i>ve got just as good a chance
of getting that job.

152
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,614
He is the boss<i>'</i> son.

153
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,713
-Come on, lottery!
-Yeah!

154
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,587
-lt starts in, like, 20 minutes.
-Okay, here we go.

155
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,127
We need to sort through the tickets
quickly to see if we've won.

156
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,027
So does anybody have any ideas
how to organize this?

157
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,361
Okay, how about this:

158
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,195
We divide them
into six groups of 40.

159
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,398
The remaining 1 0 can be read
by whoever finishes first.

160
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,373
-l have another idea.
-l'm sorry, idea time is over.

161
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,915
-Well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
-Yeah.

162
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,574
-What about the ones on the nightstand?
-There are no tickets there.

163
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,550
Yes, there are.
l just saw them a few minutes ago.

164
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,121
No, you didn<i>'</i>t.
You must be mistaken.

165
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:31,093
-There are 20 tickets on the nightstand.
-Chandler, sense the tone.

166
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:36,963
Well, well, well.
Look what Mommy found.

167
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:41,304
Okay, fine. l bought 20 extra
tickets for me and Chandler.

168
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,235
The psychic also said that
l would be betrayed.

169
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,813
l can<i>'</i>t believe this.
l thought we were all in this together.

170
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:53,349
-Hey, you just got in five minutes ago!
-Three minutes ago!

171
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,079
l don<i>'</i>t know why that<i>'</i>s important.

172
00:10:56,288 --> 00:11:00,418
l was with you the whole time.
When did you even get those?

173
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:05,120
When you were reading the dirty
magazines without taking off the plastic.

174
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,193
l<i>'</i>ll show you how.

175
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,466
Okay. Well, Monica, suppose one
of your special tickets wins?

176
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,470
How are you gonna feel when you win
and lose your friends?

177
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,474
Please. lf l win the lottery,
you guys are not gonna leave me.

178
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:22,808
Someone gave me muffins last week, and
l couldn<i>'</i>t get rid of you for three days!

179
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,113
Chandler, would you just tell her
what she did was wrong?

180
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:30,186
She<i>'</i>s right. You shouldn<i>'</i>t have
bought tickets just for us.

181
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,015
Let me finish.

182
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,819
However, it doesn<i>'</i>t look like
l'm gonna get this job...

183
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:39,328
...so l can<i>'</i>t afford to have principles.
So screw you! The tickets are ours!

184
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,859
There<i>'</i>s the man l married.

185
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,399
All right. Believe me,
if you win the lottery...

186
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,562
...it<i>'</i>s the last you<i>'</i>re gonna hear
from us.

187
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:52,506
Fine. Don<i>'</i>t be my friends.
l<i>'</i>ll buy new friends.

188
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:57,682
Yeah, and then l<i>'</i>ll pay for their plastic
surgery so they look just like you!

189
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,478
You know what?
l want my share of the tickets.

190
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,144
l want my tickets too!
And l'm buying the Knicks!

191
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,756
And Steffi Graf!

192
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,324
Cool. Then l want mine too!
And if l win...

193
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,657
...l'm gonna put it all
into a very low-yield bond!

194
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:16,198
No. You guys, we gotta keep
all the tickets together.

195
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,393
No. No, we should divide them up...

196
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,005
...and l should get extra because
we used my car!

197
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,903
Hey! Hey! lf anybody gets extra tickets,
it should be me!

198
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:28,706
-This whole thing was my idea!
-Yeah. Thanks for inventing the lottery!

199
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,250
Just give them to me,
and l<i>'</i>ll split them up!

200
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,679
Hey, hey!

201
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:40,382
God, l can<i>'</i>t take it anymore!
l'm putting an end to this!

202
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,926
-Okay, if she jumps, l get her tickets!
-Wait, no, no! Hey!

203
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:48,723
lf we<i>'</i>re not doing this together,
we<i>'</i>re not doing it at all.

204
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,233
-Say goodbye to your tickets.
-No! No! No!

205
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,031
Do not come any closer!

206
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:57,903
Can l come a little bit closer?
Valuable things are getting squished.

207
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,772
Now, what<i>'</i>s more important,
your friends or money?

208
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,379
-Friends!
-Money!

209
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,243
Friends.

210
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,555
Hey, Monica,
what about your extra tickets?

211
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,554
They<i>'</i>re all in there.

212
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,826
-Even these five that l hid in my bra.
-Monica!

213
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,828
Okay. Good. You guys were so scared.

214
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,831
There is no way l was
gonna dump this--

215
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,334
God! No!

216
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,970
l think l broke your bowl.

217
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,940
Go! Go! Go!

218
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:51,324
What a beautiful night to be running
around the street, looking for tickets.

219
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,292
And the wind sure made it fun.

220
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,534
-Phoebe, we lost half of them.
-So what?

221
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,864
Monica, we have the winning ticket.

222
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:03,508
My psychic said l was
gonna win, remember?

223
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:08,204
Weird your psychic didn<i>'</i>t mention
anything about the scary pigeon.

224
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:12,543
As a matter of fact, she said
that<i>'</i>s how l'm going to die.

225
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:17,018
So excuse me
for being a little skittish.

226
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,350
There<i>'</i>s two messages.
This could be from work.

227
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,222
-Oh, play them.
-Okay. Here we go.

228
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:30,132
<i>Hello. This is the pigeon from</i>
<i>the balcony calling to apologize.</i>

229
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:36,041
<i>I shouldn</i>'<i>t have knocked the tickets</i>
<i>out of the pretty lady</i>'<i>s hand.</i>

230
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:41,237
<i>It was all my fault.</i>
<i>Not hers. Bye.</i>

231
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,249
Well, l bet that was very hard
for him to do.

232
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,019
<i>Hey, Chandler, it</i>'<i>s Charlie.</i>

233
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,058
This is it.

234
00:14:56,228 --> 00:15:00,392
<i>Listen, it turns out I got the last spot.</i>

235
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,399
<i>I'm really sorry, man.</i>
<i>It was a lot of fun working with you.</i>

236
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,037
<i>Give me a call if you want.</i>

237
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,935
Gosh, l'm so sorry, honey.

238
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,665
Sorry, Chandler.

239
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:15,746
lt is so unfair. lt<i>'</i>s like that time they
promoted Saundra over me at work.

240
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,677
Was she related to Ralph Lauren?

241
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:21,546
No, she was just much better
at her job than me.

242
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:24,153
You guys, the drawing<i>'</i>s
about to start.

243
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,757
We should call my mom<i>'</i>s
and say good night to Emma...

244
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,951
-...before she goes down.
-Good idea.

245
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,259
Honey, you<i>'</i>re being really strong
about this.

246
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,956
l know how badly you wanted that job.

247
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,964
Yeah, you know, l really
thought l deserved it.

248
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:43,572
But let<i>'</i>s go win the lottery. l mean, we
still have a 1 30 chances to win, right?

249
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,610
Hundred and thirty-one.

250
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:51,243
Yeah, good night, sweetheart.
l love you.

251
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:55,251
And remember,
you<i>'</i>re Daddy<i>'</i>s little girl.

252
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:58,413
Phoebe<i>'</i>s totally ruined that for me.

253
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,217
Hi, Mom. Put her back on.

254
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,386
Rach, they<i>'</i>re announcing
the numbers!

255
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,589
My God, l can already feel
myself changing.

256
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:13,904
<i>Here are your official Powerball</i>
<i>numbers. We have 53.</i>

257
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,597
-l<i>'</i>ve got that.
-We have one too!

258
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,573
We are on the road, people!

259
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:21,937
Come on!

260
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:27,608
Mom, please, l know you love your new
lips, but l can barely understand you.

261
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,914
Would you please just let me
say good night to my daughter?

262
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,489
<i>And here we go.</i>
<i>The Powerball is seven.</i>

263
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:37,423
All right, check your numbers!
Make me rich.

264
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,855
You guys,
you<i>'</i>re not gonna believe this.

265
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:44,434
l was just saying good night
to Emma, and she said her first words.

266
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,737
-What?
-Well, what did she say?

267
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,772
She said, ''Gleba'' !

268
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,842
Make me rich!

269
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,849
-lsn<i>'</i>t that amazing?
-Oh, yeah. No, no, no, that<i>'</i>s great.

270
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,748
Why aren<i>'</i>t you more excited?

271
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:06,185
Rach, gleba is not a word.

272
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:10,618
-Well, of course it is.
-Okay. What does it mean?

273
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,855
Well, l don<i>'</i>t know all the words.

274
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,724
You know, l'm just glad l didn<i>'</i>t
miss my daughter<i>'</i>s first word.

275
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:22,272
-Yes you did! Gleba is a word!
-Okay. Use it in a sentence.

276
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:26,274
Okay. Emma just said, ''Gleba.''

277
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:33,307
-lt<i>'</i>s not a word.
-Okay, fine. l'm gonna look it up.

278
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,009
Okay, great.

279
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,314
While you<i>'</i>re at it,
she said another word the other day.

280
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,515
Why don<i>'</i>t you look up:

281
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,199
All right. Okay. Okay. Gleba.
Gleba. Gleba. Gleba!

282
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:54,805
Here it is! ''The fleshy, spore-bearing
inner mass of a certain fungi.''

283
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,105
She<i>'</i>s gonna be a scientist.

284
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,914
-Damn it. Anybody got anything?
-No.

285
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,253
l'm still looking through mine.

286
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,624
Just double-checking. No.

287
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,732
No. No.

288
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,597
No!

289
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,608
Hello? Hold on.

290
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,042
lt<i>'</i>s your boss.

291
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,775
The ''l'm sorry l rejected you'' phone call.

292
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,579
l'm not used to getting these
from guys.

293
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,112
-Hey, Steve.
-Chandler, hi.

294
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,225
l'm sure you<i>'</i>ve heard
we filled the three positions.

295
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,725
We felt that with your
maturity and experience...

296
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,364
...you wouldn<i>'</i>t be happy
being someone<i>'</i>s assistant.

297
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:56,125
l<i>'</i>d love to be somebody<i>'</i>s
assistant. Answering phones...

298
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,132
...getting coffee,
l live for that stuff.

299
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:03,240
And l<i>'</i>m not too mature.
Farts, boobies, butt cracks!

300
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,576
Chandler, you were the strongest
person in the program.

301
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:12,183
We<i>'</i>re offering you the position
of junior copywriter.

302
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,649
Me? That guy
who just said, ''butt cracks''?

303
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,016
<i>Yes, that</i>'<i>s right.</i>

304
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,589
We<i>'</i>re excited about the level
of sophistication...

305
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,091
...you<i>'</i>ll be bringing to the job.

306
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:28,159
Okay. Well, thanks, you won<i>'</i>t regret it.
l<i>'</i>ll see you tomorrow.

307
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,307
What?

308
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,211
Oh, yeah, l'm gonna
be a junior copywriter.

309
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,487
Congratulations!
Oh, sweetie, l'm so proud of you.

310
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,283
Thanks. Does that mean
l get the good loving tonight?

311
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:56,291
You bet. No TV or anything.

312
00:19:56,962 --> 00:20:00,295
-Hey, that is so great about the job.
-Thanks, man.

313
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,626
l<i>'</i>d like to think l had
something to do with it.

314
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:06,031
-Really? Why?
-Well, before with the wishbone.

315
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:11,973
l didn<i>'</i>t wish we would win the lottery.
l wished you<i>'</i>d get the job.

316
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,469
Oh, yeah?

317
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,316
Listen, don<i>'</i>t tell Monica.
She<i>'</i>ll rip your heart right out.

318
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,477
Well, you know what?
There was a little part of me...

319
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,714
...that really thought
we were gonna win.

320
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:32,386
Me too. So much for my
dinosaur/ Amelia Earhart theme park.

321
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,990
You guys? What was the Powerball
number again?

322
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,729
-Seven.
-We won.

323
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,835
-What?
-We won!

324
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,703
-Let me see! Let me see!
-Don<i>'</i>t tear it!

325
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,877
Phoebe, you don<i>'</i>t have any
of the first five numbers!

326
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:56,217
l know that, but look, we got
the Powerball number. We won $3!

327
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:01,185
Wow, you think we should get that over
20 years or go for the big payout?

328
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,990
l don<i>'</i>t care. l<i>'</i>ve never won
anything before. l can<i>'</i>t believe this!

329
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,428
So, Pheebs, what are you gonna do
with your $3?

330
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:12,900
Well, it<i>'</i>s not all mine.
We all get 50 cents.

331
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,432
You know what?
You can have mine.

332
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,869
-Me too.
-Me too.

333
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,272
Me too.

334
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,949
Well, l guess if everybody else is.

335
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,997
Hey, guys. So l just called
the Powerball hot line.

336
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:44,462
-Can you believe it? Nobody won.
-l beg to differ.

337
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,600
Maybe nobody won the jackpot,
but there was this guy in here earlier...

338
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:54,678
...and he found a ticket on the street
right outside and won $ 1 0,000.

339
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:09,317
Again, don<i>'</i>t blame the pretty lady.

340
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:14,632
lt was not her fault.
lt was me, the pigeon.

341
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:20,194
Seriously, stop staring at her.

342
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,839
