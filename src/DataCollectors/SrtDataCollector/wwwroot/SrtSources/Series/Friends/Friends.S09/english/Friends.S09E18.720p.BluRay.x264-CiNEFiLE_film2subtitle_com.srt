1
00:00:07,383 --> 00:00:10,344
Monica?
Hey, can I borrow the Porsche?

2
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,263
- Okay.
- All right!

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,849
But, uh, ahem, what is it not?

4
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:18,436
A place to entertain my lady friends.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,524
- And what else is it not?
- A place to eat spaghetti.

6
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,234
- Very good.
- Thanks.

7
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:28,988
- What do you need it for anyway?
- The, uh, lottery is up to 300 million...

8
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:33,659
- ...and they don't sell tickets here.
- So you're driving up to Connecticut?

9
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:37,038
Yeah, Connecticut.
Not West Virginia.

10
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:41,876
Maybe I'll drive you up there.
I'd like to buy some tickets myself.

11
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:46,464
Yeah, with Chandler not getting paid,
we could really use $300 million.

12
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:51,552
Yes, because if I was at my old job,
we'd say, "300 million? No, thank you."

13
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,473
- Will you get me tickets too?
- Yeah, me too.

14
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,349
- Sure.
- Ooh! I have an idea.

15
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:00,770
Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks,
we'll pool our money together...

16
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:04,648
- ...and then if we win, we'll split it.
- That's a great idea!

17
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,526
No, thanks.

18
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:10,529
- You don't want to win the lottery?
- Uh, sure I do.

19
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,698
I also want to be king
of my own country...

20
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,659
...and find out what happened
to Amelia Earhart.

21
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:19,413
- Still on Amelia Earhart?
- The woman just vanished!

22
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:22,917
Seriously, you don't want in on this?

23
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:26,045
No. Do you know what your odds
are of winning the lottery?

24
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:29,840
I mean, you have a better chance
of being struck by lightning 42 times.

25
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:33,219
But there's six of us, so we'd
only have to get struck 7 times.

26
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,596
I like those odds!

27
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:40,309
Seriously, you guys, I can't believe
you're gonna spend $250 on the lottery.

28
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:43,729
I mean, that's such a bunch
of boo-hockey.

29
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,984
I'll ask.

30
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,237
"Boo-hockey"?

31
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,365
Oh, we think Emma's about
to start talking...

32
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:58,160
...so we're trying to be careful about
what words we use in front of her.

33
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:00,538
So get ready to hear a lot
of, uh, boo-hockey...

34
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,290
...gosh darn it
and brother pucker.

35
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,919
How do you know
she's gonna start talking?

36
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:10,381
When I talk to her, I almost feel
like she understands what I'm saying.

37
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:13,008
Kind of like Joey.

38
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,220
What's that now?

39
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,068
God, look at all these tickets.
It's so exciting.

40
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,237
I haven't won anything
since sixth grade.

41
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:17,740
Pie-eating contest?

42
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:23,078
You assume because I was heavy that's
the only way I could win something?

43
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:26,290
No, I saw a picture
of you covered in blueberries.

44
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,335
- That was a good day.
- Yeah.

45
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,881
- They're towing your car!
- I'm parked in a garage on Morton.

46
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,301
They're towing a car.

47
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:41,180
And I am seeing spots.

48
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,058
Ross, you don't have Emma!
Rachel, you don't have Emma!

49
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,644
- Where's Emma? Who has Emma?
- Joey, relax.

50
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,106
My mother picked her up two hours ago.
You were there.

51
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,902
- I was?
- Yes, and you talked to her.

52
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,405
- I did?
- She dropped off a casserole.

53
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:01,575
Oh, yeah, the casserole lady.

54
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,161
Did you come by to watch
us win the big bucks?

55
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,915
Yeah. And then I figured after you win,
we can all go out to the balcony...

56
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:11,627
...and see a night rainbow
with gremlins dancing on top of it.

57
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,006
Don't touch the phone!
I'll get it! I'll get it!

58
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:19,093
- You think he washed his hands?
- Hello?

59
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,637
- Hey, Charlie, what do you know?
- What's going on?

60
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:25,057
Chandler's supposed to find out if he's
getting a job at his agency.

61
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:27,643
But out of 15 interns,
they're only hiring three.

62
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,645
- Ooh. Tough odds.
- Yeah.

63
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:33,607
If only it were a sure thing
like your 24-state lottery.

64
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,445
Yeah, look who's coming around!

65
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:42,366
Damn it. All right, call me
when you know more.

66
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,578
- Did you get it?
- One of the slots got filled.

67
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:51,500
- By you?
- Sense the tone.

68
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,338
- No, that kid Nate got it.
- Oh, I hate that guy.

69
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,758
- I mean, come on, pull up your pants!
- I know.

70
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,802
Well, there's two spots left, right?

71
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:04,638
Yeah. I mean, I want this so much.
I want to get one.

72
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,016
I want my friend Charlie
to get one.

73
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,268
Except I don't care about Charlie.

74
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,229
Hey!

75
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,149
You are not gonna believe this.
I just saw my psychic...

76
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:19,194
...and she said I was definitely
gonna win the lottery tonight!

77
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,656
I thought we could use
some extra luck...

78
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,867
...so I brought a wishbone home
from work.

79
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:31,540
A psychic and a wishbone?
Guys, give someone else a chance.

80
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,084
- All right, who wants to do it?
- Ooh, can I?

81
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:37,254
Vegetarians never get
to do the wishbone.

82
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:40,257
It's really not fair.
Just because we don't eat the meat...

83
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:43,510
...doesn't mean we don't like
to play with the carcasses.

84
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,846
All right. Rash'?

85
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:48,432
I don't want that turkey smell
all over my hands.

86
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,186
I'll do it! It'll get the casserole
stink off of mine.

87
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,274
- I hope I win.
- Well, it doesn't really matter.

88
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,401
You're both wishing
for the same thing.

89
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,365
I can't tell you what I'm wishing for, or else,
you know, it won't come true. Ha, ha.

90
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,618
Right. But we know
what you're wishing for.

91
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,788
- I can't really say.
- I understand.

92
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,499
But you're wishing
for what we think, aren't you?

93
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,460
I'm not really comfortable
with these questions!

94
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,712
- Please!
- Just do it!

95
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,881
Okay. One, two, three.

96
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,966
I won! Hey!

97
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:26,261
You know what? I'm sure your
wish is gonna come true.

98
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,973
But, you guys, just in case, maybe a
genie will come out if we rub this lamp.

99
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,683
Qw!

100
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,645
That thing gets hot!

101
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:36,480
Ross, just keep making yourjokes.

102
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,857
How are you gonna feel
if we actually do win?

103
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,236
- Uh, you're not gonna win.
- I know the odds are against us...

104
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:46,573
...but somebody has to win, and it could
be us. And then how you gonna feel?

105
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,494
We're gonna be like, "Everybody, let's
take our helicopters up to the Cape."

106
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:53,038
And you're gonna be all,
like, "Oh, I can't, guys.

107
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:56,417
I'll have to meet you up there.
I gotta gas up the Hyundai."

108
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:04,591
Okay, I've heard myself on tape,
and I sound nothing like that.

109
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,970
I can see the headline now:
"Lottery Winners' Friend...

110
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:10,556
...Filled With Regret,
Eats Own Arm."

111
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,724
Why would I eat my own arm?

112
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,520
Well, you wouldn't, but we own the
paper. We can print whatever we want.

113
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,314
You know what? I'm gonna
throw in 50 bucks for you.

114
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,900
- Why?
- Because I know that you think...

115
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,154
...that the lottery is boo-hockey...

116
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:29,074
...but we're all here, and we're gonna
watch the numbers and have fun.

117
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:33,245
And you're my brother,
and I want you to be a part of this.

118
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:37,666
You don't have to do that.
I mean, I'll pay for myself.

119
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,712
But just the fact that you want me to
have fun with you guys, that's so sweet.

120
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,505
Come here.

121
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:47,009
Get a room.

122
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,015
So now that you're in,
what are you gonna do if we win?

123
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:57,853
- I don't know. I'll probably just invest it.
- Ooh. Calm down.

124
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,814
Seriously, that's your fantasy?
To invest it?

125
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:05,736
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say, "invest it"?
I meant, "Be cool and piss it all away."

126
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:11,658
Oh! Oh! I know! We should pool all
our money and buy the Knicks!

127
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,869
I don't really care about the Knicks.

128
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,997
You will when I pick you
as starting forward.

129
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:21,418
You would do that?
I never get picked!

130
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,795
I'm not sure a sports team
is the way to go.

131
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:27,466
You won't let me buy the Knicks?
I can't believe you're taking this away.

132
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:30,802
You're right, it has been your dream
for over 15 seconds.

133
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,974
Uh, how long until they announce
the numbers, Mommy?

134
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:40,729
I'll take this one too. Uh, "Mommy"?

135
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,941
Oh, I've gotten into the habit
of calling Rachel "Mommy"...

136
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,984
...when we're around Emma.

137
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:50,030
Which I now realize we are not.

138
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,075
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough...

139
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,576
- ...it'll be her first word.
- Oh.

140
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,829
Although if we're gonna do that,
we should probably call me "Daddy" too.

141
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:01,959
Mm. I like that, Daddy.

142
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:08,549
I, uh... I was just talking about Rachel.

143
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,842
Ooh, is Daddy getting angry?

144
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,181
Is Daddy gonna spank me?

145
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,352
Well, that depends.

146
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,272
Have you been a bad...? No, I can't.

147
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,946
Hello? Hello? Hey, Charlie.
Did anybody else hear?

148
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,491
What? Susan got it? How?

149
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,786
Oh, man, I would've slept with him!

150
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,581
All right, bye.

151
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,792
Dude, I'm sorry.
But hey, there's one spot left, right?

152
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,670
- Well, Charlie's gonna get that.
- Hey, don't say that.

153
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:49,506
You've got just as good a chance
of getting that job.

154
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,383
He is the boss' son.

155
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,469
- Come on, lottery!
- Yeah!

156
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:57,347
- It starts in, like, 20 minutes.
- Okay, here we go.

157
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,892
We need to sort through the tickets
quickly to see if we've won.

158
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,770
So does anybody have any ideas
how to organize this?

159
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,106
Okay, how about this:

160
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,942
We divide them
into six groups of 40.

161
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,154
The remaining 10 can be read
by whoever finishes first.

162
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,115
- I have another idea.
- I'm sorry, idea time is over.

163
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,661
- Well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
- Yeah.

164
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,332
- What about the ones on the nightstand?
- There are no tickets there.

165
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,834
Yes, there are.
I just saw them a few minutes ago.

166
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:30,380
Heh. Uh, no, you didn't.
You must be mistaken.

167
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,842
- There are 20 tickets on the nightstand.
- Chandler, sense the tone.

168
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,723
Well, well, well.
Look what Mommy found.

169
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:44,102
Okay, fine. I bought 20 extra
tickets for me and Chandler.

170
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,981
The psychic also said
that I would be betrayed.

171
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,569
I can't believe this.
I thought we were all in this together.

172
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:56,114
- Hey, you just got in five minutes ago!
- Three minutes ago!

173
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,825
I don't know why that's important.

174
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:03,163
I was with you the whole time.
When did you even get those?

175
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:07,876
When you were reading the dirty
magazines without taking off the plastic.

176
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,961
I'll show you how.

177
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:14,216
Okay. Well, Monica, suppose one
of your special tickets wins?

178
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:17,219
How are you gonna feel when you win
and lose your friends?

179
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:21,223
Please. If I win the lottery,
you guys are not gonna leave me.

180
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,560
Someone gave me muffins last week.
I couldn't get rid of you for three days!

181
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:29,856
Chandler, would you just tell her
what she did was wrong?

182
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,943
She's right. You shouldn't have
bought tickets just for us.

183
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,778
Let me finish.

184
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:37,572
However, it doesn't look like
I'm gonna get this job...

185
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:42,077
...so I can't afford to have principles.
So screw you! The tickets are ours!

186
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,622
There's the man I married.

187
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,166
All right. Believe me,
if you win the lottery...

188
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,335
...it's the last you're gonna hear from us.

189
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:55,257
Fine. Don't be my friends.
I'll buy new friends.

190
00:11:55,507 --> 00:12:00,429
Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic
surgery so they look just like you!

191
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,223
You know what?
I want my share of the tickets.

192
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,892
I want my tickets too!
And I'm buying the Knicks!

193
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,520
And Steffi Graf! Ha, ha.

194
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,064
Cool. Then I want mine too!
And if I win...

195
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,401
...I'm gonna put it all
into a very low-yield bond!

196
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:18,947
No. You guys, we gotta keep
all the tickets together.

197
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,158
No. No, we should divide them up...

198
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,744
...and I should get extra because
we used my car!

199
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,663
Hey! Hey! If anybody gets extra tickets,
it should be me!

200
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,460
- This whole thing was my idea!
- Yeah. Thanks for inventing the lottery!

201
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,046
Just give them to me,
and I'll split them up!

202
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,215
Aw!
- Ah!

203
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,426
ROSSI Hey, hey!
- Aah!

204
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,138
God, I can't take it anymore!
I'm putting an end to this!

205
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:46,683
- Okay, if she jumps, I get her tickets!
- Wait, no, no! Hey!

206
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:51,480
If we're not doing this together,
we're not doing it at all.

207
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,982
- Say goodbye to your tickets.
- No! No! No!

208
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:56,777
Do not come any closer!

209
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:00,655
Can I come a little bit closer?
Valuable things are getting squished.

210
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,533
Now, what's more important,
your friends or money?

211
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:06,119
- Fflends!
- Money!

212
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,999
Fflends.

213
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,294
Hey, Monica,
what about your extra tickets?

214
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,505
They're all in there.

215
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:20,592
- Even these five that I hid in my bra.
- Monica!

216
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,595
Okay. Good. You guys were so scared.

217
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,598
There is no way I was
gonna dump this...

218
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:29,392
- Aah!

219
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,731
I think I broke your bowl.

220
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,692
Go! Go! Go!

221
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,378
What a beautiful night to be running
around the street, looking for tickets.

222
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,339
And the wind sure made it fun.

223
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,634
- Phoebe, we lost half of them.
- So what?

224
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,928
Monica, we have the winning ticket.

225
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:08,557
My psychic said I was
gonna win, remember?

226
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:12,477
Weird your psychic didn't mention
anything about the scary pigeon.

227
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:17,607
As a matter of fact, she said
that's how I'm going to die.

228
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:22,070
So excuse me
for being a little skittish.

229
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,406
There's two messages.
This could be from work.

230
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:27,951
- Oh, play them.
- Okay. Here we go.

231
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:35,166
Hello. This is the pigeon
from the balcony calling to apologize.

232
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:41,089
I shouldn't have knocked the tickets
out of the pretty lady's hand.

233
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:46,303
It was all my fault.
Not hers. Bye. Coo.

234
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,353
Well, I bet that was very hard
for him to do.

235
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,065
Hey, Chandler, it's Charlie.

236
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,109
This is it. Shh, Shh!

237
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:05,447
Listen, um, it turns out I got the last spot.

238
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:08,450
I'm really sorry, man.
It was a lot of fun working with you

239
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:11,077
Give me a call if you want.

240
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,997
Gosh, I'm so sorry, honey.

241
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,707
Sorry, Chandler.

242
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:20,795
It is so unfair. It's like that time they
promoted Saundra over me at work.

243
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,714
Was she related to Ralph Lauren?

244
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:26,593
No, she was just much better
at her job than me.

245
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,637
You guys, the drawing's about to start.

246
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:31,806
We should call my mom's
and say good night to Emma...

247
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,017
- ...before she goes down.
- Good idea.

248
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,312
Honey, you're being really strong
about this.

249
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:40,023
I know how badly you wanted that job.

250
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:43,026
Yeah, you know,
I really thought I deserved it.

251
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:48,615
But let's go win the lottery. I mean,
we still have a 130 chances to win, right?

252
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,661
Hundred and thirty-one.

253
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,289
Yeah, good night, sweetheart.
I love you.

254
00:15:56,456 --> 00:16:00,293
And remember,
you're Daddy's little girl. Heh.

255
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,129
Phoebe's totally ruined that for me.

256
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,259
Hi, Mom. Put her back on.

257
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,428
Rach, they're announcing the numbers!

258
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:14,641
My God, I can already feel
myself changing.

259
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,937
Here are your official Powerball
numbers. We have 53.

260
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,648
- I've got that.
- We have one too!

261
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,609
We are on the road, people!

262
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:26,987
Come on!

263
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:32,659
Mom, please, I know you love your new
lips, but I can barely understand you.

264
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:35,954
Would you please just let me
say good night to my daughter?

265
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,540
And here we go.
The Powerball is seven.

266
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:42,460
All right, check your numbers!
Make me rich.

267
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,922
You guys,
you're not gonna believe this.

268
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,467
I was just saying good night
to Emma, and she said her first words.

269
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,761
- What?
- Well, what did she say?

270
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,806
She said, "Gleba"!

271
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,895
Make me rich!

272
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,899
- Isn't that amazing?
- Oh, yeah. No, no, no, that's great.

273
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,776
Why aren't you more excited?

274
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:11,239
Rach, heh, "gleba" is not a word.

275
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:15,660
- Well, of course it is.
- Okay. What does it mean?

276
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,913
Well, I don't know all the words.

277
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:22,792
You know, I'm just glad I didn't
miss my daughter's first word.

278
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,297
- Yes you did! Gleba is a word!
- Okay. Use it in a sentence.

279
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:31,301
Okay. Uh, Emma just said, "Gleba

280
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:38,349
- It's not a word.
- Ugh. Okay, fine. I'm gonna look it up.

281
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,060
Oh, okay, great.

282
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:43,980
While you're at it, she said another word
the other day. Why don't you look up:

283
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:54,240
All right. Okay. Okay. Gleba
Gleba. Gleba. Gleba!

284
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:59,829
Here it is! "The fleshy, spore-bearing
inner mass of a certain fungi."

285
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,584
Heh.

286
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:08,171
She's gonna be a scientist.

287
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,972
- Damn it. Anybody got anything?
- No.

288
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,308
I'm still looking through mine.

289
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:23,686
Just double-checking. No.

290
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,773
No. No.

291
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,655
No!

292
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,661
Hello? Hold on.

293
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:40,870
It's your boss.

294
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,832
Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you"
phone call.

295
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,626
I'm not used to getting these
from guys.

296
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,171
- Hey, Steve.
- Chandler, hi.

297
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:53,258
I'm sure you've heard
we filled the three positions.

298
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,760
We felt that with your
maturity and experience...

299
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,388
...you wouldn't be happy
being someone's assistant.

300
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,182
I'd love to be somebody's
assistant. Answering phones...

301
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,184
...getting coffee,
I live for that stuff.

302
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:08,273
And I'm not too mature.
Farts, boobies, butt cracks!

303
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,611
Chandler, you were the strongest
person in the program.

304
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:17,240
We're offering you the position
of junior copywriter.

305
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,703
Me? That guy
who just said, "butt cracks"?

306
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,079
Yes, that's right.

307
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,623
We're excited about the level
of sophistication...

308
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,126
...you'll be bringing to the job.

309
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:33,214
Okay. Well, thanks, you won't regret it.
I'll see you tomorrow.

310
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,353
What?

311
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,480
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna
be a junior copywriter!

312
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:54,527
Congratulations!
Oh, sweetie, I'm so proud of you.

313
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,322
Thanks. Does that mean
I get the good loving tonight?

314
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:01,326
You bet. No TV or anything.

315
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:05,330
- Hey, that is so great about the job.
- Thanks, man.

316
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,665
I'd like to think I had
something to do with it.

317
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:11,085
- Really? Why?
- Well, before with the wishbone.

318
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:17,008
I, uh, didn't wish we would win the lottery.
I wished you'd get the job.

319
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,510
Oh, yeah?

320
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,888
Don't tell Monica.
She'll rip your heart out.

321
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,264
Oh, yeah.

322
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,519
Well, you know what?
There was a little part of me...

323
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,772
...that really thought we were gonna win.

324
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:37,445
Me too. So much for my
dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.

325
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:42,033
You guys? What was the Powerball
number again?

326
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,786
- Seven.
- We won.

327
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,871
- What?
- We won!

328
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,749
- Let me see! Let me see!
- Don't tear it!

329
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:53,920
Phoebe, you don't have any
of the first five numbers!

330
00:20:55,004 --> 00:21:01,261
I know that, but look, we got
the Powerball number. We won $3!

331
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:06,224
Wow, you think we should get that over
20 years or go for the big payout?

332
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:11,020
I don't care. I've never won
anything before. I can't believe this!

333
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:13,481
So, Pheebs, what are you gonna do
with your $3?

334
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,818
Well, it's not all mine.
We all get 50 cents.

335
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:20,488
Aw. You know what?
You can have mine.

336
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:21,906
- Me too.
- Me too.

337
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,409
Me too. Ha, ha.

338
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:32,000
Well, I guess if everybody else is.

339
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,429
Hey, guys. So I just called
the Powerball hot line.

340
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:49,892
- Can you believe it? Nobody won.
- Um, I beg to differ.

341
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:55,023
Maybe nobody won the jackpot,
but there was this guy in here earlier...

342
00:21:55,189 --> 00:22:00,111
...and he found a ticket on the street
right outside and won $10,000.

343
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:14,751
Coo. Again, don't blame the pretty lady.

344
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:20,089
It was not her fault.
It was me, the pigeon. Coo.

345
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:26,929
Seriously, stop staring at her.
