1
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:06,755
Why is everybody using
these tiny, little lights nowadays?

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,049
I remember when people used big ones.

3
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,760
That's a good story, Grandpa.

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,347
- Hey.
- Hey.

5
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:19,601
Wow. Monica's letting other people
help decorate her tree?

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,062
Did someone get her
drunk again, or?

7
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:26,859
Having a perfect tree is
not what Christmas is about.

8
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,986
It's about being with loved ones.

9
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,697
That is nice. And we're done.
Ta-da!

10
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,036
It just doesn't quite
feel like Christmas to me.

11
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,621
Oh, here.

12
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,668
See, now it feels like Christmas.

13
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,962
And that's the story of the dreidel.

14
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:35,010
Some people trace the Christmas tree
back to the Egyptians...

15
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,932
...who'd bring palm branches into huts
on the shortest day of the year...

16
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,726
...symbolizing life's
triumph over death.

17
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,896
And that was, like, 4000 years ago.

18
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:49,775
So around the same time
that you started telling this story.

19
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,364
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey. What's up?

20
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:59,868
I had to get out of the apartment.
Janine's stretching all over the place.

21
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,121
Everywhere I look she's like...

22
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,002
I can see why that's hard to resist.

23
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,463
I like her so much.

24
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,507
I'm sorry she doesn't feel the same.

25
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,467
I know. And she's so sweet.

26
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:19,429
I just want to feed her grapes
and brush her hair.

27
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:23,058
You are aware that she's
not a monkey, right?

28
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,689
I am so over Janine.

29
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:34,403
Yeah, at first I thought she was hot,
but now she's like old news.

30
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,364
- Hey, guys.
- Janine!

31
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,995
I'm gonna be a dancer on a TV special
for New Year's Eve.

32
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:47,166
It's called some sort of
Dickin' Rockin' Dicky Eve.

33
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,545
Hold it.

34
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:55,507
Are you talking about
Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve?

35
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,593
Yeah, that's what I said.

36
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,015
Oh, my God, we love that show!

37
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,268
Ross and I have been watching it
since I can remember.

38
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,897
You're still just a little
fat girl inside, aren't you?

39
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,651
I'm gonna be one of the party people.

40
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:19,698
You're gonna be a party person?
Those guys rock the most!

41
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:23,493
They said to bring someone.
Want to be my dance partner?

42
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,455
I would love to spend
New Year's with you.

43
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,458
They're taping tomorrow.
I don't understand why...

44
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,168
Well, how it works is...

45
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:35,172
...the part with Dick Clark
in Times Square is actually live.

46
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,467
But they tape some of the party stuff
ahead of time.

47
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,053
Not a lot of people know that.

48
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,139
Do you guys want to come too?

49
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,060
- Are you serious?
- We are there!

50
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,232
What are you laughing at?

51
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:57,402
Well, I used to date him,
but you're still going out with her.

52
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,866
Thanks.
Great, so we can all go together.

53
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,077
I gotta run. I'll catch you later.

54
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,663
Bye, Janine.

55
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,625
Did she just ask me out on a date?

56
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,544
I don't think so.

57
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:18,173
She invited him to the biggest
party of the millennium.

58
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,926
Yeah, but she also invited
you and Ross.

59
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:24,388
I'm sorry, I don't think that
that was a romantic thing.

60
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,516
Well, maybe.
But, hey, I know how I can find out.

61
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,476
It's a New Year's Eve party.

62
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:34,147
So at midnight, I can kiss her.
And if she kisses me back, great.

63
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,192
If she says, "What are you doing?"

64
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,195
I can say, "It wasn't me,
it was New Year's."

65
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,908
That's better than Ross
kissing me in high school...

66
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:48,745
...and saying that he did it
because he needed Chap Stick.

67
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,874
It was a dry day.

68
00:04:56,254 --> 00:05:00,632
We are going to Dick Clark's
New Year's Rockin' Eve!

69
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:07,222
Oh, my God!

70
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,606
Okay, I've been on sets before...

71
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,567
...so let me give you some advice.

72
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:22,154
It's a show, but we're just dancing.
It's no big deal.

73
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,449
Important thing to remember:
Stay cool.

74
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,326
- Got it.
- Okay.

75
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,662
Oh, my God!
It's just like I dreamed it!

76
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,290
Everyone! Gather up!

77
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,293
- Excuse us!
- Excuse us!

78
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,088
The music's gonna start,
you're gonna dance...

79
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,425
...we'll tape it. Don't look
at the camera. Questions?

80
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:47,346
Uh, yeah, I have a question.
Uh, when is this gonna air?

81
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,350
Yeah. Now, uh, you guys dance
over there...

82
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,353
...you guys, over there.
I want you two here.

83
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,521
- And everyone else, spread out.
- Ross.

84
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,484
So when is it gonna air?

85
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,991
You look in the kitchen,
I got the closet.

86
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,536
I can save you time, ladies.
I'm right here.

87
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:16,541
Yeah. Why don't you take a walk?
This doesn't concern you.

88
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,087
We're looking for our presents
from Monica.

89
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,588
That's terrible.

90
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,465
No, we do it every year.

91
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,134
Oh, well, that makes it not terrible.

92
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,179
Yeah, we never find them.

93
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,266
She's always bested us,
that wily... minx.

94
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,144
We'll search here for an hour...

95
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,064
...and then we'll go to Joey's
and search, okay?

96
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,651
- You can't look for Monica's presents.
- We have to.

97
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,988
You don't have to. And you can't,
because I live here too.

98
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,826
Well, then you should look with us.

99
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,411
Why?

100
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,372
Aren't you worried about
what to get Monica?

101
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,833
No, I have a great idea
for her present.

102
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,044
Oh, that's it?
A great idea? Oh, yeah?

103
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,840
What if she gets you
a great present...

104
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,217
...two mediums
and lots of little ones...

105
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,595
...and you just get her one present?
She'll feel bad.

106
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,390
Why would you do that to her?
Why? Why?

107
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,519
- If I help, we can find them faster!
- Right!

108
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,189
Ooh! Ooh! We have a live one!

109
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,109
- Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
- Yeah.

110
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,654
- Aw!
- Ooh! Who's it for?

111
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:33,535
"Dear Losers, do you really think
I'd hide presents under the couch?

112
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,581
P.S. Chandler,
I knew they'd break you."

113
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,503
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.

114
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,382
We are so gonna find them this year.

115
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,428
You said you'd go across the hall
and look. Do you do that every year?

116
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,721
Yeah.

117
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,640
You don't go into the back
of my closet...

118
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,268
...and look under my gym bag
or anything?

119
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,480
- No. Never do that.
- No.

120
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,736
That's where Joey gave me stuff
to store that I've never seen.

121
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,491
Okay, that did not just happen.

122
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,708
Here comes a camera.

123
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,003
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.

124
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,723
- Why do they keep doing that?
- Ugh!

125
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,809
We have to get up on one
of those platforms.

126
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,770
They've been taping them all day.

127
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,146
Right.

128
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,362
What'd you guys do
to get up on there?

129
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,155
We learned how to dance.

130
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,118
When you learned to dance, did you
forget how to put on underpants?

131
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,328
Yeah!

132
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,585
- Hey, you're a good dancer.
- Really?

133
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,004
You'd be better if you
loosened your hips.

134
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,882
- What do you mean?
- Like this.

135
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:16,471
That's it. Feel the rhythm.
That's better.

136
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,973
Uh-huh.

137
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,892
You're dancing with her.

138
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,645
- We're together.
- Yeah, we came together.

139
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,897
I don't see it.

140
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,277
You are dancing with the tall guy.
Tall Guy, raise your hand!

141
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:36,032
Hey, buddy. Let me dance with her.
I like her and I think I have a shot.

142
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,410
Really, you think so? I don't.

143
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,388
I couldn't find anything...
Hey, wait!

144
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,764
Yeah, we found them.

145
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,058
They were in the guest room closet.

146
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,395
You have nothing to worry about
because they're crap.

147
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,275
Those are mine.
I got those for you.

148
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,947
Oh. Thanks, Chandler, they're great!

149
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,453
Chandler, what is this very weird, um,
metal A-Z thing?

150
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,873
Those are bookends.
That's a great gift.

151
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,293
Oh. Okay, I'm sorry.
Thank you for my "az."

152
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,965
Make sure you put all that stuff
back in the closet.

153
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,467
Yes, okay.

154
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:40,221
By the way, I think it's really nice
of you that even after you moved...

155
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,224
...you still keep storing
that stuff for Joey.

156
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,825
Hey, dancing girl?

157
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,371
Can I go to the bathroom?

158
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,541
Here we go. Yeah.

159
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,256
Looking good, Gellers!

160
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,926
We know!

161
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,264
That snippy guy's the one who
decides who gets on the platform.

162
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,225
- We should go dance by him.
- Okay.

163
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,235
Okay, everybody, hold!

164
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,823
Next on the platforms are...

165
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,579
- You two! And...
- Yes!

166
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,500
- You two!
- Cool!

167
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,335
Excuse me? Sir?

168
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,255
Would it help if I weren't
wearing underpants?

169
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,215
Would it?

170
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,142
Hey, Tall Guy!

171
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,521
I want to talk to you about that girl
you're dancing with.

172
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,483
She's nice, huh? To think I almost
brought my wife to this.

173
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:19,154
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

174
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,284
Look, I came with that girl, okay?

175
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,203
I plan to kiss her
at the New Year's countdown.

176
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,164
I'm trying to win her over. I...

177
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,915
I don't think so.

178
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,001
You can dance with my partner.

179
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,295
She's real mellow.

180
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,133
Look, you dating this girl
you came with?

181
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,844
I was hoping after tonight
that maybe...

182
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,347
No. No. She's fair game
if you ask me. Sorry, buddy.

183
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,016
All right. Hey.

184
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:52,604
Fair is fair. When you're right,
you're right. What can I say?

185
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,689
Hey! Oh, no.

186
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,568
Are you in second grade?

187
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,571
Hey, man. You're the one
who wet his pants.

188
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,448
Hey!

189
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,830
Man, this sucks.

190
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,334
If Mom and Dad don't see us
on TV after we made them jealous...

191
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,795
...then who's gonna be
the losers then?

192
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:22,383
- I know what'll get us up on a platform.
- What?

193
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,677
The routine!

194
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,098
We haven't done the routine
since middle school.

195
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,726
When the snippy guy
sees the routine...

196
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,437
...he'll want to build us
our own platform.

197
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:35,939
Was it that good?

198
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,276
We got honorable mention in the
brother-sister dance category!

199
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:44,030
It's almost fake midnight.
Do we really have any other choice?

200
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,450
Okay, let's do it.

201
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,995
Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!

202
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,587
Five, six, seven, eight!

203
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:45,925
So do we really need to ask who's
going up on the platform next?

204
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,137
You get up there and do that
again, exactly like that.

205
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,847
- Yeah!
- Ooh!

206
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:56,060
Get this. Dick will want
it for the Bloopers show.

207
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,814
All right, cut!
Listen up, everyone!

208
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,191
When we start,
it'll be the countdown...

209
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,445
...so I want to see
everybody's excitement!

210
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,030
Hey, guy!

211
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,282
You got three seconds to get away.

212
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,867
What's going on here?

213
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,244
Take a look at the guy's pants!

214
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:18,041
You told us to show excitement,
but don't you think he went overboard?

215
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,294
What's the matter with you? Go!

216
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,546
Yeah, take a hike, wet pants!

217
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,467
Can you believe this?

218
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,719
We're on the platform
for the millennial moment!

219
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:30,929
I know!

220
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,557
You haven't been practicing
the routine, have you?

221
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,517
No.

222
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,228
Me too!

223
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,564
When the music starts...

224
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,859
...I was thinking about maybe
going into the robot.

225
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:51,783
Ross? We should stick to the routine.
We don't want to look stupid.

226
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,496
All right, we're back!
Ten seconds left.

227
00:15:56,747 --> 00:16:00,875
- Ten.
- Nine, eight, seven.

228
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,461
Okay, it all comes down to this.

229
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,756
Whatever happens, happens.

230
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,050
Destiny.

231
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,303
Three, two, one!

232
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,305
- Cut!
- No!

233
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,267
- Year!

234
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,145
Happy No Year!

235
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,359
Now we go to the live shot
of Times Square. That's a wrap!

236
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,540
Hey, look who I found.

237
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,208
Oh, hi, guys!

238
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,336
Birds have a very good
sense of direction.

239
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,464
I thought maybe they could help us
find the presents.

240
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,052
Yes, if the presents are hidden
south for the winter.

241
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,724
Or we could just follow your clever
jokes. Any ideas? Didn't think so.

242
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,978
Come on, show us where
the presents are.

243
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,189
The duck seems to think that
Monica got me garbage.

244
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:09,235
I wonder what I could get Monica
that's as good as garbage.

245
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,696
Hmm. How about my "az"?

246
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:20,079
- Hey. This is hollow.
- What?

247
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,125
This bench, it's hollow.
I can't believe I never knew that!

248
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,047
- Oh, the presents!
- Don't look directly at them!

249
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,091
What?

250
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,761
All right, no, we could look at them.

251
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,429
This one's for me!

252
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,931
This one's for Chandler. Here.

253
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,685
- And the big one's for me!
- Oh, let's open them!

254
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,065
- Wait a minute. We can't do this.
- Why?

255
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,610
I don't want to know
what Monica got me.

256
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,572
I'm sure she worked hard at getting it
and wanting to surprise me.

257
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,783
And you guys are gonna ruin that.

258
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,369
We have to put them back.
This isn't what Christmas is about.

259
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,831
Whatever, Linus.
I'm opening mine.

260
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,004
Nobody is opening anything, okay?

261
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:14,008
I want to see the look on her face
when I give her my present.

262
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,762
I'm sure she wants to see the look
on my face when I get mine.

263
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,808
So, please, please, can we just?
Can we put them back?

264
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,228
- Will you get us better gifts?
- Fine.

265
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,981
Hey, guys.

266
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,693
You found the presents?

267
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,113
You let them find the presents?

268
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,322
Great.

269
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,451
Do you know how long it took me
to find you that water purifier?

270
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,997
- That's what you got me?
- Yes, I see. That look is priceless.

271
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,798
Home sweet home, huh?

272
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,677
Nice to, uh, get back to reality.

273
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,974
Plus, we, uh, know how the New Year's
gonna go off.

274
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,769
I guess there's no reason for all
that Y2K panic, you know?

275
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,481
Anyway, good night.

276
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,984
- Joey?
- Yeah?

277
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,946
Three...

278
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,448
...two, one.

279
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,374
Happy New Year.

280
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,755
What was that for?

281
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,426
Tonight when they yelled "cut"
and we didn't get to kiss...

282
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:42,597
...I was really, really disappointed,
and I just...

283
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,099
I just really wanted to kiss you.

284
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,976
Really?

285
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:52,440
In the moment, I really wanted
to kiss you too. In the moment.

286
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,359
- In the moment.
- But only in the moment.

287
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:01,616
So do you, uh, want to kiss again?

288
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,536
Sure. New Year's Eve
is only two weeks away.

289
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:06,996
Can you wait?

290
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,873
No.

291
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,959
Me neither.

292
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,924
Three, two...

293
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,468
You don't have to count down
every time we kiss.

294
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,637
Oh. Okay.

295
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,684
Except I sort of felt like I needed
a couple seconds to get ready.

296
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,920
We were on the platform, ready to
dance into the new millennium...

297
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,839
...and the guy yells "cut!"

298
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,843
So you guys are telling me
that you actually did...

299
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,513
...the routine from eighth grade?

300
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:09,600
Yeah! But of course we had
to update it a little bit.

301
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,812
Hey, by the way, quick thinking
about catching me.

302
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,691
There's no way you could've
done the end...

303
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,318
...the way you guys did it back then.

304
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,781
What? We could do it.

305
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:28,995
I don't know. You were a lot bigger...
I mean, stronger back then.

306
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,540
I can do it, okay?

307
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,334
Come on, let's go! Come on.

308
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,296
One, two, three, four...

309
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,090
...five, six, seven, eight.

310
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,508
- I can't do it!
- Ahh!

311
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:48,472
Now, you do that, you're on TV.
