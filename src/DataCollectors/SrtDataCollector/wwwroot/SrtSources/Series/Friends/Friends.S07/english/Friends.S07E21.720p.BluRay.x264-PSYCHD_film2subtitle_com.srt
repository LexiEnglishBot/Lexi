1
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:07,423
Do you realize we're
getting married in four weeks?

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,676
Four weeks, baby. Four weeks!

3
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,595
You realize you get louder each week?

4
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:18,142
There's still so much to do!
Have you written your vows?

5
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:22,896
I figured I'd just buy those.
"Pat, I'd like to buy a vow." Ha, ha.

6
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:27,026
You know I've no sense of humor
when it comes to this.

7
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:33,323
- Right. Have you written yours yet?
- No, but I know what I'm gonna say.

8
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:36,702
Do you happen to know
what I'm gonna say?

9
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,665
Let's do it now. It won't be hard.

10
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,876
Say what's in your heart.

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,303
Look at her go.
She must love me more than I love her!

12
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:59,099
What's wrong with me?
Ooh, don't open that door.

13
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:45,312
Phew. "Monica, there are no words..."

14
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,276
There are no words!
This shouldn't be this hard!

15
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:56,365
Uh... Oh! You've done this before.
What did you say in your vows?

16
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:00,869
With Carol I promised never
to love another woman until I die.

17
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,996
She made no such promise.

18
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:08,460
I'm pathetic. Monica knows what
to say, you should have seen her.

19
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,965
What's the emergency?

20
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:17,177
You have to help me write my vows.
All I have is this.

21
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:21,306
I like the pretty drawing
of you in the wedding dress.

22
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:26,353
- Thank you.
- Except your breasts look small.

23
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,523
Those are my eyes!

24
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:35,070
- Those are my breasts.
- Oh, yeah.

25
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,658
Why don't you start
with something simple?

26
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,118
Like, um:

27
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:46,540
"Monica, from the moment I met you
I knew I loved you."

28
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,500
I can't do that.

29
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,211
Everyone, this is Chandler.

30
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,505
Hi, I'm Ross' little sister.

31
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,133
Okay.

32
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:01,513
Okay, okay.
Um, maybe you could start with:

33
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,391
"Chandler, even though
we were friends...

34
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:08,145
...there was a part of me
that knew I wanted more."

35
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:13,108
All right, there's a nuclear
holocaust. I'm the last man on Earth.

36
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,651
Would you go out with me?

37
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,868
Ooh! Are we allowed
to lie in the vows?

38
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:28,749
Okay, don't talk about those feelings.
Just say something about...

39
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,877
...all the things
he's taught you, like...

40
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,344
Or all the things you taught him.

41
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:45,265
Everybody knows the erogenous zones.
One, two, three...

42
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:50,687
...four, five, six and seven.

43
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,689
There are seven?

44
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,946
- That's one?
- Heh, heh. Kind of an important one.

45
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,032
I was looking at it upside down.

46
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,496
Ha. You know, sometimes that helps.

47
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:15,254
Okay, start out with a little one...

48
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,298
...a two, a one-two-three...

49
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,719
...a three, a five...

50
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,431
...a four, a three-two...

51
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,809
...two, a two-four-six.

52
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:33,480
Two-four-six, four, two...

53
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,316
...two, four-seven...

54
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,028
...five-seven, six-seven...

55
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,781
...seven, seven...

56
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:46,326
...seven, seven, seven...

57
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,953
...seven!

58
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:49,997
Seven.

59
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,755
Oh! I got it.
How about something like:

60
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:03,885
"Monica, when I look back
over our time together..."

61
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,517
- Yeah?
- I can't do all of it.

62
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,477
Look back over your time together.

63
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,524
Oh, look, twins!

64
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:21,737
No fair! I don't even have one,
how come they get two?

65
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,656
- You'll get one.
- Yeah, when?

66
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,283
All right, I'll tell you what.

67
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,869
When we're 40,
if neither of us are married...

68
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,874
...what do you say we have one?
- Why wouldn't I be married?

69
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,210
Oh, no, no, no.
I just meant hypothetically.

70
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:40,464
Hypothetically,
why won't I be married?

71
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,757
No, no.

72
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:45,552
What is it? Is there
something unmarriable about me?

73
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,889
- Uh... Uh...
- Well?

74
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,392
Dear God, this parachute
is a knapsack!

75
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,146
I'm getting married today!

76
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,360
Think he knew I was here?

77
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,993
Nice try.

78
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,995
Wait, wait, wait.

79
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,166
- Look, Monica...
- Ah!

80
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,091
- This is not gonna work.
- I bet this'll work.

81
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,143
You are so great! I love you.

82
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,279
What?

83
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:50,283
I said you're so great,
and then I stopped talking.

84
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,580
- You said you love me!
- No, I didn't.

85
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,835
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't!

86
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,463
- You love me!
- No, I don't!

87
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,424
Stop it! Stop it!

88
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:13,723
You know, I was thinking,
what if I, uh, unpack here?

89
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,684
Then all your stuff would be here.

90
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,354
Well...

91
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,733
What if it was here?

92
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,487
Then you'd be going back
and forth all the time.

93
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,573
Doesn't make any sense.

94
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,658
Okay.

95
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,164
What if we live together,
and you understand what I'm saying?

96
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,717
We wanted to surprise you.

97
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,687
Oh, my God!

98
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,778
Chandler...

99
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,907
...in all my life...

100
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,452
...I never thought I'd be so lucky...

101
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:22,584
...as to fall in love with my best...

102
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:28,131
My best... There's a reason
why girls don't do this!

103
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,425
Okay, okay, okay! I'll do it.

104
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,386
I thought...

105
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,184
I can do this.

106
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,648
I thought...

107
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:50,070
...that it mattered what I said
or where I said it.

108
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:55,909
Then I realized the only thing
that matters is that you...

109
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:04,251
You make me happier
than I ever thought I could be.

110
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,548
And if you let me...

111
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:14,052
...I'll spend the rest of my life
trying to make you feel the same way.

112
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,604
Monica?

113
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,066
Will you marry me?

114
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,987
Yes.

115
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,586
Can we come in?
We're dying out here!

116
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,338
Come in! Come in!

117
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,258
- We're engaged!
- Yes!

118
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,438
- Hey.
- Hey.

119
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,189
- Hi.
- What have you guys been up to?

120
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,735
Uh, helping Chandler write his vows.
He kicked us out.

121
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,696
Joey kept making
inappropriate suggestions.

122
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,577
How is "Monica, I love
your sweet ass" inappropriate?

123
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,080
How's Monica doing?

124
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:28,168
Lucky she's got a sweet ass.
She's not so good at writing.

125
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,380
In four weeks
they're gonna be married!

126
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,758
Let's just hope it works.

127
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,177
Nine out of 10 marriages
end in divorce.

128
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,596
Heh. That's not true.

129
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,848
You're right. How's the missus?

130
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,768
I can't believe...

131
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,437
...they're together 3 years.
- That long?

132
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:51,066
It seems like less
because they hid it from us.

133
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,778
Hey, it's me. Coming in.

134
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,953
I've had a very long, hard day.

135
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:08,208
- Uh, I'm getting chicken. Want some?
- Uh, no. Bye, then.

136
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,297
Are you okay?
I'm so sorry.

137
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,676
He wouldn't leave.
He kept asking if I wanted chicken.

138
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,219
Chicken?

139
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,097
I could eat some chicken.

140
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,016
Hey, Joe!

141
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:31,147
Can I get a, uh, three-piece,
uh, coleslaw, beans and a Coke?

142
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,983
Diet Coke.

143
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:42,325
- Why didn't they tell us?
- I know, we were cool about it.

144
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,453
You? And you?

145
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,748
You cannot tell. No one knows.

146
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,792
How? When?

147
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,586
- It happened in London.
- In London?

148
00:11:56,507 --> 00:12:00,135
We didn't want to make
a big deal out of it.

149
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,554
But it is a big deal!

150
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,473
- I have to tell someone.
- No, no!

151
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,976
- You can't.
- Please!

152
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:12,564
We don't want to deal with telling
them. Just promise you won't tell.

153
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,485
All right!

154
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,196
I can't wait to be with you.

155
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,490
I'll tell Rachel I'm doing laundry.

156
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,702
Laundry, huh? Is that my new nickname?

157
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,497
Aw.

158
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,208
You know your nickname, Mr. Big...

159
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:39,716
Oh, look, there's Monica and Chandler.
Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!

160
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,604
Chandler and Monica!

161
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,272
Oh, my God!

162
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,400
- Aah! Chandler and Monica!
- Oh, my God!

163
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:01,279
- Oh, my eyes! My eyes!
- Phoebe! Phoebe!

164
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:05,158
- It's okay! It's okay!
- No! They're doing it!

165
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,576
I know! I know!

166
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,077
- You know?
- Yes!

167
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,456
And Joey, but Ross doesn't,
so stop screaming!

168
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,082
Hey, what's going on?

169
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,462
What? What?

170
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,715
We're excited that you
might get this place!

171
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,636
- Actually, it looks really good.
- It looks pretty good!

172
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,430
Get in here! Come on!

173
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,895
So they don't know
that Rachel knows?

174
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:38,066
Yes, but it doesn't matter
who knows what.

175
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,528
Enough of us know.
We can just tell them we know.

176
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,697
The lying and the secrets
will be over.

177
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:49,536
Or, we can not tell them we know
and have a little fun of our own.

178
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,414
We better go if we're gonna
catch that movie.

179
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,375
- Bye.
- Bye.

180
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,253
Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.

181
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,427
Did you see
the inappropriate pinching?

182
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,762
Actually, I did.

183
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,391
So now do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

184
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,603
Oh, my God!
My God, she knows about us!

185
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:19,232
- Phoebe knows about us!
- I didn't tell them.

186
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,318
Them? Who's them?

187
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:26,114
Uh, Phoebe and Joey.

188
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,200
Joey!

189
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,827
And Rachel.

190
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,038
They made me promise not to tell.

191
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,667
They think they are so slick,
messing with us!

192
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,004
They don't know that we know
that they know.

193
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,340
- So...
- Ah, yes!

194
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,468
The messers become the messees!

195
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,056
My God, he wants me to come
over and feel his biceps!

196
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,309
- Are you kidding?
- No.

197
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:57,061
I can't believe he'd do that to Mo...

198
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,573
Joey? Do they know that we know?

199
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,284
- No.
- Joey!

200
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,162
- They know you know.
- Ugh! I knew it!

201
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,248
I cannot believe those two!

202
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,209
They thought that they could
mess with us? With us?

203
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:27,008
They don't know that we know
they know we know.

204
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,261
Joey, you can't say anything.

205
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,388
Couldn't if I wanted to.

206
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,100
This is totally getting out of hand.

207
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,978
- She wants me to put lotion on her!
- She's bluffing!

208
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,106
She's not backing down.
She went like this.

209
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,403
He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.

210
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,283
Oh, man.
Aren't you guys done yet?

211
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:57,080
The sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler
the sooner this is all over.

212
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,207
- Ooh, I like that.
- Okay.

213
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:04,295
Okay, show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.

214
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,222
Wow! You didn't rip off
any buttons.

215
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,057
It's not my first time.

216
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,937
You go seduce her until she cracks.

217
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,981
Okay, give me a second.

218
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,734
- Did you clean up in here?
- Of course.

219
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,866
Oh, you're, uh, going?

220
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,327
Um, not without you, lover.

221
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,544
So, this is my bra.

222
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,299
It's very, very nice.

223
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,013
Well, come here.

224
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,890
I'm happy we're gonna
have all the sex.

225
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,895
You should be. Heh. I'm very bendy.

226
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,070
- I'm gonna kiss you.
- Not if I kiss you first.

227
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:34,260
There's nothing left
for us to do but kiss.

228
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,013
Here it comes.

229
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,599
Our first kiss.

230
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:52,028
- Okay, okay, okay, fine, you win!
- Ha!

231
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,030
- I can't have sex.
- Why not?

232
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,991
- I'm in love with Monica.
- You're what?

233
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:04,540
Love her! That's right, I love her!
I love her!

234
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,005
I love you, Monica.

235
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,133
I love you too, Chandler.

236
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,433
I thought you guys were doing it,
I didn't know you were in love.

237
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,647
That's it, it's over.
Everybody knows.

238
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:31,901
- Well, Ross doesn't.
- We'd like it if no one told him yet.

239
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,528
No.

240
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,116
What are you doing?

241
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:42,787
Get off my sister!

242
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:47,333
Friends getting married,
it's gotta change things.

243
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,210
Think it'll be different?

244
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,505
How can it not be?
They're gonna have kids...

245
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:56,092
...and hang out with other couples
who have kids.

246
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,845
And maybe they'll leave the city...

247
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,889
...to be near a Volvo dealership.

248
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,352
Things change.

249
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,814
I don't want them
to move to a Volvo dealership.

250
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,442
It'll be okay, Joe. Heh.

251
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:17,155
Sorry. I just...
I like things the way they are.

252
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,866
Who's this little naked guy?

253
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,160
Uh, that naked guy would be me.

254
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,454
- Ha, aw, look at the little thing.
- Ha-ha-ha.

255
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,123
Yes.

256
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:32,712
Yes, fine, that is my penis.
Can we be grownups now?

257
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,799
- Who are those people?
- Got me.

258
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,093
Oh, that's Nana right there.

259
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,929
- Wow.
- Let's see.

260
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,807
"Me and the gang at Java Joe's."

261
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,561
Wow. Monica, you look like
your grandma. How old was she?

262
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,688
Let's see, 1939.

263
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,982
Yeah, uh, 24, 25.

264
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,110
Huh. Looks like a fun gang.

265
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,785
Ooh! Look, look, look!
I got Monica naked.

266
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:05,995
Let me see.

267
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,917
No, that would be me again.

268
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,506
Hey, you guys.

269
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,716
- Hey.
- Hey.

270
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,969
- What's going on?
- Well, we were just talking about...

271
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,431
...you guys getting married
and how great it is.

272
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,685
Yeah, you can get a Volvo.
If that's what you really want.

273
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,355
- That's so sweet.
- Hmm.

274
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,485
- So, we both finished our vows.
- Can we read them?

275
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,655
As long as I don't hear his
and he doesn't hear mine.

276
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,573
- Okay.
- Okay.

277
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,245
- Aw.
- Oh.

278
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,416
Oh, that's beautiful.

279
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,253
Funny one! Good!

280
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,965
Will you marry me?

281
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,719
- Ha-ha-ha.
- What? I don't get it.

282
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,179
Oh, yeah!

283
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,060
- Man, this is hilarious!
- Chandler!

284
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,939
Don't worry, we'll make yours funnier.

285
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,782
Okay, what do you think?

286
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:31,789
- Dude...
- I have never known love like this.

287
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,084
- You really like it?
- Dude!

288
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,296
How did you write this?

289
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,090
I stole Monica's
and changed the name. Shh.

290
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,095
- You can't do that!
- If he goes first he can!
