1
00:00:03,715 --> 00:00:06,582
-Good! You guys are all here.
-What's up?

2
00:00:06,852 --> 00:00:09,844
l have a job interview
at Ralph Lauren tomorrow.

3
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:11,879
Congratulations!

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,923
Oh, boy.
That guy's underwear sucks!

5
00:00:15,527 --> 00:00:18,519
-What?
-Well, l got this pair marked ''XS.''

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,561
Let me tell you, there was no room
for excess anything in there.

7
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:25,560
l'll be the coordinator
of the women's collection.

8
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:30,037
l'll work right under the director.
lt's the perfect job for me!

9
00:00:30,242 --> 00:00:32,506
lf you nail the interview,
you'll get it.

10
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:35,178
You want to work
on your interview skills?

11
00:00:36,214 --> 00:00:38,273
Let's start with the handshake.

12
00:00:40,786 --> 00:00:43,550
Very good handshake.
Good wrist action.

13
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:45,588
Let me try.

14
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:49,557
Oh, my God!
What did l ever do to you?

15
00:00:49,795 --> 00:00:51,126
Did l squeeze too hard?

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,761
Let's just say
l'm glad l'm not Chandler.

17
00:00:58,103 --> 00:01:00,264
The One with Rachel's lnadvertent Kiss

18
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,683
That's right, Ross.
l can see you in your new apartment.

19
00:01:48,954 --> 00:01:52,412
Same as yesterday,
same as the day before.

20
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:54,653
ls he doing
his ''shark attack'' bit?

21
00:01:54,926 --> 00:01:57,588
No. Oh, wait!
There he goes.

22
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,507
Very funny, Ross.

23
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:16,612
Very lifelike and funny.

24
00:02:19,518 --> 00:02:22,043
No, no.
l wasn't waving at you, lady.

25
00:02:24,122 --> 00:02:26,454
Whoa, maybe l was.

26
00:02:27,025 --> 00:02:30,324
This hot girl in Ross' building
is flirting with me.

27
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:33,794
Get in there, man.
Flirt back. Mix it up!

28
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:36,558
Yeah, l'm down with that.

29
00:02:38,737 --> 00:02:40,364
Okay, here goes.

30
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:43,206
How...

31
00:02:43,575 --> 00:02:45,008
...you...

32
00:02:45,677 --> 00:02:47,474
...doing?

33
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:53,317
lt worked! She's waving me over.
l'll be right over.

34
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:55,815
Let's see,
she's on the third floor....

35
00:02:57,556 --> 00:03:00,821
-She is pretty, huh?
-Tell me about it.

36
00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:04,062
No, no! l'm not with her.

37
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:06,025
That's just Monica.

38
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:26,477
Hey, Joey!

39
00:03:26,752 --> 00:03:28,982
Great stuff, huh?

40
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:30,915
This your place?

41
00:03:31,156 --> 00:03:33,522
Yeah, of course it is.
Come on in.

42
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:37,092
Go by the window.
You can pretend to be surfing.

43
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:41,756
l counted.
You're not supposed to live here!

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,331
Oh, man!

45
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:50,130
What happened?

46
00:03:50,308 --> 00:03:54,074
l ended up at Ross' place.
l must have miscounted or something.

47
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:57,510
Damn! She's not there anymore.

48
00:03:57,749 --> 00:04:01,048
Look, Ross is doing
his ''watching TV'' bit.

49
00:04:03,955 --> 00:04:06,515
No, Joe, l think
he's just watching TV.

50
00:04:17,068 --> 00:04:19,696
<i>We've lost visual contact</i>
<i>with the suspect.</i>

51
00:04:19,905 --> 00:04:22,430
Okay, now l really have to go.

52
00:04:22,774 --> 00:04:25,607
lt's so unfair that
our date has to get cut short...

53
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:28,609
...just because some guy
shot at a store clerk.

54
00:04:29,414 --> 00:04:32,781
-l know, but it's my job.
-Then maybe l could come too.

55
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:36,885
<i>Suspect has just emerged</i>
<i>naked from the sewer.</i>

56
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:38,748
All right, you go.

57
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,926
-Oh, God!
-What?

58
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:52,126
Oh, l just miss him so much!

59
00:04:56,842 --> 00:04:58,742
For just a week,
you guys are close.

60
00:04:58,977 --> 00:05:02,174
Yeah, it's weird.
l can't help it. He's so sweet.

61
00:05:02,414 --> 00:05:05,008
He's like this little
puppy dog, you know?

62
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,084
But like a really tough one
who shoots bad guys.

63
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:12,984
l love the beginning parts
of relationships.

64
00:05:13,191 --> 00:05:15,386
You can't keep your hands
off each other.

65
00:05:15,594 --> 00:05:17,789
l know. lt is the best.

66
00:05:18,864 --> 00:05:21,424
How long did that last
for you and Chandler?

67
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,931
What? lt's still going on.

68
00:05:25,604 --> 00:05:28,004
Come on, seriously.
When did it end?

69
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,536
l am serious. We're all over
each other all the time.

70
00:05:32,777 --> 00:05:36,213
Okay, you know where you are
better than l do.

71
00:05:36,448 --> 00:05:38,609
Why don't you just calm down?

72
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:44,815
Get all your facts before you tell
everybody you're the only hot couple.

73
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,724
God, l woke the beast.

74
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:52,688
l was wrong, obviously.
l just misspoke. lt's okay.

75
00:05:52,898 --> 00:05:54,297
lt is okay.

76
00:05:54,499 --> 00:05:57,866
As long as you know Chandler and l
are also hot and fiery.

77
00:05:58,069 --> 00:05:59,366
Just as hot as you.

78
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:00,799
l mean, our flame....

79
00:06:01,072 --> 00:06:03,336
lt is on fire!

80
00:06:05,176 --> 00:06:06,666
Here's your broom back.

81
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,743
You are so cute!

82
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:20,087
The cute bar keeps getting lower
and lower, doesn't it?

83
00:06:25,363 --> 00:06:26,660
How'd the interview go?

84
00:06:26,865 --> 00:06:30,801
Horrible! l did the stupidest,
most embarrassing thing.

85
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:34,938
Did you say you wanted to have sex
with his wife then fall off your chair?

86
00:06:38,176 --> 00:06:40,576
Did you get drunk on the way over there?

87
00:06:41,713 --> 00:06:45,012
Well, that explains why you didn't do
the other stuff.

88
00:06:45,483 --> 00:06:46,745
So, what happened?

89
00:06:46,952 --> 00:06:50,115
lt was horrible!
And the interview part went so well.

90
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:51,789
l even made him laugh.

91
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,254
He said something about a boat...

92
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:59,192
...and l was like, ''Well, yeah,
if you've got enough life jackets.''

93
00:07:02,634 --> 00:07:05,831
Trust me.
lt was actually very funny.

94
00:07:06,037 --> 00:07:09,438
Anyway, we were
saying goodbye and....

95
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:10,697
What happened?

96
00:07:10,976 --> 00:07:12,637
We were shaking hands...

97
00:07:12,844 --> 00:07:14,869
<i>...and he leaned in toward me.</i>

98
00:07:15,113 --> 00:07:17,104
<i>Maybe he was opening the door...</i>

99
00:07:17,315 --> 00:07:20,682
<i>...but I totally</i>
<i>misread him and I....</i>

100
00:07:27,859 --> 00:07:29,690
You kissed him?

101
00:07:29,894 --> 00:07:32,055
l didn't know what else to do!

102
00:07:32,697 --> 00:07:34,289
You could have tried...

103
00:07:34,532 --> 00:07:36,124
...not kissing him.

104
00:07:36,835 --> 00:07:37,824
Thanks, Chandler.

105
00:07:38,036 --> 00:07:41,767
A guy from Ralph Lauren called.
You got a second interview.

106
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,999
Monica, that's not funny.

107
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:45,972
Oh, okay.

108
00:07:46,144 --> 00:07:51,047
<i>A guy from Ralph Lauren called</i>
<i>You got a second interview</i>

109
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,446
Oh, my God, Monica,
you better be serious.

110
00:07:56,621 --> 00:07:59,488
You just told me to be funny!

111
00:07:59,657 --> 00:08:02,922
Oh, my God. l can't believe it!
l got a second interview.

112
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:06,154
That kiss isn't looking like
such a mistake now, is it?

113
00:08:06,564 --> 00:08:09,328
You don't think that's
why he wants me back?

114
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:10,795
Yeah!

115
00:08:11,803 --> 00:08:13,065
No?

116
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:15,663
What are you talking about?

117
00:08:16,274 --> 00:08:18,799
l accidentally kissed him
in the interview...

118
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,807
...and now he wants me back...

119
00:08:21,012 --> 00:08:24,948
...because, ''Let's bring back
the girl who kisses everybody!''

120
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:27,675
Come on, Rach.

121
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,355
What if he thinks
l'll just sleep with him?

122
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:33,919
He wants you back because
you're right for the job.

123
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,959
Maybe. l don't know. Oh, God!
How could l be so stupid?

124
00:08:38,163 --> 00:08:42,099
Rachel, don't say that. l think
you just need a hug from Joey.

125
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:44,358
Come on. Come on.

126
00:08:45,503 --> 00:08:47,528
She's back! Hot girl's back!

127
00:08:48,173 --> 00:08:51,836
Well, l'm not totally back yet,
but l appreciate it.

128
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,874
No. ln Ross' building.
She's back!

129
00:08:55,113 --> 00:08:57,206
Wait there.
l'll be over in a second.

130
00:08:57,515 --> 00:08:58,982
One, two, three....
Got it!

131
00:09:03,855 --> 00:09:06,289
l gotta check out this hot girl.

132
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:09,019
There she is!

133
00:09:16,734 --> 00:09:19,294
Damn it! Did you move?

134
00:09:19,671 --> 00:09:21,366
Yes.

135
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:24,870
l lived with you for a while.
Then l found this place.

136
00:09:27,712 --> 00:09:29,577
l'm Ross.

137
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:46,729
Do you happen to have
a hot girl in there?

138
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:50,791
No, l'm all alone.

139
00:09:51,002 --> 00:09:52,902
Yeah. Sorry about that.

140
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:02,070
Hey, little girl.

141
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,774
ls your mommy or sister or babysitter,
by any chance, a hot girl?

142
00:10:07,752 --> 00:10:10,380
-Daddy!
-Later, girl!

143
00:10:15,627 --> 00:10:17,254
Oh, man!

144
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:21,762
Hot girl?

145
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:25,296
Hot girl!

146
00:10:30,308 --> 00:10:32,435
Hi, Rachel. Come on in.

147
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:36,145
-lt's nice to see you again.
-Thank you.

148
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:41,443
What?

149
00:10:43,121 --> 00:10:45,146
-Excuse me?
-Yeah, let me--

150
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:49,223
Okay, l see what's going on here.
Now, look...

151
00:10:49,427 --> 00:10:51,793
...l'm sorry if l gave you
the wrong impression.

152
00:10:51,996 --> 00:10:56,057
But l am not some hussy who will
just sleep around to get ahead.

153
00:10:56,301 --> 00:10:59,828
Even though l kissed you,
that does not give you...

154
00:11:00,071 --> 00:11:04,838
...the right to demand sex from me!
l do not want this job that bad.

155
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:06,940
Good day, sir.

156
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:14,375
lf you're going in there to see Mr. Zelner,
l hope you're ready to put out.

157
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,648
l am.

158
00:11:22,894 --> 00:11:25,055
You are not gonna believe...

159
00:11:25,263 --> 00:11:27,959
...what that sleazeball
from Ralph Lauren did to me!

160
00:11:32,036 --> 00:11:35,301
Okay, that's amazing!
How did you know that?

161
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:37,738
You got ink on your lip.

162
00:11:48,286 --> 00:11:51,187
What do you say, maybe,
sometime l hold your gun?

163
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:53,220
We're not supposed to do that.

164
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:55,956
What could happen? l mean--

165
00:11:57,729 --> 00:11:59,822
Yeah. l'm gonna say no.

166
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:05,828
-Do you want to see a movie tonight?
-We can't. We already have plans.

167
00:12:06,471 --> 00:12:07,768
What are you doing?

168
00:12:07,972 --> 00:12:12,409
Well, same thing we did all day.
Just hang out at Gary's apartment.

169
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,602
He is so amazing.
We never left the bedroom.

170
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:19,746
But have fun at the movie.

171
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:23,679
Well, we're not seeing a movie.

172
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:27,691
Then why did you ask us
if we wanted to go?

173
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:30,927
Because l just wanted
to know what you were doing...

174
00:12:31,162 --> 00:12:34,154
...so you wouldn't walk in
on me and Chandler...

175
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:36,423
...while we were doing it all night.

176
00:12:38,202 --> 00:12:39,863
Will you excuse me?

177
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:47,034
Chandler?
Can l see you for a second?

178
00:12:50,214 --> 00:12:53,012
-We have got to beat them!
-Why?

179
00:12:53,217 --> 00:12:56,778
Because Gary and Phoebe think
they're a hotter couple than us.

180
00:12:57,689 --> 00:12:59,156
So?

181
00:12:59,824 --> 00:13:03,726
So we've gotta go have a lot of sex
and prove them wrong!

182
00:13:04,228 --> 00:13:07,527
You've got to stop this
competitive thing. lt's crazy.

183
00:13:07,732 --> 00:13:11,828
Just to impress them, you want us
to have sex over and over...

184
00:13:12,036 --> 00:13:15,005
...and l'm saying no to this, why?
Get your coat!

185
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:27,711
Excuse me.

186
00:13:32,023 --> 00:13:34,787
You should check this out.
Tell the other tenants.

187
00:13:34,992 --> 00:13:38,189
Apparently, he's looking
for some kind of hot girl.

188
00:13:40,998 --> 00:13:42,056
Who isn't?

189
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,869
l don't think we've met.
l'm Ross.

190
00:13:51,843 --> 00:13:55,244
l know. You're the guy who
wouldn't chip in for the handyman.

191
00:13:57,048 --> 00:13:58,379
Never mind.

192
00:13:59,217 --> 00:14:02,846
l actually thought it was unfair
the way everyone reacted.

193
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:05,022
l mean, you had just moved in.

194
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,722
l had just moved in!

195
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:09,722
Thank you!

196
00:14:10,595 --> 00:14:11,994
Listen....

197
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,229
Jen.

198
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:17,862
l know this may sound a little....

199
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:23,670
But would you want to grab
a cup of coffee sometime?

200
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:26,573
Sure, that would be nice.

201
00:14:28,946 --> 00:14:32,040
My number's on there.
Give me a call.

202
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,774
l will give you a call.

203
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:36,382
-l'll see you later.
-Okay.

204
00:14:41,526 --> 00:14:43,460
l forgot my paper.

205
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:50,761
That was amazing.

206
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:54,933
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna
hear about this at dinner.

207
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:57,431
That was amazing.

208
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:00,939
We are the hottest, huh?

209
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:03,739
No one is hotter than we are.

210
00:15:03,948 --> 00:15:07,076
-We're the best.
-No, you're the best.

211
00:15:07,752 --> 00:15:10,778
-No, you're the best.
-No, you're the best.

212
00:15:11,222 --> 00:15:13,087
l am the best.

213
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,822
Hey, guys.

214
00:15:17,295 --> 00:15:18,660
What you been doing?

215
00:15:25,136 --> 00:15:27,127
lsn't that the girl who waved at you?

216
00:15:27,338 --> 00:15:30,171
l don't know, but l can
see through your sheet.

217
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,500
Yeah, that's her.

218
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:37,680
You know, it doesn't matter.
l'll never meet her.

219
00:15:37,915 --> 00:15:40,145
lt's impossible to find her apartment!

220
00:15:40,418 --> 00:15:43,945
She lives in some hot-girl
parallel universe or something.

221
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:46,414
What are you talking about?

222
00:15:46,924 --> 00:15:50,052
She lives on the 2nd floor,
7th apartment from the left.

223
00:15:50,261 --> 00:15:53,992
No, she lives on the 3rd floor,
8th apartment from the left.

224
00:15:54,265 --> 00:15:57,496
No. Those first two windows,
that's the lobby.

225
00:15:57,702 --> 00:16:01,160
That other window is the stairway.
You've been counting wrong.

226
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:04,567
l did not know that!
Thank you, Monica.

227
00:16:04,775 --> 00:16:07,676
l almost lost another girl
because of counting!

228
00:16:10,715 --> 00:16:14,116
-So you ready?
-Yeah, l'll just get my coat.

229
00:16:14,886 --> 00:16:17,320
-Could you get that?
-Sure.

230
00:16:26,531 --> 00:16:28,192
No! No!

231
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:38,835
First, l would like to say
thank you for seeing me again.

232
00:16:39,076 --> 00:16:40,236
That's all right.

233
00:16:40,478 --> 00:16:44,915
But l feel obligated to tell you
that this meeting is being videotaped.

234
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:54,883
Well, first, l would like to start
by apologizing for kissing you...

235
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:57,184
...and for yelling at you.

236
00:16:57,662 --> 00:16:58,993
Fair enough.

237
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:04,361
Now, you're probably going to hire
one of the people who did not...

238
00:17:06,704 --> 00:17:09,104
...yell at you and storm out.

239
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:12,069
And l think that's a big mistake.
And here's why.

240
00:17:12,343 --> 00:17:16,780
l made a huge fool of myself,
and l came back. That shows courage.

241
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:21,442
When l thought you wanted sex
in exchange for this job, l said no.

242
00:17:21,686 --> 00:17:23,210
That shows integrity.

243
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:26,185
And l was not afraid
to stand up for myself...

244
00:17:26,424 --> 00:17:28,619
...and that shows courage.

245
00:17:31,195 --> 00:17:34,358
Now, l know that l've
already said courage...

246
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:36,965
...but you've got to have courage.

247
00:17:38,302 --> 00:17:43,035
And finally, when l thought
you were making sexual advances...

248
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,401
...l said no,
and l was not litigious.

249
00:17:45,643 --> 00:17:47,770
So there you go!
You got courage...

250
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:51,608
...you got integrity,
you got courage again...

251
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,407
...and not litigious.

252
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,812
Look, Mr....

253
00:17:59,056 --> 00:18:00,387
Zelner.

254
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:01,616
l knew that!

255
00:18:01,826 --> 00:18:03,885
Oh, l knew that.

256
00:18:05,296 --> 00:18:07,423
l really, really want this job.

257
00:18:07,632 --> 00:18:11,625
And l think l would be
really good at it.

258
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:16,405
You know what?

259
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:20,577
l may regret this...

260
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:23,174
...but l'll give you a shot.

261
00:18:23,414 --> 00:18:25,974
You are? Really?

262
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:28,916
Thank you. Oh, God!

263
00:18:29,353 --> 00:18:31,913
Would it be inappropriate
if l gave you a hug?

264
00:18:33,924 --> 00:18:35,653
Well, how about a handshake?

265
00:18:37,128 --> 00:18:38,425
Oh, God! l'm sorry!

266
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:44,092
l did not mean to touch that!
l mean, you!

267
00:18:44,535 --> 00:18:46,196
There!

268
00:18:47,705 --> 00:18:51,266
l'm gonna leave.
Thank you very much.

269
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:53,371
Hey, l'll see you Monday.

270
00:18:58,182 --> 00:18:59,171
Are you tired?

271
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,442
You better believe he's tired
after the day we had!

272
00:19:02,687 --> 00:19:05,451
lf you know what l mean.
Do you know what l mean?

273
00:19:06,157 --> 00:19:08,887
Honey, the tortilla chips
know what you mean.

274
00:19:10,861 --> 00:19:12,658
Do you like that badge l got you?

275
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:14,558
Oh, yeah, it's so cool.

276
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:19,799
Now, l gotta go.
Officer Bing's got a 1 0-1 00.

277
00:19:21,972 --> 00:19:23,530
That's pee-pee.

278
00:19:27,178 --> 00:19:29,738
Phoebe, you have a twig in your hair.

279
00:19:32,717 --> 00:19:35,584
We kind of took a detour
on our way over here.

280
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,415
We were strolling through the park
and no one was around, so....

281
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,015
-You didn't.
-We did!

282
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,924
We violated section 1 2,
paragraph 7 of the criminal code.

283
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:51,500
The park, huh?

284
00:19:53,237 --> 00:19:55,034
Public place.

285
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:59,004
l hear you.
Can you excuse me for a second?

286
00:20:08,052 --> 00:20:09,679
Hi, Chandler.

287
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,115
Monica, this is the men's room.

288
00:20:13,357 --> 00:20:14,881
lsn't it?

289
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:18,419
Yes, it is.

290
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:22,532
l've always found the men's bathroom
very sexual. Haven't you?

291
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,431
No.

292
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:28,194
And if l did, l don't think
we'd be going out.

293
00:20:30,107 --> 00:20:32,337
Okay, l don't want
to disappoint you...

294
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:36,947
...and l really don't want to disappoint
the guy in the second stall....

295
00:20:37,114 --> 00:20:38,809
Sorry, man.

296
00:20:40,184 --> 00:20:42,812
But come on, this is getting ridiculous.

297
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,920
Come on, we can't let them win!

298
00:20:45,956 --> 00:20:50,359
We've proved that we are hot, okay?
So why are you obsessed about this?

299
00:20:50,594 --> 00:20:52,323
Phoebe and Gary are in that...

300
00:20:52,596 --> 00:20:55,030
...''can't keep their hands
off each other'' phase!

301
00:20:55,332 --> 00:20:56,697
So?

302
00:20:57,201 --> 00:21:01,331
lt makes me really sad that
we're not really there anymore.

303
00:21:01,605 --> 00:21:04,301
Oh, is that what
this has all been about?

304
00:21:06,343 --> 00:21:09,141
Wasn't it a lot more exciting
when we were...

305
00:21:09,446 --> 00:21:11,676
...all over each other all the time?

306
00:21:11,882 --> 00:21:15,181
Yeah, that was great.
That was really great.

307
00:21:15,386 --> 00:21:18,822
But the truth is, l'm more
excited about where we are now.

308
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,087
-Really?
-Yeah.

309
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:24,659
l've never been in a relationship
this long before.

310
00:21:24,862 --> 00:21:28,354
To get past the beginning and
still want to be around each other...

311
00:21:28,566 --> 00:21:30,329
...l think that's incredible.

312
00:21:30,568 --> 00:21:33,469
And the fact that
this is happening with you...

313
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:35,965
...l think that's pretty exciting.

314
00:21:40,544 --> 00:21:42,375
That's so sweet.

315
00:21:43,981 --> 00:21:47,417
l know that l was acting
a little crazy...

316
00:21:47,685 --> 00:21:49,880
...but l feel the same way.

317
00:21:55,092 --> 00:21:56,753
You know what l just realized?

318
00:21:56,994 --> 00:21:59,554
You just freaked out
about our relationship.

319
00:21:59,763 --> 00:22:01,162
-l did not.
-Yes, you did!

320
00:22:01,398 --> 00:22:02,888
Admit it. You freaked out!

321
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:05,568
l freaked out a little.

322
00:22:05,769 --> 00:22:08,499
A little?
You freaked out bigtime, okay?

323
00:22:08,772 --> 00:22:10,740
And l fixed it!
We have switched places.

324
00:22:10,941 --> 00:22:16,106
l am the relationship king, and you
are the crazy, irrational screwup!

325
00:22:20,784 --> 00:22:22,411
And now we're back.

326
00:22:31,962 --> 00:22:34,522
l cannot believe Ross is buying this.

327
00:22:34,732 --> 00:22:37,030
Thank God!
l can't watch him anymore.

328
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:38,793
You guys ready?

329
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,806
By the way, thank you for
loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.

330
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:47,575
Man, they cannot get enough!
