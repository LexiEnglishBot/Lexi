1
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:06,714
What? What did you... What?

2
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,300
I still love you.

3
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:13,971
I know I shouldn't even
be here telling you this.

4
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,432
You're with Chandler, a guy I really like.

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,600
You say he's straight, I'll believe you.

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,606
After seeing you, I knew if I didn't
tell you I'd always regret it.

7
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,943
Letting you go was
the stupidest thing I ever did.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,864
You're really not
supposed to be back here.

9
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:37,077
I'm sorry. I know this is
the wrong time and the wrong place...

10
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,121
...but I had to tell you.

11
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,166
I want to spend my life with you
and marry you.

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,753
I want to have kids with you.

13
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,631
Oh, my God.

14
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,301
Why don't they put chairs back here?

15
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:57,014
I know this is crazy, but am I too late?

16
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,976
Yes, you're too late.
Where was all this three years ago?

17
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,604
I know. I was an idiot.

18
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,190
And I tried to forget you. I really did.

19
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:11,236
After we had lunch last year,
I spent six months in Africa trying to forget.

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,823
- What were you doing in Africa?
- Working with blind kids.

21
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,534
What are you doing to me?

22
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,620
Look, I...

23
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:23,415
I'm sorry, but it's not gonna happen.

24
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:27,169
That's fine. I'll walk away.
And I'll never bother you again.

25
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,256
Only if you tell me Chandler's
willing to give you everything I am.

26
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,426
Well, he is. I mean...

27
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,970
...marriage is all he talks about.

28
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,263
My goodness.

29
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,100
In fact, I'm the one making him wait.

30
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,476
- You are?
- Yeah.

31
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,645
- Why?
- Why?

32
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,564
Because of the government.

33
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,358
Isn't it incredible?

34
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,611
Monica and Chandler
are getting married.

35
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,906
I know. They'll be so happy together.

36
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,034
Two best friends in love.
How often does that happen?

37
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,245
- Not that often.
- No.

38
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,831
I'm so happy for them.

39
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,500
Me too. So happy for them.

40
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,587
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.

41
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:56,008
- Oh, no! God, definitely not jealous.
- Mm-mm.

42
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:04,725
I'm probably 98 percent happy
and maybe 2 percent jealous.

43
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,518
What's 2 percent? That's nothing.

44
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,270
Totally.

45
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,400
- I'm like 90-10.
- Yeah. Me too.

46
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,365
Hey, have you guys seen Chandler?

47
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,622
No. But you know who
was looking for you?

48
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,081
Tennille.

49
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,926
So that marriage stuff
you were saying yesterday?

50
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,720
- You don't really believe that.
- Sure, I do.

51
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:45,557
In fact, I think the whole concept
of marriage is unnatural.

52
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,561
Look at pigs. Let's take
a second here and look at pigs.

53
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,105
Pigs don't mate for life.

54
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,943
A pig can have 100 sexual partners
in a lifetime.

55
00:03:56,194 --> 00:04:00,197
And that's just an ordinary pig,
not even a pig that's good at sports.

56
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,699
Wait a minute.

57
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,870
Are you telling me
you may never want to get married?

58
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,623
Never say never, but, probably...

59
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,291
...yeah, never.

60
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,543
Oh, my God.

61
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,588
Then what are we even doing?
What is this?

62
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,217
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what is all this pressure?

63
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,552
Is this some new strategy?

64
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:26,515
Why don't you put down your copy
of The Rules, huh, man-trap?

65
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,018
You know what? I gotta go.

66
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,815
It's okay. I got a plan.

67
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,115
- We're gonna find love.
- Definitely.

68
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,327
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that.

69
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:52,124
That's what makes it so easy to be
80 percent happy for Monica and Chandler.

70
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,295
- Would be nice to have a guarantee.
- What do you mean?

71
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,797
Some people make deals with a friend.

72
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:03,635
Like if neither of them are married
by 40, they marry each other.

73
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,512
- You mean a backup?
- Exactly.

74
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,514
Yeah, yeah. I've got that.

75
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,517
- You do?
- Mm-hm.

76
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,019
- Who?
- Joey?

77
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,188
- Joey? Are you serious?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,107
Yeah, I locked him in years ago.

79
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:25,324
Wait. So if neither of you are
married by 40, you'll marry Joey?

80
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,284
Yep. We shook on it.

81
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,955
Yeah. But believe me, that is not
how he wanted to seal the deal.

82
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,666
Seriously?

83
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,835
I think his exact words were...

84
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,839
Charming.

85
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,842
- Ah, he's just a backup.
- Yeah.

86
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,226
Hey, Monica.

87
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,645
Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?

88
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,940
It's for my boat. Cool, huh?

89
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,859
Yeah, it's great.

90
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,612
What's the matter? Talk to the captain.

91
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,992
Just realizing
I'm in a dead-end relationship.

92
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,952
Chandler's giving you a hard time?

93
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,498
I don't want to get married tomorrow.
But I want to believe...

94
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,751
...we're going somewhere,
that I'm not wasting my time.

95
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,088
- You know Chandler.
- No, I don't know Chandler.

96
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:25,425
Not anymore.
It's like something's changed.

97
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,927
Maybe you changed.

98
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,262
I didn't change.

99
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,390
Maybe that's the problem.

100
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,977
- What?
- Chandler is a complex fellow.

101
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,897
One who is unlikely to take a wife.

102
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,070
Does he think I'll just
wait around for nothing?

103
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:48,323
Face it. Chandler is against marriage.

104
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,575
And always will be.

105
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,538
Well, there's some people
who do want to marry me.

106
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,207
- There are?
- Yeah. Richard.

107
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,584
Richard said he wants to marry you?

108
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:04,297
- And Chandler says he hates marriage?
- That's right.

109
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,134
Chandler loves marriage!

110
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,555
You just told me he hates marriage!

111
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,308
That he's a complex fellow
who's unlikely to take a wife!

112
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,103
That he's against marriage
and always will be!

113
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,730
You got that from what I said?

114
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,407
- Rach.
- Hey, you.

115
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,535
- Hey, come on in.
- Thank you.

116
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,997
I'm so sorry
to hear about you and Elizabeth.

117
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:41,251
Thanks. Yeah, I really thought
we'd be able to make it work.

118
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,587
I guess it just wasn't meant to be.

119
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,380
Yeah. Love.

120
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,341
It's a tricky business, isn't it?

121
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,719
I guess so.

122
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,388
So, what do you say we make a pact?

123
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,142
If you and I are both single by 40,
we get married.

124
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:00,437
I mean, we know each other,
we like each other...

125
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:04,649
...we've already slept together,
so there'll be no surprises there.

126
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,610
No, like, "What's that?"

127
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:14,159
- Oh, you want me to be your backup.
- Exactly.

128
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,495
Oh, yeah. I already have one.

129
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,289
- Who?
- Phoebe.

130
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,790
Phoebe?

131
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,419
But she just said Joey is her backup.

132
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,922
Oh, I don't think so.

133
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:31,510
I just spoke with her.
She said that she and Joey made a deal.

134
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,679
That's impossible.
We have had a deal for years.

135
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,348
We shook on it.

136
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,060
Although, believe me,
she wanted to do a lot more than that.

137
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,690
Where have you been?

138
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,611
I was making a coconut phone
with the Professor.

139
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,533
Richard told Monica
he wants to marry her.

140
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,785
- What?
- I've been looking for you.

141
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,411
Stop messing with her!

142
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:02,415
And I would have if these damn
boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!

143
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,210
- Oh, my God!
- I know! They suck!

144
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,297
He's not supposed to ask her
to marry him! I am!

145
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,924
- I know!
- What...?

146
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,886
You know what I'll do?
I'll go over there and kick his ass!

147
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,763
Will you help me?

148
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,601
Look, us getting our asses kicked
is not a solution.

149
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,687
Okay?

150
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,274
- Look, just go and find Monica.
- You're right.

151
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,734
I'm gonna get the ring...

152
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,403
...I'll go find her...

153
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,071
...and I'll propose!

154
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,240
Dude! Dude! Dude!

155
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,494
That coconut phone
might be good for the boat.

156
00:09:55,219 --> 00:10:00,265
Hi.

157
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,811
I don't know why I'm here.

158
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,063
I didn't ask.

159
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,984
You want to come in?

160
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,652
I don't know.

161
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,155
Oh, okay.

162
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,117
I'll just leave the door open
and go sit on the couch.

163
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,496
Chandler is such an idiot!

164
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:24,998
Drink?

165
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,752
- Scotch on the...
- Rocks with a twist?

166
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,004
I remember.

167
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,593
- You still smoking cigars?
- Uh...

168
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,346
No, no. That's art.

169
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,433
If it bothers you, I can put my art out.

170
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,853
No, that's okay.

171
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,815
So, Monica...

172
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,817
...let me ask you a question.

173
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,320
Since we broke up, do you ever...

174
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,821
...think about me?

175
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,451
Actually, I thought about you
a couple months ago.

176
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,787
- Really?
- Yeah, but it's because I...

177
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,499
...had an eye exam,
and I don't like my new eye doctor.

178
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,335
- Who is it?
- Edward Nevsky.

179
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,045
Yeah, he's no good.

180
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:17,300
Do you ever think about me in...

181
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,678
...a non-eye-doctor way?

182
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,221
No.

183
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,973
Ah.

184
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:29,604
Because getting over you was
the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

185
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,482
I never let myself think about you.

186
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,276
Wow.

187
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,034
Phoebe, you picked Joey and Ross?

188
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,953
You can't have two backups!

189
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,247
Of course I can.

190
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,083
It's just good sense
to back up your backup.

191
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,002
- Look, I've already lost Chandler.
- What?

192
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,171
Hey, Phoebe!

193
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,715
We're both backups?

194
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,551
How could you do this to me?

195
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:04,431
What are you complaining about?
You were both aware of the situation.

196
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,558
- I was not!
- No, we weren't!

197
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,437
This kind of back talk
isn't gonna fly when we're married.

198
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,398
You can't have both. Pick one.

199
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,108
- Pick me!
- No, pick me!

200
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,986
I don't want to end up an old maid.

201
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,530
Well, let's see.

202
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,991
Ross is a good father.

203
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,492
But...

204
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,120
...Joey has a boat. This is hard.

205
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,581
This is crazy. I want to switch to Rachel.

206
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,166
I want to switch too.

207
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,960
No, wait! Okay, just wait!

208
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,213
Wait, guys.
Don't make any rash decisions.

209
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,466
Remember my promise:

210
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,677
If we get married, three times a week.

211
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,471
Oh, my God. Phoebe...

212
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,098
I'm talking about massages.

213
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,517
No, I'm not.

214
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,356
I know how to settle this.
Here's what we'll do.

215
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,817
I'll write "Joey"...

216
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,319
...on one napkin.

217
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,447
And I'm going to write "Ross"
on the other napkin...

218
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,324
...and we'll pick one.

219
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,993
That person will be our backup.
Here we go.

220
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,870
- That sounds fair.
- All right.

221
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,663
Good. Switching them up.

222
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,415
Ooh...

223
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,795
- Pick one.
- Left.

224
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,923
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

225
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,511
- Ross.
- Joey.

226
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,807
- We should just switch.
- Absolutely.

227
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,312
I miss this apartment.

228
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,856
Now, this is a grownup's apartment.

229
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,484
- I should be with a grownup, you know?
- Yeah.

230
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:44,030
You're saying you need to be
with someone more mature.

231
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,865
Maybe someone with...

232
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,953
...a license to practice medicine.

233
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,955
Or a mustache.

234
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,000
Let's face it. I'm not a kid anymore.

235
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,128
I need to be with someone
who wants the same things.

236
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,716
Coming to my work and telling me
you love me, I want that!

237
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:08,096
Talking about pig sex over lunch,
I don't want that!

238
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,015
I think that's fair.

239
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,352
Fair? Please.
Don't even talk to me about fair.

240
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,480
Fair would've been you
wanting to marry me then.

241
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,108
Or Chandler wanting to marry me now.

242
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,736
Believe me, nothing about this
is fair. Nothing.

243
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,865
- Nothing! Nothing!
- It's okay.

244
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,284
Hey. Shh.

245
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,912
Nothing.

246
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,628
I don't know.

247
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,006
I know.

248
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,467
Yeah, I... I...

249
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,637
I have to figure...

250
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,473
...some stuff, before I can...

251
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,183
Yeah, I understand.

252
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,520
Take as much time as you want.

253
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,398
Ten, 20 minutes, if you need it.

254
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,861
I'll be here. Not smoking.

255
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,171
- Chandler.
- Where is she?

256
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,298
I'm not scared of you.

257
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,844
She's not here. And please come in.

258
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,555
Scotch on the rocks...

259
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,183
...with a twist, on a coaster.

260
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,935
Monica? Monica?

261
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,189
Okay, she was here. But she left.

262
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,815
Where did she go?

263
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,568
She said she had to think things over.

264
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:50,198
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.
I thought you were a good guy.

265
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,200
Oh, hey. Look, nothing happened.

266
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:56,329
Nothing happened? Nothing?
You didn't tell her you love her?

267
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,248
Well, all right, one thing happened.

268
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,334
You know what you did?

269
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,836
My girlfriend is thinking things over.

270
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,297
You made my girlfriend think!

271
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,676
Well, I'm sorry.

272
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,929
What's to think about? I love her.

273
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,225
Well, apparently I'm willing
to offer her things that you are not.

274
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,812
I'm willing to offer her those things.
This was just a plan.

275
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:25,608
To throw her off so when I offered
all these things, she'd be surprised.

276
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,821
If it helps, it worked very well.

277
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,866
It was working till you showed up,
you big tree.

278
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,454
This isn't fair.

279
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,125
You had your chance with her,
and you blew it!

280
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,502
This is my chance and I won't blow it...

281
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,005
...because we are meant for each other.

282
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:50,550
And this has all just been
one stupid mistake!

283
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,469
I was gonna propose tonight.

284
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,598
You were?

285
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,934
Yeah, I even...

286
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,103
...got a ring.

287
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,313
Did you get a ring?

288
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,274
No, I don't have a ring.

289
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,156
You go get her.

290
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,120
And can I give you a piece of advice?

291
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,205
If you do get her...

292
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,958
...don't let her go.

293
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,626
Trust me.

294
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:32,050
You know, Richard, you are a good guy.

295
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,803
I know.

296
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,347
I hate that.

297
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,238
- Dude.
- I've gotta find Monica.

298
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,448
She's gone.

299
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,243
- What?
- She had a bag and she left.

300
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,454
- What?
- She was crying.

301
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,916
She said you want different things
and she needs to think.

302
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,543
Why didn't you tell her it was a plan?

303
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,047
I did! I told her everything.
She wouldn't believe me.

304
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,423
Well, where...?

305
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,883
Where did she go?

306
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,677
To her parents'.
She said you shouldn't call.

307
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,388
But if I were you, I would.

308
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,599
Can't believe I ruined this.

309
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,185
I am so sorry, man.

310
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,365
You wanted it to be a surprise.

311
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,335
Oh, my God.

312
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,343
Chandler...

313
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,680
...in all my life...

314
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,016
...I never thought I would be so lucky...

315
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:11,315
...as to fall in love with my best...

316
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,235
My best...

317
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:19,073
- There's a reason why girls don't do this!
- Okay, okay, okay.

318
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,951
I'll do it. I thought...

319
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,832
Wait, I can do this.

320
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,881
I thought that it mattered...

321
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,634
...what I said or where I said it.

322
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,345
Then I realized...

323
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,891
...the only thing that matters is that you...

324
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,857
You make me happier
than I ever thought I could be.

325
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,029
And if you let me...

326
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,825
...I will spend the rest of my life
trying to make you feel the same way.

327
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,461
Monica...

328
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,714
...will you marry me?

329
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,551
Yes.

330
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,776
I knew you were likely to take a wife!

331
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,281
Can we come in yet?
We're dying out here!

332
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,076
Come in! Come in!

333
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,913
We're engaged!

334
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,419
Oh!

335
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,714
This is the least jealous I've ever been!

336
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,385
Oh, no, wait! This is wrong!
Ross isn't here!

337
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,844
- Oh.
- Oh.

338
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,390
He's done it three times.
He knows what it's about!

339
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,433
Yeah.

340
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,377
Oh, my darling

341
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:42,300
You were wonderful tonight
