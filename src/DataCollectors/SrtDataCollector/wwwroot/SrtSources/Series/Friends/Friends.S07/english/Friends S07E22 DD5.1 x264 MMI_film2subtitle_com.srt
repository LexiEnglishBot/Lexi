1
00:00:01,705 --> 00:00:05,559
I think I'll go with the chicken piccata
instead of the Cornish game hen.

2
00:00:05,775 --> 00:00:08,551
Will there be a vegetarian option,
you know, for me?

3
00:00:08,907 --> 00:00:10,330
Yes. Definitely.

4
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:11,478
What is it?

5
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:13,070
Dancing.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,110
- Hey.
- Hey.

7
00:00:17,326 --> 00:00:19,793
I saw the Porsche parked out front.

8
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:23,481
Can I get the keys? Thought
I'd take that bad boy for a spin.

9
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:28,593
Ross drives it? When I ask, you say
you're the only one allowed to drive it.

10
00:00:28,808 --> 00:00:32,212
He's my brother, plus he drives
so slow he could never hurt it.

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,165
It's a car, Monica, not a rocket ship.

12
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:39,798
Just replace the bulbs in the
brake lights after you're done.

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,172
- Hey.
- Hi.

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,762
Saw the Porsche. Looking good.
When can I take it out again?

15
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,487
- You let Joey drive it?
- I've never driven it. Not once.

16
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:58,655
Okay, once.
Okay, I drive it all the time.

17
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,161
So much for the "you-can-drive-it
but-don't-tell-Rachel" plan.

18
00:01:06,452 --> 00:01:08,361
Wow, I can't believe you lied to me.

19
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:13,545
I can fix this. Monica, Rachel thinks
all you talk about is the wedding.

20
00:01:16,472 --> 00:01:19,770
There. I've blown both your secrets.
Now we're even.

21
00:01:21,586 --> 00:01:26,308
I won't let you drive the Porsche
because you're a terrible driver.

22
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:28,958
There. That wasn't about the wedding.

23
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:35,388
If you want a ride in the Porsche,
I'll take you around the block.

24
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:37,101
You got a couple hours?

25
00:01:38,912 --> 00:01:43,076
The One With Chandler's Dad

26
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:19,331
Whew, that was a brisk ride.

27
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:25,000
- Take the top down, did you?
- Only way to fly.

28
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,906
Give me the keys. Monica's wrong.
I'm an excellent driver.

29
00:02:30,126 --> 00:02:34,194
You're fast and irresponsible.
That adds up to a bad driver.

30
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:37,916
In high school, that added up
to head cheerleader.

31
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,499
Did you see the look
that girl just gave me?

32
00:02:45,886 --> 00:02:48,460
She must've seen me cruising
in the bad boy.

33
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,075
- She's checking out your beehive.
- What?

34
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:55,104
- Give me a brush.
- The keys.

35
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,904
- No way!
- Well, no brush.

36
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,927
Fine. It doesn't matter.

37
00:02:59,142 --> 00:03:03,935
If I remember correctly, there's
a comb on the floor of the bathroom.

38
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,197
Alimony.

39
00:03:25,514 --> 00:03:28,848
We still haven't gotten
an RSVP from your dad.

40
00:03:29,063 --> 00:03:33,582
Oh, right. Maybe that's because I
didn't send him an invitation.

41
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:35,322
Why not?

42
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:39,282
An invitation?
That's like almost asking him to come.

43
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:43,493
He's your father.
He should be at our wedding.

44
00:03:43,711 --> 00:03:46,451
I was gonna send him an invite
but then I saw the stamp.

45
00:03:46,702 --> 00:03:50,308
It was one of those Marilyn
Monroe stamps and I thought:

46
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,890
My dad has that dress.

47
00:03:53,452 --> 00:03:57,794
Wow. That must be a very different view
when he stands over an air vent.

48
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:02,004
You should see him singing
"Happy Birthday, Mr. President."

49
00:04:02,845 --> 00:04:04,198
We have to invite him.

50
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:08,374
I don't even know the man.
I haven't seen him in years.

51
00:04:08,587 --> 00:04:11,089
And when he finds out
he wasn't asked?

52
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,660
We don't run in the same circles.

53
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,757
I hang out with you guys and he...

54
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:19,578
...stars in a drag show in Vegas.

55
00:04:20,903 --> 00:04:23,156
I think I want to trade circles.

56
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:26,397
You don't want him there.
Nobody will stare at the bride...

57
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:29,941
...when the father of the groom
is wearing a backless dress.

58
00:04:30,157 --> 00:04:34,784
So what? As long as he's not wearing
a white dress and veil, I don't care.

59
00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:37,460
I think I need to do some shopping.

60
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:47,064
Nice.

61
00:04:49,293 --> 00:04:50,467
My God!

62
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,073
- What do you think you're doing?
- Just washing the windshield.

63
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:03,935
There's no way I'll let you
drive this car.

64
00:05:04,184 --> 00:05:06,995
- Couldn't find the comb?
- No.

65
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:09,085
Why don't you just hand over the keys.

66
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:10,720
Oh!

67
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:13,992
Do not start this car.

68
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,077
Okay, okay.
I will give you 20 bucks...

69
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:23,661
...if you get out of this car
right now. Hey!

70
00:05:25,754 --> 00:05:26,928
Look.

71
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:29,683
If you're so freaked out,
just get in the car.

72
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,554
With you? Yeah, right.

73
00:05:31,808 --> 00:05:32,947
All right.

74
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,897
Okay, okay, okay.

75
00:05:39,115 --> 00:05:43,005
- What are you doing? Get in the front.
- In the death seat?!

76
00:05:49,656 --> 00:05:51,388
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, sweetie.

77
00:05:51,604 --> 00:05:55,009
- Ready to go?
- My purse is at Monica's. I'll be back.

78
00:05:55,223 --> 00:05:56,991
- Wait a minute.
- What? Oh.

79
00:06:03,816 --> 00:06:05,311
That one kept going.

80
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:12,335
So, you and Phoebe, huh?

81
00:06:12,584 --> 00:06:15,360
- How long have you been going out?
- Over a month.

82
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,042
We ought to get
to know each other better.

83
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:21,801
- Sure. I'd like that.
- Yeah. So, uh...

84
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,476
What's your name?

85
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,578
- It's Jake.
- Joey.

86
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:31,989
- Do you like the Knicks?
- Yeah, big fan.

87
00:06:32,206 --> 00:06:35,646
Me too. There's a game on Tuesday.
Do you want to go?

88
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:39,535
Great! Let me make sure I'm not
doing anything Tuesday.

89
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:48,970
Here.

90
00:06:49,672 --> 00:06:52,933
- What's this?
- Your suitcase. We're going to Vegas.

91
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:56,306
Are you serious? Eloping?
No more stupid wedding stuff.

92
00:06:56,526 --> 00:07:00,904
No more these flowers, these flowers.
Think of the money we'll save.

93
00:07:01,118 --> 00:07:04,973
We're not eloping. I love the flowers.
Can our wedding be bigger, please?

94
00:07:06,163 --> 00:07:07,895
We're going to see your dad.

95
00:07:08,146 --> 00:07:10,578
I want to get to know
my father-in-law.

96
00:07:10,825 --> 00:07:12,972
We already went over this and I won.

97
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:16,073
No, you didn't.
Honey, just so you know...

98
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:19,798
Now that you're marrying me,
you don't get to win anymore.

99
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:24,277
Forget it. I don't want to go.
I don't want to see him.

100
00:07:24,846 --> 00:07:27,135
I know your dad embarrassed you.

101
00:07:27,352 --> 00:07:29,890
All kids are embarrassed
by their parents.

102
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,362
You'd have to come up with a new word
for what I went through.

103
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:36,806
In high school,
he came to all my swim meets...

104
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,799
...dressed as a different
Hollywood starlet.

105
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,295
It's hard enough to be 14.

106
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:46,374
You're skinny, you're wearing Speedos
that your mom promised you'd grow into.

107
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:51,389
You look up in the stands.
There's your dad cheering you on.

108
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:55,491
Dressed as Carmen Miranda,
wearing a headdress with real fruit...

109
00:07:55,742 --> 00:08:00,119
...that he will later hand out
to your friends as a healthy snack.

110
00:08:00,995 --> 00:08:02,489
But he was there!

111
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,654
My dad didn't come
to one of my Brownie meetings.

112
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:07,421
You were a Brownie?

113
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:09,509
No. I ate them.

114
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:16,054
The point is, he was at every one
of your swim meets, cheering you on.

115
00:08:16,303 --> 00:08:18,177
That's a pretty great dad.

116
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,300
He had sex with Mr. Garibaldi.

117
00:08:20,756 --> 00:08:23,781
- Who's Mr. Garibaldi?
- Does it matter?!

118
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:31,809
You're not 14 anymore, okay?
Maybe it's time you let that stuff go.

119
00:08:32,934 --> 00:08:38,284
If he's not at your wedding, you'll
regret it for the rest of your life.

120
00:08:40,657 --> 00:08:43,433
Okay, but I'm just doing this for you.

121
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,047
- So I never get to win anymore?
- How much did you ever win before?

122
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,962
You know how when you're wearing pants
and you lean forward...

123
00:09:00,176 --> 00:09:02,394
...I check out your underwear?

124
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:05,874
Well, when Jake did it...

125
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,495
...I saw that he was wearing
women's underwear.

126
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,440
I know. They were mine.

127
00:09:12,735 --> 00:09:13,672
Oh!

128
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:17,392
No, no, wait. That's weird.

129
00:09:18,094 --> 00:09:21,427
We were goofing around,
and I dared him to try them on.

130
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:22,996
That's weird!

131
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:27,027
- I'm wearing his briefs right now.
- That's kind of hot.

132
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:32,770
I think so too. And that little flap?
It's great for holding my lipstick.

133
00:09:38,342 --> 00:09:40,109
I wouldn't know about that.

134
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:45,882
Jake says that women's underwear
is actually more comfortable.

135
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:48,947
He loves how silk feels
against his skin.

136
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:53,053
Next he'll say your high heels
are good for his posture.

137
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:57,332
There's nothing wrong with Jake.
He is all man.

138
00:09:57,547 --> 00:09:59,041
I think more than you.

139
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:03,071
He looked like a real lumberjack
in those pink lacies.

140
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:08,326
I'm just saying only a man completely
secure in his masculinity...

141
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,839
...could wear women's underwear.
I don't think you could.

142
00:10:12,055 --> 00:10:16,017
- I am secure with my masculinity.
- Okay, whatever.

143
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,827
You've seen my huge
stack of porn, right?

144
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:23,874
Here you go.

145
00:10:26,216 --> 00:10:28,921
Look all you want.
There's nothing there.

146
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:40,619
Slow down,
or I am returning to the back seat.

147
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,255
Would you calm down?

148
00:10:43,472 --> 00:10:46,497
No! You're driving 15 miles
over the speed limit.

149
00:10:46,743 --> 00:10:51,298
I'm driving 5 miles over the limit.
They raised it by 10.

150
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:54,003
What, are they crazy?!

151
00:10:59,163 --> 00:11:02,081
God, I forgot how much I love driving.

152
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:05,001
I have got to get my license renewed.

153
00:11:08,105 --> 00:11:12,138
You don't have a valid driver's
license? Pull over right now.

154
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,169
Ross, you're so tense.
You just gotta relax, okay?

155
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:20,513
Just need to relax. All right?
Just need to relax.

156
00:11:20,908 --> 00:11:24,514
What are you...? That's not funny.
Stop horsing around.

157
00:11:24,735 --> 00:11:27,131
I am not horsing around, okay?

158
00:11:27,345 --> 00:11:30,441
I am "Porsche-ing" around.

159
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,625
Uh-oh.

160
00:11:37,643 --> 00:11:42,649
Stay calm. Nothing will happen.
You're not in that much trouble.

161
00:11:43,105 --> 00:11:44,208
Really? You think so?

162
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,205
I was talking to myself.
You're going down!

163
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,742
Has someone taken your order?

164
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:36,437
Oh, yeah. She did. He did. She?

165
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:38,452
I'm sorry, I'm new. I don't...

166
00:12:40,755 --> 00:12:43,945
- I just ordered a beer.
- You're straight. I get it.

167
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:49,131
If we called your dad,
we'd have better seats.

168
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:53,097
I don't want him to know we're
here yet. I'm not ready for that.

169
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,055
Besides, he won't be too happy
to see me either.

170
00:12:56,238 --> 00:12:57,661
Why not?

171
00:12:58,498 --> 00:12:59,922
I don't know if I told you...

172
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:04,332
...but he's kind of tried to contact me
a lot the last few years.

173
00:13:04,552 --> 00:13:05,524
What?

174
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,831
Yeah. He's made phone calls,
written letters.

175
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:12,647
He came to New York.
But I always said I was too busy.

176
00:13:12,868 --> 00:13:15,964
It's very "Cats in the Cradle."
I don't want to get into it.

177
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:20,376
Here we go.

178
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:24,137
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome the incomparable...

179
00:13:24,315 --> 00:13:26,426
...Helena Handbasket.

180
00:13:30,682 --> 00:13:32,341
Hello, darlings.

181
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,504
And there's Daddy.

182
00:13:41,084 --> 00:13:44,310
Switch places with me. Come on!
I'll go under, you go over.

183
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:47,446
- Yeah, I'll get right on that.
- Come on!

184
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:50,612
- What? No. Hey, Rach, come on.
- Come on!

185
00:13:50,826 --> 00:13:52,902
I'm sure we won't get arrested
for this.

186
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,313
God!

187
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:03,489
Hi, officer.
Was I going a little too fast?

188
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:05,287
Oh, my God.

189
00:14:06,203 --> 00:14:09,323
- Can I see your license, please?
- Absolutely.

190
00:14:09,543 --> 00:14:14,964
It's weird. I had a dream last night
that I was stopped by a policeman.

191
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,390
And then he...

192
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:19,976
Well, I probably shouldn't
tell you the rest.

193
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:22,335
He gave you a big...

194
00:14:22,591 --> 00:14:23,527
...fat...

195
00:14:23,773 --> 00:14:24,947
...ticket?

196
00:14:27,427 --> 00:14:32,326
- Your license.
- Yes. Here you go, Officer...

197
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,822
...Handsome.

198
00:14:34,593 --> 00:14:38,069
- It's Hanson.
- Oops, sorry. My mistake.

199
00:14:38,316 --> 00:14:39,905
Dear Lord!

200
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,392
- Wow!
- Here it comes.

201
00:14:43,848 --> 00:14:45,473
This is a great picture.

202
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:50,979
Really? You think so? You know,
I had just rolled right out of bed.

203
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:52,220
You look phenomenal.

204
00:14:52,441 --> 00:14:55,323
She should!
It was taken 10 years ago!

205
00:14:58,913 --> 00:15:03,220
You know, you're probably wondering
about the old date.

206
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:06,353
Yes, I am. You're an Aquarius, huh?

207
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,456
- I'll bet you're a Gemini.
- No.

208
00:15:10,672 --> 00:15:11,846
- Taurus?
- No.

209
00:15:12,551 --> 00:15:13,903
- Virgo?
- No.

210
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,089
- Sagittarius?
- Yep.

211
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:18,705
I knew it. I knew it!

212
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,943
- You won't speed anymore, right?
- I won't speed.

213
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:24,786
- And you promise to take care of this?
- I promise.

214
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,605
In the meantime, let him drive.
Does he have a license?

215
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,327
- Can he handle a stick?
- Well...

216
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:33,005
I can handle a stick!

217
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:52,518
- That can't be your father.
- I've been saying that for years.

218
00:15:52,736 --> 00:15:54,812
- Oh, my God!
- What?

219
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:57,498
That's Mr. Garibaldi
playing the piano.

220
00:16:11,592 --> 00:16:14,368
Hello, and welcome to the show.

221
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,370
I see some of our regulars
in the audience.

222
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:21,881
And a couple of irregulars.

223
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:28,114
- He's coming into the audience.
- Relax. You'll be fine.

224
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,316
Oh, much better.
You're invisible now.

225
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,720
- Where are you from?
- Bakersfield.

226
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:36,988
- I'm sorry?
- Bakersfield.

227
00:16:37,582 --> 00:16:40,251
No, no, I heard. I'm just sorry.

228
00:16:41,548 --> 00:16:45,059
It can't happen like this.
I'll meet you back at the hotel.

229
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,858
Look, a standing ovation already.
So early in the show.

230
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:53,856
Turn around, darling.
Let me see your pretty face.

231
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:06,032
Can we have our drinks, please?
Waiter?...tress?

232
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,026
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

233
00:17:22,463 --> 00:17:23,886
Check it out.

234
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,358
How much of a man am I?

235
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:36,205
Wow, nice.
Manly, and also kind of a slut.

236
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,934
I'm beginning to see what Jake
was talking about.

237
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:43,198
The silk feels really good.

238
00:17:44,103 --> 00:17:48,789
And things aren't as smashed down
as I thought they would be.

239
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,182
That's great.

240
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:53,248
You have so many more choices
than with men's underwear.

241
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:58,670
Bikini, French cut, thong.
And the fabrics: Cotton, silk, lace.

242
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:02,508
You know what I've always
wondered about? Pantyhose!

243
00:18:02,752 --> 00:18:06,916
The way they start at your toe,
then they go all the way up to...

244
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:14,539
- I should go take these off, shouldn't I?
- I think it's important you do.

245
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:17,772
What's your name?

246
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,954
Chandler.

247
00:18:23,383 --> 00:18:24,392
Chandler?

248
00:18:24,984 --> 00:18:26,822
What an unusual name.

249
00:18:27,176 --> 00:18:30,366
You must have had terribly
fascinating parents.

250
00:18:30,795 --> 00:18:32,527
Oh, they're a hoot.

251
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,457
And who is your friend?

252
00:18:36,952 --> 00:18:39,205
I'm Monica.

253
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:43,272
- Monica. Where are you from?
- New York.

254
00:18:44,154 --> 00:18:46,550
I'm not very fond of New York.

255
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:48,875
Queens, I like.

256
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:52,746
What is this...

257
00:18:52,991 --> 00:18:56,953
...sparkling something, honey, huh?

258
00:18:58,315 --> 00:19:01,162
Actually, Monica and I are engaged.

259
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:03,878
Really?

260
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:06,654
Congratulations.

261
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:09,269
When's the big day?

262
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,815
In two weeks.

263
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,428
I see.

264
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:21,481
Well, I wish you both
a lifetime of happiness.

265
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:24,223
So, you're bald.

266
00:19:24,826 --> 00:19:25,691
Wait, wait.

267
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,606
We'd love it if you could be there.

268
00:19:33,976 --> 00:19:35,364
Really?

269
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:39,394
I know it would make me happy...

270
00:19:40,865 --> 00:19:42,145
...ma'am.

271
00:19:44,936 --> 00:19:47,367
Then I wouldn't miss it for the world.

272
00:19:48,832 --> 00:19:51,643
I'm getting all misty here.

273
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:55,714
You'd think I was having my legs waxed
or something.

274
00:19:59,304 --> 00:20:01,807
- You okay?
- Yeah.

275
00:20:02,331 --> 00:20:04,727
Thanks for making me do this.

276
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:09,626
Before we go on with the show,
I want to say to the bride and groom...

277
00:20:09,846 --> 00:20:12,692
...how lucky they are
to have found each other.

278
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,377
In every life a little rain must fall.

279
00:20:16,596 --> 00:20:18,126
Fortunately...

280
00:20:18,336 --> 00:20:20,174
...in my life...

281
00:20:34,931 --> 00:20:38,371
When I was growing up,
I played the one on the far left.

282
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,811
I think you've had enough fun
for today.

283
00:20:49,822 --> 00:20:51,934
Remind me to introduce you
to someone.

284
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:53,541
- Who?
- Fourth gear.

285
00:20:57,441 --> 00:21:00,810
What does he want?
I wasn't doing anything.

286
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:05,640
Maybe he saw your hands slip briefly
from the 10 and 2:00 position.

287
00:21:08,157 --> 00:21:12,428
Maybe it's Sergeant Sagittarius
coming back to flirt some more.

288
00:21:14,003 --> 00:21:17,301
Perhaps he didn't tarnish
the badge enough.

289
00:21:18,699 --> 00:21:20,716
It's a different guy.

290
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:27,220
- Good evening, officer.
- Do you know how fast you were going?

291
00:21:27,432 --> 00:21:31,145
No, I don't, but it couldn't
have been more than 60.

292
00:21:31,364 --> 00:21:33,131
You're right. It was 37.

293
00:21:38,218 --> 00:21:39,533
Really?

294
00:21:40,305 --> 00:21:43,223
- Can I see your license, please?
- You're kidding.

295
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:46,875
You're not gonna give me a ticket
for driving too slow, are you?

296
00:21:47,263 --> 00:21:48,793
That's right.

297
00:21:52,586 --> 00:21:54,768
You wanna help me out here?

298
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:56,402
I'm sorry, what?

299
00:21:57,526 --> 00:22:02,117
Can you do your little thing
that you did before?

300
00:22:03,024 --> 00:22:04,304
I don't think so.

301
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,197
I don't think I want
to tarnish his badge.

302
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:18,680
You know, officer...

303
00:22:19,898 --> 00:22:22,436
I had the weirdest dream last night.

304
00:22:22,646 --> 00:22:24,378
Oh, my God!

305
00:22:25,325 --> 00:22:26,641
Your license, please.

306
00:22:28,526 --> 00:22:31,860
You don't want to hear
about my dream...

307
00:22:32,074 --> 00:22:33,604
...Officer...

308
00:22:33,815 --> 00:22:35,238
...Pretty?

309
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:40,179
It's Petty.

310
00:22:41,955 --> 00:22:44,244
I'll be right back with your ticket.

311
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,881
- You have a son.
- I know. I know.

312
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:58,059
- You feel better?
- Yeah. Much.

313
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,004
Listen...

314
00:23:00,465 --> 00:23:04,285
Not that I'm insecure
about my manhood or anything...

315
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:08,629
...but I think I need to hook up
with a woman right now.

316
00:23:09,163 --> 00:23:10,408
I understand.

317
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,371
You look familiar. Do I know you?

318
00:23:21,757 --> 00:23:22,896
I don't think so.

319
00:23:23,114 --> 00:23:25,546
Maybe it's because I'm on television.

320
00:23:27,811 --> 00:23:31,560
- I'm an actor on Days of our Lives.
- Wow. Really?

321
00:23:31,812 --> 00:23:34,588
- $4.50, please.
- Oh, let me get this.

322
00:23:45,415 --> 00:23:46,731
These are for you.
