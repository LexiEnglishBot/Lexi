1
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:15,139
- Hey.
- Hey, ha, ha.

2
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,313
Monica?

3
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:25,983
What time is it?

4
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,235
Uh, 9.

5
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,405
But it's dark out.

6
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,783
Um, well, that's because you always
sleep till noon, silly.

7
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,746
This is what 9 looks like.

8
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,249
I guess I'll get washed up then.

9
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,877
Watch that sunrise.

10
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,174
I'm really getting tired of
sneaking around all the time.

11
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:54,636
I know, me too. Hey, what if we went away
for the whole weekend? No interruptions.

12
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,930
And we could be naked the entire time.

13
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,557
All weekend?

14
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,434
- That's a whole lot of naked.
- Mm-hm.

15
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:05,064
Yeah, I could say I have a conference
and you can say you have a chef thing.

16
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,275
Oh, I've always wanted to go
to this culinary fair in Jersey!

17
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,611
Ha, ha, okay.
You know you're not, though.

18
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:12,946
- Right. Okay.
- Let's go.

19
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,657
Wait. What about Joey?

20
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,839
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend.

21
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,966
Going to this culinary fair in Jersey.

22
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:18,887
How weird! Chandler just told us
he's got a conference there. Huh.

23
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:23,350
Oh, that's funny, ha, ha. Seems like
Chandler's conference could've been...

24
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,435
...in Connecticut or Vermont.

25
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:31,275
I'm not in charge of where
the conference is held.

26
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:35,320
Do you want people to think it's
a fake conference? It's a real conference.

27
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,281
- Hey.
- Hey.

28
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,325
- Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
- No, she's out shopping.

29
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,579
- Damn.
- What's going on?

30
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,831
I told Emily to come.

31
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:50,002
And I just need to, you know,
talk to Rachel about it.

32
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,005
Wait a minute.

33
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,383
So when Emily comes,
you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?

34
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,636
I'm focusing on the
"I get to see my wife" part, all right...

35
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,347
...and not on the part
that makes me do this, huh?

36
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,897
So you'll never be in the same room together?
How is that even gonna work?

37
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,566
I have no idea. I mean...

38
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,736
But I assure you, I will figure it out.

39
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,365
It doesn't seem like it's gonna work.

40
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,493
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

41
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,912
- Hey.
- Hey.

42
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,371
What's going on?

43
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,875
We're flipping Monica's mattress.

44
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:36,548
So I'm thinking, basically,
we pick it up, and then we flip it.

45
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,219
That's better than my way.

46
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,514
Oh, hey, guys, would you flip mine too?

47
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,850
- Oh, man.
- Oh.

48
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,189
Oh, look! A letter from my mom.

49
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,610
So, Rach?

50
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,946
You know how Emily's coming, right?

51
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,822
Oh, yeah. I know.

52
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,157
Can you hear anything?

53
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,035
Oh, yeah, somebody just said,
"Can you hear anything?"

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,001
Hey, Joey's ass.

55
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,463
What are you doing?

56
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,424
Remember when they got
in that big fight and broke up...

57
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,427
...and we were all stuck in here
all night with no food?

58
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:26,598
Well, when Ross said "Rachel" at the wedding,
I figured it was gonna happen again.

59
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,642
You know? So I hid this in here.

60
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,937
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...

61
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,314
Ooh, Mad Libs. Mine!

62
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,359
Condoms?

63
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,031
Hey, you don't know how long
we're gonna be in here.

64
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,367
We may have to re-populate the Earth.

65
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,788
And condoms are the way to do that?

66
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:56,169
Anyway, it all boils down to this.

67
00:04:56,337 --> 00:05:00,924
- The last time I talked to Emily...
- Aah! Oh, my God! Our dog died!

68
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:06,847
- What?
- Oh, my God. LaPooh, our dog!

69
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,683
LaPooh's still alive?

70
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:14,688
Oh! It says he was hit by
an ice-cream truck and dragged for...

71
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,692
...19 blocks!

72
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,155
- Oh! Oh, my God.
- Sweetie, we heard you crying.

73
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,199
- Please don't cry.
- It's LaPooh!

74
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,744
I know, it's LaPooh right now
but it'll get better.

75
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,087
I can't believe it! We're here!

76
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,758
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows!
Oh, I love that!

77
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,844
You should live with Joey.
Rolos everywhere.

78
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:51,099
- Oh. Okay, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

79
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,105
Oh, yes!

80
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,567
Monica, get in here.
It's a high-speed car chase on!

81
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,611
We're switching rooms.

82
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,780
Oh, dear God, they gave us glasses!

83
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,533
No, they gave us glasses
with lipstick on them.

84
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,204
If they didn't change the glasses,
who knows what else they didn't change.

85
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,541
Oh, come on, sweetie. I just want
this weekend to be perfect, okay?

86
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,960
- We can change rooms, can't we?
- Okay.

87
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:23,423
Okay, but let's do it now, though,
because Chopper 5 just lost its feed!

88
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,097
Hey, so, uh...

89
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:33,266
You know how there was something
I wanted to talk to you about?

90
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,227
Oh, yeah.

91
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,354
Well...

92
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,731
...you know I'm trying to work
things out with Emily.

93
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,775
Mm-hm.

94
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,693
Well, there's this...

95
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,821
...one thing.

96
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,616
Okay, here goes.

97
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,747
I made a promise that... Oh, hey.

98
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,958
- What?
- Your nose is bleeding.

99
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,252
- Oh, God!
- You're bleeding.

100
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,628
Ah. Ah, not again.

101
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,755
This happened when my grandfather died.

102
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,924
It's... Ugh, sorry.

103
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,801
Oh, gross, unh.

104
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,721
Okay. So I'm sorry.
What did you wanna tell me?

105
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,518
- Um...
- Ugh.

106
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,022
Sorry. Sorry.

107
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,899
Okay.

108
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,360
I, uh...

109
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,029
I can't see you anymore.

110
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:31,783
Yeah, I know, it's ridiculous.
I can't see you, either.

111
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,246
I think you'll find this room
more to your liking.

112
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,664
Okay, great.

113
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,753
They say he's only got half a tank left.

114
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:48,383
Half a tank? We still got a lot
of high-speed chasing to do!

115
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,636
- We're switching rooms again.
- What? Why?

116
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,599
This is a garden-view room
and we paid for an ocean-view room.

117
00:07:55,808 --> 00:08:00,979
Our last ocean-view room
was unacceptable to you.

118
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,983
Excuse me. Um, can I talk to you
over here for just a second?

119
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,651
Uh-huh.

120
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,865
- Chandler.
- Yeah?

121
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,744
Look, these clowns are trying to
take us for a ride. I won't let them.

122
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,871
We're not a couple of suckers.

123
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,248
I hear you, Mugsy.

124
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,752
But, look, all these rooms are fine.

125
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,546
Okay? Can you just pick one
so I can watch the...

126
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:30,509
Have a perfect, magical
weekend together with you?

127
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,431
- Okay, this one I like.
- Nothing.

128
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,099
Nothing. It's over.

129
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,728
Damn it, this is regularly scheduled
programming!

130
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,648
Can we turn the TV off, okay?

131
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,275
Do we really wanna spend
the weekend like this?

132
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,695
I'm sorry, am I getting in the way
of all the room-switching fun?

133
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:54,032
- Ha, ha, don't blame me for ruining tonight.
- Who should I blame?

134
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,868
The nice bellman who had to drag
our luggage to 10 rooms?

135
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,037
Or the idiot who thought
he could drive...

136
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,541
...from Albany to Canada
on a half a tank of gas?

137
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,961
Do not speak ill of the dead.

138
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,758
We're supposed to be spending
a romantic weekend together.

139
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,176
What's the matter with you?

140
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,096
I just wanna watch a little television.
What's the big deal?

141
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,973
Jeez, relax, Mom.

142
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,143
What did you say?

143
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:26,106
I said, "Jeez, relax, Mon."

144
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,367
Hey.

145
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:43,707
Rachel, I've been wanting to tell you something
and I just have to get it out.

146
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,500
Okay. All right. What's up?

147
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,295
Okay.

148
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:54,342
You know how you told me I should do
whatever it takes to fix my marriage?

149
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,721
Yeah, I told you to give Emily
whatever she wants.

150
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:04,519
And while that was good advice,
you should know that what she wants...

151
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,147
Yeah?

152
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,735
...is for me not to see you anymore.

153
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:18,742
Well, that's crazy. You can't do that.
What are you gonna tell her?

154
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,333
Oh, my God.

155
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,377
Oh, you've already agreed to this,
haven't you?

156
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,672
It's awful, I know. Uh, it's... Heh.

157
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,676
I mean, I feel terrible, but I have to do this
if I want my marriage to work.

158
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:41,389
And I do. I have to make
this marriage work. I have to.

159
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,230
But the good thing is, we can still
see each other until she gets here.

160
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,150
Oh!

161
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:57,489
Oh, lucky me! Oh, my God!
That is good news, Ross!

162
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,159
I think that's the best news I've heard
since LaPooh died!

163
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:09,042
You have no idea what a nightmare
this has been. Uh, this is so hard.

164
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,544
Oh, yeah, really? Is it, Ross?

165
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:15,632
- Well, let me make this a little easier for you.
- What are you doing?

166
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,967
- Storming out.
- Rachel, this is your apartment.

167
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,970
Yeah? Well, that's how mad I am!

168
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,112
Damn Rolos!

169
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,781
- Hey, you're back.
- Hey.

170
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,282
How was your conference?

171
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,662
It was terrible. I fought with
my colleagues for the entire time.

172
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,164
Are you kidding with this?

173
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,709
Uh, so your weekend was a bust?

174
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:54,295
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump
waiting for an elevator.

175
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,841
- Hi.
- Hey, you're back too.

176
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:01,010
Yeah. Um, Chandler,
could I talk to you outside for a second?

177
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,180
- How was your chef thing?
- Ugh. It was awful.

178
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,058
I guess some people don't
appreciate really good food.

179
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,978
Maybe it was the kind of food
that tasted good at first...

180
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,273
...but then made everybody vomit
and have diarrhea.

181
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,236
- Chandler.
- Monica.

182
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,825
I wanna know how much the room was.
I'll pay my half.

183
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,118
Okay, fine. $300.

184
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,663
- Three hundred dollars?
- Yeah. Just think of it as $25 per room.

185
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,961
What are you guys woofing about?

186
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,130
Chandler stole a 20 from my purse!

187
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,758
No!

188
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,429
You know what?
Now that I think about it...

189
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,807
...I constantly find myself
without 20s, and you...

190
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,934
...always have lots.

191
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,484
You should've seen the look on her face.

192
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:01,237
I don't want Rachel to hate me.
I don't know what to do.

193
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,573
- You want my advice?
- Yes. Please.

194
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,701
- You're not gonna like it.
- That's okay.

195
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,788
You got married too fast.

196
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,541
- That's not advice.
- I told you.

197
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,922
I'm going to the bathroom.

198
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:24,677
Man, if anyone asked me to give up
any of you, I don't think I could do it.

199
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:25,887
Me neither.

200
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,847
Maybe I could do it.

201
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,353
- Hi.
- Hey.

202
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,356
I know you guys heard about
the whole thing with me and Ross.

203
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:41,027
But I've been obsessing about it all day
and would love not to talk about it.

204
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,404
Uh, I don't know if this falls
under that category...

205
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,658
...but, uh, Ross is right back there.

206
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,452
- That's not Ross.
- Oh, no, not that guy.

207
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,579
He does look like him, though.

208
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,916
Okay. Ross is in the bathroom.

209
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:59,128
Oh, my God. It's happening.
It's already started. I'm Kip.

210
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,548
- What?
- Yeah, you're not Kip.

211
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,216
Do you even know who Kip is?

212
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,387
Who cares? You're Rachel.

213
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,266
Who's Kip?

214
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,060
Kip, my old roommate.
We all hung out together.

215
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,771
- Oh, that poor bastard.
- Mm-hm.

216
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,525
See? You told me the story.
He and Monica dated.

217
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,944
They broke up,
they couldn't be in the same room.

218
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,946
You all promised you'd stay his friend.

219
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,782
And what happened? He got phased out.

220
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,660
- You're not gonna be phased out.
- Well, of course I am.

221
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:34,706
It won't happen to Ross. He's your
brother, your old college roommate.

222
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,917
It was a matter of time
before someone had to leave the group.

223
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,878
I always assumed Phoebe
would be the one to go.

224
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,466
Honey, come on, you live far away,
you're not related.

225
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,135
You lift right out.

226
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,934
Hey.

227
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,186
Hey, Mr. Bing.

228
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,773
That, uh, hotel you stayed at called.

229
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,235
Said someone left an eyelash curler
in your room.

230
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,823
Yes, that was mine.

231
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,119
I figured you hooked up with some girl
and she left it.

232
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,997
Yes, that would have made more sense.

233
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,043
You know, I don't even feel like
I know you anymore, man.

234
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:24,839
All right, uh, look, I'm just gonna
ask you this one time, all right?

235
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,592
And whatever you say,
I'll believe you.

236
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,471
Were you or were you not...

237
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,097
...on a gay cruise?

238
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,446
Phoebe.

239
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,078
I'm sorry about
the whole lifting-out thing.

240
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,040
You gotta come with me.

241
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,833
- Come where?
- Wherever I go.

242
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,420
Come on, you and me, we'll start
a new group. We're the best ones.

243
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,594
Okay, but try to get Joey too.

244
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,767
Pheebs, do you mind
if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?

245
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,019
Oh, sure, yeah.

246
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,398
Bye, Ross.

247
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,775
Forever.

248
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,238
- Ahem.
- Hi.

249
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,489
Hi.

250
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,617
What are you doing here?
Isn't this against the rules?

251
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,454
I talked to Monica.

252
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,793
Look, I'm the one who made the choice.

253
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,796
I'm the one who's making things change.

254
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,341
So I should be the one to,
you know, step back.

255
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,594
- Oh, Ross...
- No, no, it's okay. Really.

256
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,556
Plenty of people just see
their sisters at Thanksgiving...

257
00:16:56,724 --> 00:17:00,601
...and just see their college roommates
at reunions...

258
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,855
...and just see Joey at Burger King.

259
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,902
So is that better?

260
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,992
No, it's not better.

261
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,037
I still don't get to see you.

262
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:25,293
Well, what would you do, Rach?
If you were me, what would you do?

263
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,384
Well...

264
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:37,138
...for starters, I would have said
the right name at my wedding.

265
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,147
I can't believe this is happening.

266
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,611
I know.

267
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,906
I am so sorry.

268
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,326
I know that too.

269
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,418
Ahem. Hey, Rach?

270
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:12,048
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, Phoebe said
you wanted to talk to me about a trip.

271
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,723
- Hey.
- Hi.

272
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,601
I just came over to drop off...

273
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,520
...nothing.

274
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,109
So that weekend kind of sucked, huh?

275
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,111
Yeah, it did.

276
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,905
So I guess this is over?

277
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,867
- What?
- Well, you know, you and me.

278
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,744
I mean, it had to end sometime.

279
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,247
Why exactly?

280
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,833
Because of the weekend. We had a fight.

281
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,502
Chandler, that's crazy.

282
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,089
Ha, ha. If you give up every time
you have a fight with someone...

283
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,050
...you'd never be with anyone
longer than...

284
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,512
Oh.

285
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,517
So this isn't over?

286
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,563
You are so cute!

287
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,651
No, no. It was a fight.

288
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:18,156
You deal with it and you move on.
It's nothing to freak out about.

289
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,826
- Really? Okay, great.
- Heh.

290
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,996
Aw. Welcome to an adult relationship.

291
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,251
We're in a relationship?

292
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,507
- I'm afraid so.
- Okay.

293
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,598
- Hey.
- Hey.

294
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:47,143
Oh, hey, Monica, I heard you saw
Donald Trump at your convention.

295
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,395
Yeah, saw him waiting for an elevator.

296
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,234
Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler?
I lost mine.

297
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,361
Yeah, it's in the bathroom.

298
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,951
Oh! Oh!

299
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,120
- Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
- Ooh, oh!

300
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,873
- Joey, I need to talk to you.
- Oh! Oh!

301
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,000
Oh, oh, oh!

302
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:23,221
Yes.

303
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,183
You? And you?

304
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,353
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone.
No one knows.

305
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,355
But how? When?

306
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,233
- It happened in London.
- In London!

307
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:41,697
The reason we didn't tell anyone was
we didn't wanna make a big deal out of it.

308
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:45,576
But it is a big deal!
I have to tell someone!

309
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,287
No, no, no. You can't.

310
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,624
Please, please. We just don't wanna
deal with telling everyone.

311
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,126
Please, just promise you won't tell.

312
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,840
All right.

313
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,344
Man, this is unbelievable!

314
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,514
I mean, it's great! But...

315
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,059
- I know. It's great! Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

316
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,937
Oh, I don't wanna see that!

317
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,109
We're so stupid.

318
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:21,696
Do you know what's going on in there?
They're trying to take Joey.

319
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:32,331
"The most popular Phoebe in tennis
is called the overhand Phoebe. Heh.

320
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:35,876
If you win, you must slap your opponent
on the Phoebe and say, 'Hi, Phoebe!"'

321
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,881
Oh, that's cute.
We really all enjoyed it.

322
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,134
- But you know it doesn't count.
- For what?

323
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:47,346
Just count in our heads as good Mad Libs.

324
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,349
- I guess fun time's over.
- Yeah, I'm done.

325
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,977
Wait, guys, if we follow the rules...

326
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,521
...it's still fun and it means something.

327
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,023
I'm gonna take off.

328
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,442
Guys, rules are good!

329
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,402
Rules help control the fun.

330
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,322
Oh!
