1
00:00:08,287 --> 00:00:10,915
Monica, that was the best
Thanksgiving dinner ever.

2
00:00:11,123 --> 00:00:13,683
lt was so good.
l think you killed us.

3
00:00:15,494 --> 00:00:17,758
l couldn't possibly eat another bite.

4
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,155
l need something sweet.

5
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:23,191
Does anyone want to watch TV?

6
00:00:27,205 --> 00:00:29,264
Monica, your remote doesn't work.

7
00:00:29,508 --> 00:00:32,033
You have to lift it and point.

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,613
Oh, forget it.

9
00:00:38,517 --> 00:00:43,147
Let's play that game where everyone
says one thing they're thankful for.

10
00:00:44,323 --> 00:00:48,123
l am thankful for this
beautiful fall we've been having.

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,884
Very nice.

12
00:00:50,362 --> 00:00:52,330
The other day,
l was at the bus stop...

13
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:57,059
...and this lovely fall breeze came
and blew this chick's skirt up.

14
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:02,906
Which reminds me,
l'm also thankful for thongs.

15
00:01:04,977 --> 00:01:06,740
The One with the Thanksgiving Flashbacks

16
00:01:52,624 --> 00:01:55,821
lt's not so much an underpant
as a feat of engineering.

17
00:01:57,462 --> 00:01:58,486
lt's amazing...

18
00:01:58,697 --> 00:02:01,928
...how much they can do
with so little material.

19
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:06,331
And they play with your mind.
ls it there? ls it not there?

20
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:10,001
Are you aware that
you're still talking?

21
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,638
ls anyone thankful for anything else
besides a thong?

22
00:02:15,213 --> 00:02:19,377
l don't know. Am l more thankful
for my divorce or my eviction?

23
00:02:19,685 --> 00:02:22,882
And l didn't think you'd be able
to come up with anything.

24
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,282
l'm sorry. This is
the worst Thanksgiving ever.

25
00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:30,688
l am the king of bad Thanksgivings.

26
00:02:30,962 --> 00:02:35,023
You can't swoop in with your bad
marriage and take that away from me.

27
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:39,231
You're not going to tell about your
parents' divorce again, are you?

28
00:02:41,206 --> 00:02:43,174
Come on! l want to hear it.

29
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,571
lt wouldn't be Thanksgiving
without Chandler bumming us out.

30
00:02:49,748 --> 00:02:51,648
lt's a tradition, like the parade.

31
00:02:51,883 --> 00:02:56,343
lf the parade decided it was gay
and abandoned its family.

32
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:00,688
Now, Chandler, dear...

33
00:03:00,926 --> 00:03:03,087
...just because
we're getting a divorce...

34
00:03:03,328 --> 00:03:05,057
...doesn't mean we don't love you.

35
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:06,755
lt just means...

36
00:03:06,998 --> 00:03:10,490
...he would rather sleep
with the houseboy than with me.

37
00:03:13,405 --> 00:03:15,498
More turkey, Mr. Chandler?

38
00:03:19,544 --> 00:03:23,446
Every time you tell that story,
that guy's accent gets thicker and thicker.

39
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,409
So are he and your dad still together?

40
00:03:27,586 --> 00:03:31,682
No. After they got their own place,
the houseboy got his own houseboy.

41
00:03:31,923 --> 00:03:34,221
Should have heard his accent.

42
00:03:34,726 --> 00:03:38,719
You're right, yours is worse.
You're the king of bad Thanksgivings.

43
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:41,127
l've got one that's worse.

44
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,666
Really? Worse than,
''More turkey, Mr. Chandler?''

45
00:03:46,905 --> 00:03:49,305
Did the little rich boy
have a problem with the butler?

46
00:03:49,508 --> 00:03:51,339
Yes, mine's worse!

47
00:03:57,048 --> 00:03:58,345
More bandages!

48
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,517
More bandages!

49
00:04:00,752 --> 00:04:03,414
Please, can l get
some more bandages in here?

50
00:04:03,688 --> 00:04:05,519
This man is--

51
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:16,826
ln this life, Phoebe.

52
00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:19,268
Oh, this life. Oh, okay.

53
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:20,766
No, Chandler's is worse.

54
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:25,165
lt must be cool
remembering stuff like that.

55
00:04:25,377 --> 00:04:27,845
l don't have any past-life memories.

56
00:04:28,446 --> 00:04:31,574
Of course, you don't, sweetie.
You're brand-new.

57
00:04:33,752 --> 00:04:35,743
l know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.

58
00:04:36,254 --> 00:04:38,518
Let's not tell this story.

59
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,114
l know!

60
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:44,192
lt's the one where Joey got
Monica's turkey stuck on his head.

61
00:04:46,464 --> 00:04:49,297
Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?

62
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:50,899
lt's not like it sounds.

63
00:04:51,136 --> 00:04:53,195
lt's exactly like it sounds.

64
00:05:10,455 --> 00:05:12,252
What's going on?

65
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,654
Oh, my God!

66
00:05:16,928 --> 00:05:18,122
l know!

67
00:05:18,597 --> 00:05:20,155
lt's stuck!

68
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:22,722
Step.

69
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:24,492
How did it get on?

70
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:27,227
l put it on to scare Chandler.

71
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:31,108
Oh, my God! Monica's going to
totally freak out!

72
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:32,742
Help me get it off!

73
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:35,742
Plus, it smells really bad in here.

74
00:05:37,115 --> 00:05:41,279
Of course it smells bad.
You have your head up a dead animal's ass.

75
00:05:51,463 --> 00:05:53,294
Did you get the turkey--?

76
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:55,090
Oh, my God!

77
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,322
Who is that?

78
00:05:57,002 --> 00:05:58,765
lt's Joey.

79
00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:02,102
ls this supposed to be funny?

80
00:06:02,307 --> 00:06:05,401
lt's not supposed to be funny.
lt's supposed to be scary.

81
00:06:06,811 --> 00:06:07,903
Get that off now!

82
00:06:08,146 --> 00:06:10,114
l can't. lt's stuck!

83
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:14,945
lt has to feed 20 people. They're
not going to eat it off your head!

84
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:16,476
Hold on.

85
00:06:16,688 --> 00:06:18,781
Let's just all think.

86
00:06:24,362 --> 00:06:25,420
l got it!

87
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:27,587
You pull.

88
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:30,859
l'll spread the legs
as wide as l can.

89
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:35,829
Now is not the time.

90
00:06:36,975 --> 00:06:38,772
Count to three. One...

91
00:06:38,944 --> 00:06:39,968
...two...

92
00:06:40,145 --> 00:06:41,271
...three!

93
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:47,784
lt worked!
l scared you! l knew it!

94
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:51,380
l'm here, big guy.

95
00:06:51,656 --> 00:06:53,146
Yeah, you are!

96
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:55,492
l scared you!

97
00:06:59,064 --> 00:07:01,362
You did look like an idiot.

98
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:05,128
l wasn't the only one
who looked like an idiot.

99
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,703
Remember when Ross tried to say
''butternut squash'' ...

100
00:07:08,907 --> 00:07:12,070
...and it came out,
''squatternut bosh''?

101
00:07:14,512 --> 00:07:16,309
Yeah, that's the same.

102
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,312
That's it.
That's my worst Thanksgiving.

103
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,578
That can't be the one Rachel meant.

104
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:25,881
She didn't even know that happened.

105
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:27,653
So, what's yours?

106
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:30,927
l really don't want
to tell this story.

107
00:07:31,162 --> 00:07:35,895
Reliving pain and getting depressed
is what Thanksgiving's all about.

108
00:07:37,502 --> 00:07:38,696
For me, anyway.

109
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:41,736
And, of course, the lndians.

110
00:07:42,007 --> 00:07:44,874
Of all people, you do not want me
to tell this story.

111
00:07:45,076 --> 00:07:46,839
What is that supposed to mean?

112
00:07:48,713 --> 00:07:51,546
-Monica, l think Rachel's here!
-l'll get it!

113
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,748
Happy Thanksgiving!

114
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,516
Not for me.

115
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,058
Chip and l broke up.

116
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:05,620
Why?

117
00:08:05,897 --> 00:08:07,125
What happened?

118
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:10,562
My parents are out of town,
and Chip was going to come over.

119
00:08:11,136 --> 00:08:13,229
And you were going to give him...

120
00:08:13,471 --> 00:08:14,733
...your ''flower.''

121
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,805
Monica, can you just call it sex?

122
00:08:18,109 --> 00:08:21,135
lt really creeps me out
when you call it that.

123
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:22,539
And by the way...

124
00:08:22,781 --> 00:08:26,649
...while we're at it, a guy's thing
is not called his ''tenderness.''

125
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:31,382
Believe me.

126
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:36,921
Happy Thanksgiving.

127
00:08:44,469 --> 00:08:45,458
Everyone...

128
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,729
...this is Chandler.

129
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:48,963
My roommate...

130
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:51,836
...and lead singer of our band.

131
00:08:55,814 --> 00:08:57,111
This is Monica.

132
00:08:57,816 --> 00:08:59,579
l'm Ross' little sister.

133
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:06,023
l'm so glad you could come.

134
00:09:06,324 --> 00:09:08,588
We've got plenty of food,
so l hope you're hungry.

135
00:09:08,793 --> 00:09:13,594
Chandler hates Thanksgiving
and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.

136
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:16,633
l'm so glad you brought him here.

137
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:22,270
l can make you some
macaroni and cheese for dinner.

138
00:09:22,507 --> 00:09:24,372
As long as the Pilgrims
didn't eat it.

139
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:29,975
Damn it!

140
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:43,218
Does it feel weird around here now?

141
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:46,658
You know, since
l've been away at college?

142
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,959
Not really.

143
00:09:50,068 --> 00:09:51,660
That's cool.

144
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:00,738
So that's Rachel, the girl you've been
writing all those songs about?

145
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:05,906
Might want to rethink the lyrics to
''She Feels Weird Since l've Been Gone.''

146
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:14,323
l cannot believe Chip dumped me
for that slut Nancy Branson!

147
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:18,792
l am never going out with him again.
l don't care how much he begs.

148
00:10:18,997 --> 00:10:22,023
His begging days are over, now
that he's with Nancy Branson.

149
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:26,900
l've just had it
with high-school boys.

150
00:10:27,105 --> 00:10:28,538
They're just silly.

151
00:10:28,773 --> 00:10:32,004
They're just silly, stupid boys.

152
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,609
l'll start dating men.

153
00:10:36,114 --> 00:10:37,103
l'm sorry, Judy.

154
00:10:37,315 --> 00:10:40,944
l couldn't find that bowl
you and Jack were looking for.

155
00:10:43,454 --> 00:10:45,820
Call them Mom and Dad, you loser.

156
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:01,396
Did you like
the macaroni and cheese?

157
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,630
lt was great.
You should be a chef.

158
00:11:09,914 --> 00:11:11,074
Guess what.

159
00:11:11,349 --> 00:11:14,512
All this stuff about Nancy
being a slut was all a rumor.

160
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:18,052
Chip dumped her, and he wants
to come over to my house!

161
00:11:18,256 --> 00:11:20,486
-That is so great!
-l know.

162
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:24,252
Oh, gosh. Listen,
if you and Chip do it tonight...

163
00:11:24,495 --> 00:11:26,554
...promise me
you'll tell me everything.

164
00:11:26,764 --> 00:11:30,598
Totally. lt's not that big a deal.
We already kind of did it once.

165
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:34,100
But now you'll definitely know
whether or not you did it.

166
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:35,498
l know.

167
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:40,740
And Chip promised that this time
it'd last at least for an entire song.

168
00:11:43,448 --> 00:11:45,541
l'm thinking of asking
Rachel out tonight...

169
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:48,411
...maybe playing her that song
we wrote last week.

170
00:11:48,686 --> 00:11:50,950
''Emotional Knapsack''?
Right on!

171
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:56,887
But don't take long.
We're testing our fake lD's tonight.

172
00:11:57,128 --> 00:11:58,959
Right, Clifford Alvarez?

173
00:12:00,765 --> 00:12:03,063
Listen, Roland Cheng...

174
00:12:04,469 --> 00:12:07,529
...if things go well,
l may be out with her all night.

175
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:09,935
Dude, don't do that to me.

176
00:12:10,141 --> 00:12:12,609
lt's cool, you can stay here.
My parents won't mind.

177
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:16,769
lt's not that. l just don't want
to be stuck here with your fat sister.

178
00:12:20,785 --> 00:12:22,810
Why don't you finish off these pies?

179
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:25,317
l don't have any more room
in the fridge.

180
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,249
No, thank you.

181
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:32,891
Judy, you did it.

182
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:35,065
She's finally full!

183
00:12:38,603 --> 00:12:40,070
l called you fat?

184
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:42,501
-l don't even remember that.
-Maybe it'd jog your memory...

185
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:46,007
...if you guys played
a little bit of ''Emotional Knapsack.''

186
00:12:47,512 --> 00:12:49,309
l'm so sorry. l really am.

187
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:50,878
l was an idiot back then.

188
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:53,947
l rushed the stage at a Wham concert,
for crying out loud!

189
00:12:56,387 --> 00:12:58,116
l can't believe you called her fat.

190
00:12:58,323 --> 00:13:01,292
l can't believe you let
George Michael slap you.

191
00:13:03,227 --> 00:13:04,285
l am really sorry.

192
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:07,396
That is terrible. l'm so sorry.

193
00:13:07,965 --> 00:13:10,695
That's not the Thanksgiving
l was talking about.

194
00:13:10,868 --> 00:13:11,857
Yes, it was.

195
00:13:12,036 --> 00:13:13,560
No, it was actually--

196
00:13:13,838 --> 00:13:17,001
Thanksgiving's over.
Let's get ready for Christmas.

197
00:13:19,243 --> 00:13:21,575
l have the cutest Christmas story.

198
00:13:21,846 --> 00:13:23,643
We want to hear Monica's story.

199
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:27,977
Mine had a dwarf that got broke in half,
but, you know, whatever.

200
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:32,889
You changed your major again?

201
00:13:33,391 --> 00:13:34,380
l had to.

202
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:37,755
There was never any parking
by the psychology building.

203
00:13:40,765 --> 00:13:43,097
Love your new nose!

204
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:45,928
Dr. Wolfson's an artist.

205
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,535
He removed my mole cluster.

206
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,067
Want to see?

207
00:13:50,575 --> 00:13:52,202
No! Please, let me.

208
00:14:01,252 --> 00:14:03,015
Happy Thanksgiving.

209
00:14:04,222 --> 00:14:06,053
Your hair sure is different.

210
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:08,020
We were just talking about that.

211
00:14:08,226 --> 00:14:10,717
We can't believe
how stupid we used to look.

212
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:15,755
Where's Monica?

213
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:17,591
She's upstairs.

214
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:19,531
Come down, everyone's here!

215
00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:20,760
Ross, Rachel...

216
00:14:21,038 --> 00:14:23,632
...and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.

217
00:14:29,113 --> 00:14:30,603
Oh, my God!

218
00:14:31,315 --> 00:14:32,907
What's the matter?

219
00:14:33,117 --> 00:14:35,551
ls there something on my dress?

220
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:39,222
You look so different.

221
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,379
Terrific.

222
00:14:40,558 --> 00:14:42,185
That dress, that body....

223
00:14:42,393 --> 00:14:43,621
-Dude!
-Sorry.

224
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,564
Yes, she's thin. lt's wonderful.

225
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,391
But we really want to hear...

226
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,795
...about Ross' new girlfriend.

227
00:14:54,672 --> 00:14:55,900
Her name is Carol.

228
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,108
She's really pretty and smart.

229
00:14:58,342 --> 00:15:01,402
She's on the lacrosse team
and the golf team.

230
00:15:01,612 --> 00:15:03,136
Can you believe it?

231
00:15:03,347 --> 00:15:05,474
She plays for both teams.

232
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:10,787
So l guess l'll see you at dinner.

233
00:15:12,757 --> 00:15:13,746
-Dude!
-Sorry.

234
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:16,851
Oh, my God!

235
00:15:17,128 --> 00:15:18,755
That was so awesome.

236
00:15:18,963 --> 00:15:20,988
You got him back
for calling you fat.

237
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,962
He was drooling all over you.

238
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:25,761
-That must have felt so great.
-lt didn't.

239
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:29,831
Yeah, l mean, l look great.

240
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:33,772
l feel great, and my heart's
not in trouble anymore.

241
00:15:35,313 --> 00:15:37,804
l just don't feel
like l got him back.

242
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:40,017
l just want to humiliate him.

243
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:44,448
l want him to be naked, and
l want to point at him and laugh.

244
00:15:46,324 --> 00:15:49,054
That, we may be able to do.

245
00:15:50,194 --> 00:15:51,183
How?

246
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:55,195
Guys tend to get naked
before they're going to have sex.

247
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:56,355
What?

248
00:15:56,534 --> 00:15:58,968
l didn't work this hard
and lose weight...

249
00:15:59,237 --> 00:16:02,536
...just so l could give my flower
to someone like him.

250
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,671
First of all, if you keep calling it that,
no one will take it.

251
00:16:06,811 --> 00:16:10,406
And then second of all,
you're not going to have sex with him.

252
00:16:10,715 --> 00:16:13,013
You'll just make him
think that you are.

253
00:16:16,153 --> 00:16:19,213
l'll throw him out
in the yard, lock the door...

254
00:16:19,423 --> 00:16:22,221
...and all our neighbors
will just humiliate him!

255
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,751
You'll definitely get him back.

256
00:16:24,996 --> 00:16:27,089
How do l make him think
l want to have sex?

257
00:16:27,598 --> 00:16:29,259
Here's what you do.

258
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:33,527
Just act like everything around you
turns you on.

259
00:16:36,507 --> 00:16:37,735
What do you mean?

260
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:39,407
Anything can be sexy.

261
00:16:41,445 --> 00:16:43,106
Like this dish towel.

262
00:16:46,884 --> 00:16:50,081
This feels so good against my cheek.

263
00:16:50,354 --> 00:16:54,051
And if l get a little hot,
l can just dab myself with it.

264
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:58,586
Or l can bring it down to my side
and run it through my fingers...

265
00:16:58,796 --> 00:17:00,229
...while l talk to him.

266
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:01,587
l can do that.

267
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:03,227
Good, good, good.

268
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:05,128
Get busy. He's coming.

269
00:17:06,203 --> 00:17:07,568
Hey, what's up?

270
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:14,477
Could you make me some of that
righteous mac and cheese like last year?

271
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,268
l'd love to.

272
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:26,118
l love macaroni and cheese.

273
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:31,625
l love the way this box feels
against my cheek.

274
00:17:39,103 --> 00:17:41,003
And l love carrots.

275
00:17:44,842 --> 00:17:47,811
Sometimes l like to put them
between my fingers.

276
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,270
Like this.

277
00:17:51,515 --> 00:17:54,109
And hold them down here
while l talk to you.

278
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,752
And, you know, if l get really hot...

279
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,629
...l like to pick up this knife.

280
00:18:07,765 --> 00:18:10,996
And l put the cool steel...

281
00:18:11,268 --> 00:18:12,496
...against...

282
00:18:13,704 --> 00:18:15,331
...my body.

283
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,501
Are you all right?

284
00:18:19,944 --> 00:18:20,933
l'm fine.

285
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,850
Twenty-year-old male.

286
00:18:38,062 --> 00:18:40,530
He's got a severed toe
on his right foot.

287
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:45,226
Could you please not
do that feet first?

288
00:18:45,503 --> 00:18:48,870
You know where his injury is.
Severed toe, you just said it!

289
00:18:50,508 --> 00:18:52,874
lt says the knife went
through your shoe.

290
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:54,408
They're made of wicker!

291
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,711
Did you bring the toe?

292
00:18:57,915 --> 00:18:59,143
l have it right here on ice.

293
00:18:59,316 --> 00:19:01,546
<i>Toes on Ice</i>, coming soon
to Madison Square Garden.

294
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:03,949
Save your strength, man.

295
00:19:04,355 --> 00:19:07,153
Don't worry, son.
We'll just reattach it and then....

296
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:08,947
What is it?

297
00:19:09,326 --> 00:19:10,759
You brought a carrot.

298
00:19:13,864 --> 00:19:17,925
This isn't your toe. This is a small,
very cold piece of carrot.

299
00:19:18,202 --> 00:19:20,193
You brought a carrot?

300
00:19:20,471 --> 00:19:21,995
Oh, my God!

301
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:24,432
There's a toe in my kitchen.

302
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,171
l'm sorry! l'll go get it!

303
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:30,347
All we can do now
is sew up the wound.

304
00:19:30,548 --> 00:19:32,846
Without my toe? l need my toe!

305
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,383
l can go really fast!
Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche.

306
00:19:36,654 --> 00:19:38,849
l'm not falling for that one.

307
00:19:40,491 --> 00:19:43,392
That's why l lost my toe?
Because l called you fat?

308
00:19:45,663 --> 00:19:48,131
l didn't mean to cut it off.
lt was an accident.

309
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:51,994
That's why for an entire year
people called me Sir Limps-a-lot?

310
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,694
l'm sorry.

311
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,173
lt wasn't your whole toe.

312
00:19:57,374 --> 00:19:59,308
Yeah, well, l miss the tip.

313
00:19:59,643 --> 00:20:00,837
lt's the best part.

314
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:03,675
lt has the nail.

315
00:20:09,186 --> 00:20:10,346
Sir Limps-a-lot.

316
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:12,419
l came up with that.

317
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:16,592
You're a dork.

318
00:20:18,162 --> 00:20:21,325
-l can't believe this.
-l said l was sorry.

319
00:20:21,565 --> 00:20:24,693
''Sorry'' doesn't bring back the piggy
that cried all the way home.

320
00:20:26,904 --> 00:20:29,065
lt figures that something like this
would happen today.

321
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,300
l hate this stupid day
and everything about it!

322
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,499
l'll see you later.

323
00:20:33,744 --> 00:20:34,733
Wait.

324
00:20:34,912 --> 00:20:36,311
Come here.

325
00:20:36,514 --> 00:20:39,347
ls there anything l can do?
Anything?

326
00:20:40,017 --> 00:20:42,986
Just leave me alone for a little while.

327
00:20:49,326 --> 00:20:51,055
l'm a duck.
l go quack-quack.

328
00:20:51,262 --> 00:20:53,321
l'm happy all the time.

329
00:21:04,575 --> 00:21:05,701
Nice try.

330
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,537
Wait, wait, wait.

331
00:21:10,748 --> 00:21:11,908
Look, Monica--

332
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,887
This is not going to work.

333
00:21:18,088 --> 00:21:19,783
l bet this will work.

334
00:21:28,232 --> 00:21:29,221
You're so great.

335
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,867
l love you.

336
00:21:42,146 --> 00:21:46,082
Nothing. l said you're so great,
and then l just stopped talking.

337
00:21:47,751 --> 00:21:50,049
You said you loved me.
l can't believe this!

338
00:21:50,254 --> 00:21:51,312
No, l didn't!

339
00:21:53,123 --> 00:21:54,147
Yes, you did!

340
00:21:54,391 --> 00:21:55,551
No, l didn't!

341
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,984
You love me!

342
00:21:58,229 --> 00:21:59,218
No, l don't!

343
00:21:59,496 --> 00:22:01,157
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

344
00:22:13,477 --> 00:22:14,671
Gauze!

345
00:22:15,012 --> 00:22:16,001
Gauze!

346
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,341
l need to get some gauze in here!

347
00:22:18,616 --> 00:22:22,074
Can l please get some more gauze?

348
00:22:32,162 --> 00:22:33,424
This is getting ridiculous.
