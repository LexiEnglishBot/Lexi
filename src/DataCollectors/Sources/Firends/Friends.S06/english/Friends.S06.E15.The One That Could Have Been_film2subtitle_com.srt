Barry was the guy I almost married,
and Mindy was my best friend.

00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,437
Wait! You didn't sit on my
Kit Kats did you?

164
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:28,066
No, there was a little,
little dip in the market...

165
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,277
...and I lost $13 million.

166
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,571
But the Kit Kats are all right?

167
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,366
What am I gonna do?
I can't call my office, they'll kill me.

168
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:39,703
I can't call my clients,
they'll kill themselves!

169
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,455
- All right, now my chest hurts.
- What?

170
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,166
My chest hurts. Ugh.

171
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:50,005
- Ugh! And now, I can't breathe.
- Are you having a heart attack?

172
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,842
If I were, would I have shooting
pains up and down my left arm?

173
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,970
- Yes.
- Then, yes. That is what I'm having.

174
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,847
Oh, my God!

175
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,646
Come on, Pheebs, it's not that bad.

176
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:10,066
Most people'd be excited if they
didn't work for a couple weeks.

177
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:13,278
Most people don't like their jobs.
I love my job.

178
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:17,616
I've been not working for three hours,
and I'm already going crazy.

179
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,409
I miss Joan.

180
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:24,331
Honey, a heart attack is nature's
way of telling you to slow down.

181
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:28,418
I always thought it was nature's way
of telling you to die. Heh.

182
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,421
You're not gonna die.

183
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:35,967
I mean, you are going to die,
but you're not gonna die today.

184
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,427
I wish I was dead.

185
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,347
Let's take a walk.

186
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:44,309
You should consider writing for
Talking Out of Your Ass magazine.

187
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,564
So what's going on with you?

188
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:54,944
Well, um, I've been doing a lot more
of my karate.

189
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,907
- Still a dry spell with Carol?
- Yeah.

190
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,618
How long has it been since
you've had sex?

191
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,913
- Well, last weekend...
- That's not so bad.

192
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,874
...will be two months...

193
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,002
...since I stopped trying.

194
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,005
You need to spice things up.

195
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,715
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

196
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:19,219
You could tie her up.
You could eat stuff off each other.

197
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,512
Oh.

198
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,349
- Dirty talk, ménage à trois, toys.
- Wow.

199
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,727
Role-playing.
You're warden, she's prisoner.

200
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:31,481
- You're the pirate, she's the wench.
- Okay, I think I got it.

201
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,527
You could be two stockbrokers,
rolling naked on the trading floor...

202
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,779
...and everybody's watching.

203
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,157
It never happened.

204
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,957
And over there is Brady's Pub...

205
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,127
...where I unwind
after a long day of "surgeoning."

206
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,046
Wow! This is so amazing. What else?

207
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,341
Well, that is a large piece
of television equipment.

208
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,260
And, uh, that is an old man.

209
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,095
- Hey, old man!
- Hey.

210
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,557
Alrighty. What do you say we head
back to my place?

211
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:11,312
Well, wow. Um, you know,
I would really love to, but I shouldn't.

212
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,817
Why?
Why can't the world stop turning?

213
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,029
Just for a moment. Just for us.

214
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,324
Isn't that a line from the show?

215
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,579
Uh, yeah, but, uh...

216
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,749
...I may have said
those things before, but...

217
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:35,211
...I never truly meant them until now.

218
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,298
That's a line from the show too!

219
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,092
Okay, you watch too much TV.

220
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,679
Joe, here's the freshly-squeezed
orange juice you asked for.

221
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,055
- Thanks.
- Hi.

222
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,558
Yeah, there's pulp in that.

223
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,854
- Yeah?
- Heh.

224
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,649
I thought we talked about this.
I don't like pulp.

225
00:12:56,817 --> 00:13:00,278
No pulp. Pulp isn't juice.
All juice. Okay?

226
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,573
I'm sorry. I guess I just like the pulp.

227
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,285
God, I'm sorry. I am being so rude.

228
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,121
Rachel, would you like a soda
or something?

229
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:14,167
Because Chandler will
run right out and get it.

230
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,295
Yeah, well, sure,
iced tea would be great.

231
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,755
Iced tea.

232
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,302
Okay. Anything for you, sir?

233
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,971
Did I not just tell him?

234
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,392
Okay, look, Chandler,
if this is gonna work...

235
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,396
...you have got to listen.

236
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,152
You're gonna throw that juice at me,
aren't you?

237
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,654
It's not all juice.

238
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,620
Honey, this morning was fun, huh?

239
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:54,457
Me hopping in on you
in the shower there?

240
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,336
Yeah, maybe someday we could get
a place with two bathrooms.

241
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,510
Look, Carol, um, I was thinking maybe...

242
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:08,596
...maybe we can spice things
up a little.

243
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,100
- What do you mean?
- Carol, our sex life. It's just not...

244
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,854
- Dad!
- Hey there, little fella!

245
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,981
Hey, why don't we get
some shoes on you?

246
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:21,276
Show Dad how you
put your shoes on in your room.

247
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,444
- Yay!
- Yay!

248
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,113
Yay!

249
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,824
Seriously, our sex life.

250
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,160
I was thinking maybe, I don't know...

251
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,205
...we could try some new things,
you know, for fun.

252
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:38,042
- Like what?
- Well, I don't know. Um...

253
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,213
What if we, uh, were to...

254
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,133
...tie each other up?

255
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,845
[COUGHS]

256
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:56,728
Um, some people eat stuff
off one another.

257
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,981
Yeah.

258
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:04,402
Um, you know, we could try dirty talk.
Uh, heh.

259
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:09,949
- Um, we could have a threesome.
- I love that idea!

260
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,079
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?

261
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,583
Oh, my God, that's so great.
Oh, wow!

262
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,086
You're a published writer.
I wish I had a present.

263
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,963
- Aw.
- Wait a minute.

264
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,509
My last Kit Kat bar.

265
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,391
- You want to share it?
- Okay!

266
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,978
- Hey.
- Hey.

267
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,898
Chandler, I know you're mad.
I'm sorry.

268
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:46,653
I was a total jerk.
Completely over the line.

269
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,905
I just... I hate pulp.

270
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,034
You know how Monica feels
about low-fat mayonnaise?

271
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,495
It's not mayonnaise!

272
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:01,668
Okay, uh, anyway, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, and here.

273
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,672
- What's this?
- Fresh-squeezed orange juice, with pulp.

274
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,384
- Just the way you like.
- Aw, thanks, man.

275
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,099
Hey, Joey? Chandler sold a story
to Archie Comics.

276
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,519
Oh, my God, that's great! Congratulations!
What's the story?

277
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:23,022
Oh, you wouldn't care.
It's just a stupid comic book story.

278
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,776
Are you kidding me?
I love Archie and the whole gang.

279
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:33,574
Well, um, Archie needs money
to fix his jalopy.

280
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,790
Uh, but he doesn't want Reggie
to just give him the money.

281
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,668
So Reggie hires him as his assist...

282
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,755
As his butler.

283
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,174
And makes him do crazy things...

284
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,803
...like bring him milk shakes
that can't have lumps.

285
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,100
Wait a minute.
That sounds a little familiar.

286
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,604
Did they already do that?
I think I read it!

287
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,611
Monica, listen. I have to ask.

288
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:15,074
Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back
to his apartment.

289
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:20,288
- Does he do this with a lot of girls?
- Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot.

290
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,123
Ah! And I'm one of them.

291
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,751
Wow.

292
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:29,464
I just cannot believe this.
I mean, Joey Tribbiani.

293
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,091
It's none of my business,
but aren't you married?

294
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,634
Yeah.

295
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,098
I wish we could just not be married
for a little bit.

296
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:43,227
You know, I just wish we could be,
like, on a break.

297
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,107
Well, you're not.

298
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,819
It's easy for you. You get to
have sex with whoever you want.

299
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,654
Yeah, I can. Ha.

300
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,616
Don't think I don't. I do.

301
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,868
I mean, all the time. You bet!

302
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,247
- Monica?
- Hmm?

303
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,542
You've done it, right?

304
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,336
[LAUGHS]

305
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:13,466
Of course I have. What do you think,
I'm like some 30-year-old virgin?

306
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,053
Oh, my God.
You're a 30-year-old virgin.

307
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,516
Louder. I don't think
the guy in the back heard.

308
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,476
GUY:
Yeah, I heard it.

309
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,689
It's not like I haven't had
the opportunity.

310
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,983
- I'm waiting for the perfect guy.
- Mm-hm.

311
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,861
I'm seeing this guy Roger.
He's not perfect...

312
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,656
...but, uh, I'm thinking maybe
I should get it over with.

313
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,908
You know, give him my flower.

314
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:46,374
Oh, my God, do it!
Honey, you've waited long enough.

315
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:51,212
- You know what? You are right.
- Sex does not have to be a big deal.

316
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,340
There shouldn't be all these
rules and restrictions.

317
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,677
People should be able to sleep
with whoever, whenever...

318
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:01,556
Rachel. I'm never gonna think it's okay
for you to cheat on your husband.

319
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,516
Oh, what do you know, virgin?

320
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,232
Phoebe?

321
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,443
Why is smoke coming out
of the bathroom?

322
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:18,406
PHOEBE: Oh, yeah. The doctor said
that could be one of the side effects.

323
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,284
Put the cigarette out.

324
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:25,538
PHOEBE: No, it's not a cigarette.
The smoke is coming out of me!

325
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,749
- Put it out.
PHOEBE: Okay, okay!

326
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:34,130
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Come on.
