1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,378
Hey.

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:07,214
- What's the matter?
- Someone on the subway licked my neck!

3
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:11,176
- Licked my neck!
- Whoa! Willy's still alive.

4
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,929
- What are you doing?
- My mom called.

5
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,807
They're gonna run our engagement
announcement in the paper.

6
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:21,061
- We're looking for a good picture.
- Ooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.

7
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,814
Not true. There are great pictures of us.

8
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:28,152
No, there are great pictures of you
next to a guy who's going like this...

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,157
Oh, my God, that's the creep that
you're with at the Statue of Liberty.

10
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,078
I don't know what it is.
I just can't take a good picture.

11
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,788
Oh, here's a great one.

12
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:44,418
- Yeah, I'm not in that.
- No, but look at me, all tan.

13
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:48,088
Why don't you get portraits done
by a professional photographer?

14
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:51,550
That's a great idea. I bet they have
one of those wind machines, like:

15
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,473
Yeah, that's great. Next to that,
Chandler won't look so stupid.

16
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,394
- Chandler, what do you say?
- All right, but I should warn you.

17
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,314
I'm not going. I'm going.

18
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,021
Dude, that reverse lay-up. Ugh!

19
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,482
- And how about those three-pointers?
- Amazing.

20
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,611
And those guys were this close
to letting us play this time too.

21
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,202
Hey, look. Phoebe's talking
to Cute Coffeehouse Guy.

22
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:05,290
You call him "Cute Coffeehouse Guy"?
We call him "Hums While He Pees."

23
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,877
Yes, and we call Ross
"Lingers in the Bathroom."

24
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,423
Hey, you guys, "Hums While He Pees"
just asked me out.

25
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:18,053
- I thought that guy was married.
- He is, but he's getting divorced.

26
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,013
Ross, maybe you know him.

27
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,518
It's not a club.

28
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:29,022
If this guy's going through a divorce,
is it a good idea to go out with him?

29
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,066
Hey, divorced men are not bad men.

30
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,694
They have that that on the napkins
at the club.

31
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:39,032
- Oh, I gotta get back to work.
- You don't have to be back for a half-hour.

32
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,287
My assistant, Tag, does sit-ups
in the office during lunch. Heh.

33
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:47,040
Ugh, I could just spread him
on a cracker.

34
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,420
If you have a crush on this guy,
why would you hire him?

35
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,506
- You know you can't date him, right?
- Oh, no, I know that.

36
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,676
Although we made a joke
that we spend so much time together...

37
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,720
...he should call me his "work-wife."

38
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:04,141
Soon he'll be able to call you
"that lady he knew that got fired."

39
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:08,020
I'm not gonna get fired,
because I'm not gonna act on it.

40
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,397
You wouldn't mind
if he was dating someone?

41
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:15,277
Why, is he? He is, isn't he?
He's dating that slut in marketing.

42
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,072
Maybe I should open
a divorced men's club.

43
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,742
Dude, that's so sad.

44
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,412
- I could put a basketball court in the back.
- Heh.

45
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,914
Could I play?

46
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,589
Oh, no sit-ups today, Tag?

47
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,426
- I just did them.
- Oh, well, drop and give me 10 more. Heh.

48
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,012
What?

49
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,515
I had a drink with lunch. Did those, um...?

50
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:49,061
- Did those cost reports come in?
- Yeah, I filled them out last night.

51
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,146
Oh, great. Could you make me 4 copies?

52
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,148
- Sure.
- Great, thank you.

53
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,161
Huh.

54
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,250
Ah.

55
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,797
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi. Hi, Melissa. What's up?

56
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:21,051
I'm just about to, um, go out to the store.

57
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,512
Get some stuff to put in my backpack.

58
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,598
You know, like dried fruit and granola,
and stuff like that.

59
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,184
- Um, what's up?
- Is Tag here?

60
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,311
- No. Why?
- Oh, I was gonna talk to him...

61
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,731
...about doing something tonight.
- Really?

62
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,526
You got a little crush
on Tag there, do you?

63
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,570
Well, we've been flirting back and forth...

64
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:44,783
...but I was hoping tonight it would
turn into something a little more than that.

65
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,870
Okay, whoa, whoa. Easy there, Melissa.
This ain't a locker room, okay.

66
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:56,336
But you know, I remember him saying
that he had plans tonight.

67
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,839
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

68
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,758
All right, back to work.

69
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,761
Hey, isn't that Tag's backpack?

70
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,099
Yeah, Melissa, I don't want to be known
as the, uh, office bitch...

71
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,101
...but I will call your supervisor.

72
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,570
Great, that's great, Monica. Great.

73
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,448
Now, Chandler,
you want to give us a smile?

74
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,949
Okay.

75
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,040
- I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
- No, I am.

76
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:36,877
Chandler, I know you can do this.
You have a beautiful smile.

77
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,171
- I do?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:45,135
All right, maybe you don't have to smile.
Let's try something else. Let's try, um...

79
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,888
- Try looking sexy.
- Okay.

80
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,854
Or not.

81
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,362
Hi, Joey, what are you doing here?

82
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:07,240
I got an audition down the street,
and I spilled sauce all over my shirt.

83
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,496
- You got an extra one?
- Yeah, sure. Um...

84
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,582
Here.

85
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,209
Great.

86
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,587
You got anything
that's not Ralph Lauren?

87
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,174
Yeah, I don't think so, Joe.

88
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,886
I guess this'll be fine.

89
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,431
- Listen, uh, what are you doing tonight?
- Nothing. Why?

90
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,059
How would you feel about
taking out my assistant Tag?

91
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,769
- I'll pay.
- Heh.

92
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:40,190
It's gonna take a lot of money for
me to go out on a date with a dude.

93
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,611
I'm not asking you to go on
a date with him.

94
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,739
Really? Because I could kind of
use the money.

95
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,536
Joey, just... He's new in town
and he doesn't have any guy friends.

96
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,747
Take him to a ball game or something.
I'd appreciate it.

97
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,166
- Yeah, okay, no problem.
- Thank you.

98
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,836
- Ooh, hey, doughnuts!
- Uh-huh.

99
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,097
I know. Let's try a look...

100
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,683
...of far-off wonderment.

101
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:20,397
Gaze into our future and think about
our marriage and the days to come.

102
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:29,364
Chandler, what is the matter
with your face?

103
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,534
This picture's supposed to say
"Geller and Bing to be married"...

104
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,829
...not "Local woman
saves drowning moron."

105
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,623
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Hey, don't laugh at him.

106
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,209
He's my drowning moron.

107
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:44,588
- Aw.
- That's it, that's it! Take it, take it!

108
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,511
I like this one.

109
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,515
It seems to say, "I love you
and that's why I have to kill you."

110
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,478
Can't all be bad.

111
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,148
Find the one where you make
your bedroom eyes.

112
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,357
Oh, there it is.

113
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,944
Oh, my God,
those are my bedroom eyes?

114
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,906
Why did you ever sleep with me?

115
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,659
Do you really want to pull
at that thread?

116
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,374
- I'm having a really good time.
- Me too.

117
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,960
Sorry that guy on the subway
licked your neck.

118
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,545
Oh!

119
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,173
No, that's okay. He's a friend.

120
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,509
Uh, I don't mean to be presumptuous...

121
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,803
...but I have tickets to the
ballroom-dancing finals tomorrow.

122
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,680
Yeah, I...

123
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:40,143
Well, I missed the semifinals,
so I think I would just be lost.

124
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:44,356
Heh, I know that it's lame,
but I got these tickets from my boss...

125
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,192
Oh, no, no, no, my God!

126
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:50,028
- Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
- No, it's...

127
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,780
My ex-wife Whitney is out there.

128
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,950
I cannot deal with her now.
That woman is crazy.

129
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,743
Okay, I know. Hold on.

130
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,162
- Hey, Ross.
- Yeah.

131
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,958
Yeah. Um, that's Whitney,
Kyle's ex-wife out there.

132
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,878
Do you think you could divert her
so we could slip out?

133
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,130
What? No.

134
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:14,344
Okay, but I have two tickets
to the ballroom-dance finals.

135
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,847
I don't think so, Pheebs. I, heh...

136
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,143
All right, I'll do it.

137
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,147
- But just because you're a friend.
- Okay.

138
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,494
Aah!

139
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,038
Hi, Ginger.

140
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,873
I want my key back.

141
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,710
- I don't have it.
- It's right there.

142
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,045
Ugh. Okay, Sherlock.

143
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,090
I'm sorry, but you'd better go, Pheebs.

144
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,427
All right. I just wanted to thank you
for diverting Kyle's ex.

145
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,597
Oh, yeah, no, you're welcome.
We'll, uh, talk about it later.

146
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,056
- Okay.
- Heh.

147
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,268
- Hi, Whitney.
- Hi, Ross.

148
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,605
- Are you ready for breakfast?
- Yep. Ooh.

149
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:12,444
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed
to divert her, not date her.

150
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,740
Sorry, can you give me a second
while I talk to this woman...

151
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,451
...uh, who, by the way,
did not spend the night?

152
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,246
- Sure.
- Okay. Eh, heh...

153
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,710
I did divert her, and we ended up
having a great time, okay?

154
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,462
- Watching ballroom dancing?
- Yes.

155
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,798
That's where we realized
we are both super cool people.

156
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:39,137
Look, okay, Ross. Kyle just told me
some really bad stuff about her.

157
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,848
- Like what?
- Like she's really mean.

158
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,768
And she's overly critical and... And... No.

159
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:49,606
She will paint a room a really bright
color without even checking with you.

160
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,817
Okay.

161
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,154
And she uses sex as a weapon.

162
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,781
Fine. Thank you for warning me.

163
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:02,786
At breakfast, I'll be on full alert
for room painting and sex weapons.

164
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,706
- You're still gonna go out with her?
- Yeah.

165
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,376
Well, didn't you hear
what I just said?

166
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,629
Pheebs, come on.
I mean, consider the source.

167
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,800
Of course her ex-husband's gonna say
that stuff. Now if you'll excuse me.

168
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,260
No, listen to me, she is crazy!

169
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:23,598
Uh, your door isn't soundproof.

170
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,353
You see? Nothing is good enough
for her.

171
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,401
- Morning.
- Hi, Tag.

172
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:37,362
Hey, so did you have fun with,
uh, Joey last night?

173
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,197
Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.

174
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,116
Aw, that's nice.

175
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:44,828
Then we went to this bar, and he
hooked us up with all these women.

176
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,126
Women? You mean, like old women?

177
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,087
Kind of old, like 30.

178
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,970
- Oh.
- I never used to be able...

179
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,888
...to just talk to girls in bars...

180
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,225
...but I got, like, 20 phone numbers
last night.

181
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,812
That's great.

182
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,482
Oh, man. So Joey must have
really taught you some stuff.

183
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,818
- A little.
- Yeah.

184
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,112
How you doing?

185
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:31,458
See? That's a great smile.
Easy, natural.

186
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,543
Now pretend I have a camera.

187
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,047
- You're changing it.
- I can't help it.

188
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,718
All right. You want to know what I do
when I take résumé shots?

189
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,887
Borrow money from me?

190
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:49,768
Yeah. Okay, first of all,
you want to make it look spontaneous.

191
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:54,522
So here's what I do. I look down,
look down, keep looking down.

192
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,191
Then I look up.

193
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,570
See? All right, now you try.

194
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:04,032
Look down. You're looking down.
Keep looking down.

195
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,284
Why is there jelly on your shoe?

196
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,536
- I had a doughnut.
- Oh.

197
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,123
- Hi.
- Hey.

198
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,502
So, I heard you had some fun
with Tag last night.

199
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,045
Yeah, that guy's all right.

200
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:21,299
Yeah, and you had fun teaching him
how to be all "Joey."

201
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,469
- What?
- You know, all the women.

202
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,388
You can't teach someone
to be good with women.

203
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,183
That's why I never had
any luck with Chandler.

204
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,899
I'm right here.

205
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,487
Would you mind just not
going out with him again?

206
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:46,032
Just the idea of you and he
and all these women...

207
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,660
I know he's my assistant,
and I can't date him, blah!

208
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,703
But it bothers me, all right?

209
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,540
No, no, no, you can't take him
away from me.

210
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:57,502
I got a great partner to pick up
girls with. Finally!

211
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,967
I'm still right here.

212
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,427
All right, will you talk to him...

213
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:11,140
...and tell him how hollow and unsatisfying
this dating-tons-of-women thing is?

214
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,351
What?

215
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,189
I don't want him to meet anybody
until I'm over my crush.

216
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,691
And I will get over it.

217
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,861
It's not like I love him. It's just physical.

218
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,948
I get these crushes all the time.
Hell, I had a crush on you when I met you.

219
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,992
I know. Monica told me.

220
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,954
Did you have a crush on me
when you first met me?

221
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,208
Yeah, sure.

222
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,590
Can you people not see me?

223
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,219
So will you talk to him?

224
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,265
- I don't know, Rach.
- I'll give you 10 Ralph Lauren shirts.

225
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,850
One.

226
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,728
No, 10. You said 10.
You can't take that back.

227
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,362
Hey. You wanted to talk to me?

228
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,907
I don't know.
You, uh, got something for me?

229
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,658
Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.

230
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,748
Ten. Okay.

231
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,250
Tag, there's such a thing
as too many women.

232
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,170
- Really?
- Yeah, for you.

233
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,386
- Hey, there you are.
- There I am.

234
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,140
- You okay?
- Yeah, Joey said I, uh, needed to relax.

235
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,142
So he gave me an antihistamine.

236
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,936
- What?
- Yeah.

237
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,813
Then I fell asleep on the subway
and went to Brooklyn.

238
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,399
Brooklyn is far.

239
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,777
What were you thinking?

240
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:49,656
But don't worry, because
I know how to take a picture now.

241
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,785
Okay, see. Look down.

242
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:58,122
Look down.

243
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,630
- Chandler?
- Yeah?

244
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,763
- Hi.
- Hi.

245
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,976
So how are things going with Crazy?
Has she cooked your rabbit yet?

246
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,313
Listen, you are hearing one side
of the story. Okay?

247
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,234
FYI, she must have shown Kyle
over 30 paint samples...

248
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,986
...before she painted that room.

249
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:34,283
And his response to each one was,
"I don't give a tiny rat's ass."

250
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,787
Maybe she should have spent
a little less time decorating...

251
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,331
...and a little more time
in the bedroom.

252
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,543
I don't think we are going
to have that problem...

253
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:47,505
...but maybe that's because I am not
emotionally unavailable.

254
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,299
You think he's emotionally unavailable?

255
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,552
I think he can be.

256
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,721
Maybe he wouldn't be...

257
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,348
...if she didn't bring the office
home every night.

258
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,893
Well excuse her for knowing
what she wants to do with her life.

259
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:05,273
Well, she certainly knew what
she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.

260
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,444
I knew you were gonna
throw that in my face!

261
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,531
That was three years ago.
She apologized and apologized.

262
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,117
What more do you want?

263
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,911
We want the last six years back!

264
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,956
So do we! So do we!

265
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,838
I'm sorry you had to see that.

266
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,552
- Morning, Rachel.
- Hi.

267
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,971
Hey, so, uh, what'd you do last night?

268
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,931
- Went out with Joey.
- Oh, yeah?

269
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,810
Another night of bird-dogging
the chicas?

270
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:47,482
- No, we had a really good talk.
- Oh.

271
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,068
I don't think I'm gonna do
that bar scene anymore.

272
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,237
Wow, I did not see that coming.

273
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,740
It's just not really who I am.

274
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,409
No, I've always been happier when...

275
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,078
Why am I telling you this?

276
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,747
- You don't care about this stuff.
- Yes, I do. I do.

277
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,376
Go on. You were saying,
"I'm happier when I'm..."

278
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,128
When I'm in a relationship.

279
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,547
- I love having a girlfriend.
- Really?

280
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,050
Yeah. Someone I can spoil, you know.

281
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,677
- Sp... Spoil?
- Uh-huh.

282
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,848
- Let me ask you something.
- Uh-huh?

283
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,935
Do you believe there's one perfect
person for everyone?

284
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,604
I'm starting to.

285
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,650
If that person's in your life,
you should do something about it?

286
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,443
Yes. Hell, yes.

287
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,987
- All right, then, it's settled.
- Okay.

288
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,449
- I'm getting back together with my ex.
- I would love to!

289
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,159
What?

290
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,040
Hello?

291
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,169
Oh. This is gonna be a while.
Excuse me.

292
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,964
Um, yeah.

293
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,966
Yeah.

294
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,062
My God!

295
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,691
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying?

296
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,819
And speaking of being selfish in bed,
how's Whitney?

297
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,115
Maybe she wouldn't have to be
selfish in bed...

298
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,493
...if someone else knew where
everything was.

299
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,454
Oh, he knows. Heh.

300
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,290
For the most part.

301
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,044
Oh, hey. Good, you're both here.

302
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,172
We kind of need to talk.

303
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,674
- Both of you together?
- What's up?

304
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:40,928
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night
to pick up a few things...

305
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,056
...and we got to reminiscing.

306
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,892
We talked most of the night...

307
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,020
...and realized the reason
we're angry with each other...

308
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,732
...is because there are still
feelings there.

309
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,443
So...

310
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,697
Oh, just say it, Kyle!

311
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,785
We're gonna give it another try.

312
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:08,581
What about her whining,
and her constant need for attention?

313
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:09,957
I'm gonna work on that.

314
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,418
Oh, right, because you're so
capable of change.

315
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,088
You know, he hums when he pees.

316
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:22,386
- I do know.
- Makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.

317
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,348
We're so sorry.

318
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:30,019
That's all right. We don't need you.
I'm over it already.

319
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,397
Yeah, and I don't even give
a tiny rat's ass.

320
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,734
Yeah, we're gonna go.

321
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,531
I'm sorry.

322
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,866
Agh.

323
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:47,203
Pheebs, you were right about her.

324
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,123
You know, she did try to use
sex as a weapon.

325
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,417
Yeah, I hurt my back a little.

326
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,965
You know, he hums while he does
other stuff too.

327
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,470
- We're better off without them.
- Heh.

328
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:09,141
Even if they break up again, you better
not let him in your sad men's club.

329
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,603
- Divorced men's club.
- Potato, "potato."

330
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,902
Hey, guys, check it out.
