1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,502
Here you go, Pheebs.

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:06,338
Who wants one of my
special home-baked brownies?

3
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:07,589
I'll have one.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,967
Agh! Ugh.

5
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,177
- That's okay.
- I'm not having one.

6
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:14,888
No, no. It's just my tooth.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,974
- All right.
- I'll have one.

8
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,686
So you need a dentist?
I've got a good one.

9
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:25,107
Thanks. I have a good one too.
I just can't see him.

10
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,193
See, that is the problem
with invisible dentists.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,280
Why can't you go to him?

12
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:36,368
Because every time I go
to the dentist, somebody dies.

13
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:40,497
That's so weird.
Every time I go to the dentist...

14
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,875
...I look down the hygienist's blouse.

15
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:46,295
Phoebe, what, um?

16
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,546
What?

17
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,298
First, it was my Aunt Mary.

18
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,092
And then there was, um,
John, my mailman.

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,887
And then my cowboy friend, Albino Bob.

20
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,307
Ahem. And all these people actually died?

21
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,684
Yes. While I was in the chair.

22
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:04,021
That's why I take care of my teeth.
It's not about oral hygiene.

23
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,315
I floss to save lives.

24
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,151
Come on, you didn't kill anybody.

25
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:13,072
These people just happened to die
when you went to the dentist.

26
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,740
It's just a coincidence.

27
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,743
Tell that to them.
Oh, you can't! They're dead!

28
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,920
Thanks, Gunther.

29
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,380
- Hi.
- Hey.

30
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,006
Um, can I get a napkin too?

31
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,843
Oh, like you don't already
have everything.

32
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,013
Ow!

33
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,852
You're in pain. Would you just
go to the dentist? Just go.

34
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,146
Fine. But if you're my next victim...

35
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,649
...don't come back as a poltergeist
who sucks me into the TV set.

36
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,484
I promise.

37
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,570
Although, don't feel like you can't visit.

38
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,700
Hey, is Chandler here?

39
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,452
No. No, he's not.

40
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:48,584
You guys, Joey just saw
Janice kissing her ex-husband.

41
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,002
- Huh? Oh!
- What?

42
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,213
What are you gonna do?
How are you gonna tell Chandler?

43
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,633
I was thinking about that.
I think the best way would be...

44
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:57,843
...to not.

45
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:02,014
Joey, if you know about this,
you have to tell him.

46
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,474
It'll kill him. It'll just kill him.

47
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,519
Wait till I go to the dentist.
Maybe I'll kill him.

48
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,025
Ew!

49
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:18,113
Ugly Naked Guy's using a hammock.
It's like a Play-Doh fat factory.

50
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,200
I'm going to the dentist. So listen...

51
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:25,621
...just be on the lookout for anything
that you could fall into...

52
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,457
...or that can fall on you...

53
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,000
...or...

54
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,543
All right, just look out!

55
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,547
Okay? And, um, I also just want to...

56
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,967
I just want to tell you all that, um...

57
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,434
I have a problem. I have to go
into work for a few hours.

58
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,978
Some kids messed up
the Homo sapien display.

59
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,563
What did they do?

60
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,858
They painted over the word
"sapien," for one thing.

61
00:03:55,735 --> 00:04:00,614
Then they rearranged the figures.
Let's just leave it at that.

62
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,574
Do you want me to watch Ben for you?

63
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,534
Yes, that's what I was gonna ask.
Thank you.

64
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,537
Woah, wait, hello! Heh, what about me?

65
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:11,124
You. You want to watch Ben?

66
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,965
That would be great!
I just asked Monica...

67
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,425
...because I know how empty her life is.

68
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,516
- Hey, Ross? I got a science question.
- Yeah. Mm-hm.

69
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:33,480
If the Homo sapiens were, in fact,
"homo" sapiens...

70
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,400
...is that why they're extinct?

71
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,448
Joey, Homo sapiens are people.

72
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,950
Hey, I'm not judging.

73
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,163
Look, Benny! Spoon!

74
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,457
Spoon!

75
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,795
Come on. All right, you know what?
I think he's bored.

76
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,506
Here. You wanna play
the airplane game?

77
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,633
You wanna show Rachel? Come here.

78
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,885
You wanna do something fun? Okay.

79
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,220
Whee!

80
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,225
Whee! Ha, ha, oh!

81
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,358
You're so brave.
You're so brave! Yes, you are.

82
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,444
- You're so brave.
- You're okay.

83
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,863
He's fine. Let's just put him down.

84
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,949
Come here, babe.
Yes, you're such a good boy.

85
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:30,370
How could you do that to him?
Ross trusted me! What's he gonna say?

86
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,581
Nothing, because we're not telling him.

87
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,915
- We're not?
- No.

88
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,084
- All right, I like that.
- Okay.

89
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,171
So we're okay. We're okay, aren't we?

90
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,048
No, we're not okay. There's a bump.

91
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,924
- There's a bump.
- What bump?

92
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,635
Oh, my God! Well, push it in! Push it in!

93
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,597
I can not push it in!

94
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,558
- Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
- Okay.

95
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,976
- That's it.
- Okay.

96
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,311
- I got it!
- Okay.

97
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,188
- The second Ross walks in...
- Yeah.

98
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,649
...take him to your bedroom and do
whatever you do that makes him go:

99
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,780
Or...

100
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,116
...we could put a hat on his head.

101
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:13,121
A hat! Yes! We need a hat! Where
are we gonna find a tiny little hat?

102
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,956
Oh, oh, oh! I'll get Rainy Day Bear!

103
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,459
Because he'll know what to do?

104
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,378
Oh, my God. You're a genius!

105
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,463
Oh, God. It's kind of sewn on.

106
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,090
- Give it. Give it.
- Okay.

107
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,674
- Oh!
- Oh.

108
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,806
Agh, it's just like a bloodbath
in here today!

109
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,438
Hey, hold on a second.
Hold on a second.

110
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,401
Do you think these pearls are nice?

111
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,444
I'd prefer a mountain bike.

112
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,990
Janice's birthday's coming.
I wanna get her something special.

113
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,203
- Come in here with me.
- Woah, woah, whoa, wait. Woah.

114
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,666
You wanna get her something special?
Get her flowers.

115
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,585
Get her candy. Get her gum.
Girls love gum.

116
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,756
That's a good idea. "Dear Janice:
Have a Hubba-Bubba birthday."

117
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,343
I'd like to get her something serious.

118
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,096
Oh, you want something serious.

119
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,599
You know what you should do?
You should get her one of those, um...

120
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,226
...barium enemas.

121
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,272
Those are dead serious.

122
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,110
Look, I'm gonna go in here.
And you don't buy me anything, ever!

123
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,946
You can't! You can't.
You can't buy her pearls.

124
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,532
You just can't, you can't, you can't!

125
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,451
Why not?

126
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,288
Oh, God. Uh, okay.

127
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,957
Here's the thing. Ahem.

128
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,668
This is the thing. Okay, the thing is...

129
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:42,961
- What is the thing?
- Okay.

130
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,924
I went down to the
Mattress King's showroom...

131
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,011
...and I saw Janice kissing
her ex-husband.

132
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,306
What?

133
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,099
They were in his office.

134
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,314
Well, she... She wouldn't do that.
She's with me.

135
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,149
I'm telling you, I saw it.

136
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,234
Well, you're wrong. Okay? You're wrong.

137
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,069
I'm not wrong.

138
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,447
I wish I was.

139
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,950
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,373
Bet that barium enema
doesn't sound so bad now, huh?

141
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:28,048
It makes more sense as an ensemble.
And it takes the focus off the hat.

142
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,968
Oh! You're alive! You're alive!

143
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,805
See? I promised you
no one would die, didn't I?

144
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,518
We'll see about that. Can I use your
phone to call everyone I know?

145
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,479
Sure. We have no money. Go ahead.

146
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,983
Hey, you're not dead! Okay, see you.

147
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,737
Monica.

148
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,573
Oh, my God! He just said my name!

149
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,575
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

150
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,161
Monica bang!

151
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,792
Ahem. Okay, I heard that.

152
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,294
- Did he just say, "Monica bang"?
- Mm-hm.

153
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,130
Oh, my God! He's gonna rat me out!

154
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,425
- Monica bang!
- Oh, ho, ho.

155
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,346
Sweetie, you need to stop
saying that now.

156
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,099
It's no big deal.
It's not even worth mentioning.

157
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,351
You see? We all do it all the time.

158
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,644
See? Watch this.

159
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,771
Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow.

160
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,649
Monica bang!
Everybody bang!

161
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,150
Ben bang!

162
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,944
Rachel bang!

163
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,113
Bang, Rachel! Bang!

164
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,157
- Oh, isn't it fun?
- Look at that! Look at that!

165
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,201
We all do it!

166
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,662
- Okay, I'm stopping now.
- Are you okay?

167
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,916
Oh, yeah. You know, if it's not
a headboard, it's just not worth it.

168
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,096
How's my Bing-a-ling?

169
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,266
Uh...

170
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,018
I don't know.

171
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,228
You tell me.

172
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,357
Anything you, uh, want to tell me?

173
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,276
Because if you, uh... You should...

174
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,570
You would tell me.

175
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,033
Why are your eyes so wide?

176
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,493
You tell me.

177
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,496
Maybe it's because I was just
fooling around with my ex.

178
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,124
Oh, no. No, no, no. That was you!

179
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,667
Oh, my God!

180
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,669
- All right!
- How did you know?

181
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,005
Joey told me. He saw you two kissing.

182
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,715
In the park?

183
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,677
No. In his office.
How many kisses were there?

184
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,597
- Just those two!
- Wh...? Why? Why?

185
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,558
Why was there kissing?
There should be no kissing!

186
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,478
Oh, I'm sorry, honey. I'm so, so...

187
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,439
I'm so, so sorry. I just...

188
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,569
What happened was I...
I can't breathe.

189
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,490
Can you get me a bag or something?
Aah.

190
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,158
- Here. Here.
- Aah.

191
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,409
There.

192
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,165
- It's the receipt.
- I'll take it.

193
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,460
Look, I've got to know.

194
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,756
Are you finished with me?

195
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,386
Are you finished with him?

196
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,767
Do you still love him?

197
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,146
Do you still love me?

198
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,483
All right, look...

199
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,237
...I'm gonna need an actual
answer here, okay?

200
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,322
So which is it?

201
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,033
Him or me?

202
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,253
I don't know.

203
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,925
Okay, if you're alive,
you answer your phone!

204
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:07,767
Ben, I won't tell your daddy
that you had ice cream before dinner...

205
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:11,771
...if you won't tell him about
our little bonking incident.

206
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,400
Number one, I don't think Ben
understands the concept of bribery.

207
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,277
And number two, I...

208
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,488
What?

209
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,116
You said "number two."

210
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,412
I also said "number one."

211
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,164
Ha-ha-ha, I know.

212
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,334
- Hey, everyone!
- Hi!

213
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,503
How's my little boy?

214
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,672
He's perfect. Aren't you, Ben?

215
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,550
- He's never been better.
- What did you do, take him whaling?

216
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,054
Monica.

217
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:49,601
Oh, my God! He just said your name!
That's great! Good job, Ben!

218
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,020
Monica bang!

219
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,688
Ha-ha-ha. That's right.

220
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,775
That's what I'd sound like
if I exploded.

221
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,404
Woo-hoo! The curse is broken!
I called everybody I know...

222
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,448
...and everyone is alive!

223
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,619
- Huh.
- What?

224
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,040
Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.

225
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,422
Oh, my God, I killed another one!

226
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,676
The curse is getting stronger too,
to bring down something that big.

227
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,095
Maybe he's just taking a nap.

228
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,807
I'm telling you,
he hasn't moved since this morning.

229
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,475
We should call somebody.

230
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,895
Tell them the naked guy we stare at
isn't moving?

231
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,397
We've got to find out if he's alive.

232
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,025
How are we gonna do that?
There's no way.

233
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,985
Well, there is one way.

234
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,072
His window's open. I say...

235
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,740
...we poke him.

236
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,995
Hey!

237
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,748
You know how we, uh,
save all those chopsticks...

238
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,376
...for no reason
when we get Chinese food?

239
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,669
Yeah?

240
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,255
Well, now we got a reason.

241
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,215
What?

242
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,301
Well, we're fashioning a very long
poking device.

243
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,763
All right.

244
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,893
Hey, uh, what's the matter?

245
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,022
I talked to Janice.

246
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,276
Oh, my God. Is she going back to him?

247
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,111
She doesn't know.

248
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,779
Says she loves us both.

249
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,450
I woke up this morning, I was in love.

250
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,411
I was happy!

251
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,582
It serves me right for buying
that 12-pack of condoms.

252
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,796
And now I can't even return them,
because she choked on the receipt!

253
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,176
What are you, uh...?
What are you gonna do?

254
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,806
I don't know.

255
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,434
You know? What would you do?

256
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,855
Uh, it doesn't matter what I'd do.

257
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,690
Come on. Come on. Tell me.

258
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,111
All right, you, uh...

259
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,741
...you probably won't want
to hear this, but, uh...

260
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,496
...if it was me,
and this is just me, I would, uh...

261
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,832
- I would bow out.
- What?

262
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,045
What are you talking about?

263
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,966
They have a kid together...

264
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,552
...you know? They're like...

265
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,013
They're, like, a family.

266
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,515
And if, I don't know...

267
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:38,019
...if there's a chance
they can make that work...

268
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,022
...I wouldn't want to be the guy
who stood in the way.

269
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,362
You okay?

270
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,406
You, uh?

271
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,700
You wanna come poke a nude guy?

272
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,082
- Well, he's finally asleep.
- Mm.

273
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,418
About that, uh, bump on his head...

274
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,755
Are you, uh, sure it's a new bump?

275
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:10,176
No offense, but I've always thought
of Ben as a fairly bumpy-headed child.

276
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,846
It's okay if he bumps his head.
Kids bump their heads all the time.

277
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:17,141
It was your first time babysitting.
You did your best.

278
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,727
- I did!
- I know.

279
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,230
You just have to watch them
all the time.

280
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,233
I did! I watched! I watched!

281
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,903
I watched Monica bang his head
against that thing!

282
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,447
Monica did it?

283
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,411
- Monica? Um...
- Yeah.

284
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:40,581
Did you notice anything weird
about Ben today?

285
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,709
No, why?

286
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,963
I was just playing with him, and we
were doing the "Alphabet Song"...

287
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,174
...which he's good at.
But he left out "E" and "F."

288
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:54,762
It's like they just, uh, I don't know,
fell out of his head.

289
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,432
Really?

290
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,810
Oh, and also, he's walking...

291
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,603
...kind of funny.

292
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:08,776
It's like his left leg is moving
a lot faster than his right leg.

293
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:12,113
Yeah, he's in there,
just sort of, you know...

294
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,785
Oh, my God! I wrecked your baby!

295
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,124
I hope it's still funny
when you're in hell.

296
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,334
You jerk!

297
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:30,631
- You know I love that kid!
- Monica bang! Monica bang!

298
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,925
Ow.

299
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,678
I'll get the hat.

300
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,726
I have something to tell you.

301
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,062
And I want you to let me
get through it...

302
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,147
...because...

303
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,025
...it's not gonna be easy.

304
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,069
Okay.

305
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,531
I think you should go back with Gary.

306
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,411
I don't want to be the guy
that breaks up a family.

307
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,707
You know, when my parents split up,
it was because of that guy.

308
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,126
Whenever I'd see him,
I'd always think:

309
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:10,880
"You're the reason.
You are why they're not together."

310
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,050
And I hated that guy.

311
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:20,139
And it didn't matter how nice he was
or how happy he made my dad.

312
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,687
Wow!

313
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,315
Yeah, wow.

314
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,361
- It's the right thing to do.
- Ugh.

315
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,446
You're right.

316
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:41,661
Oh, God.
But before I can say goodbye...

317
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,456
...there's something I really
need you to know.

318
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,584
The way I feel about you...

319
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,963
...it's like I finally understand...

320
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,549
...what Lionel Richie's
been singing about.

321
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,052
You know? I mean, what we have...

322
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,139
...it's like movie love.

323
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,308
You're my soul mate.

324
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:09,647
I can't believe we're not gonna
spend the rest of our lives together.

325
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,151
Then don't leave me.

326
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,486
What?

327
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,614
Forget what I said! I was babbling!
Pick me!

328
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:22,493
No, you were right!
I gotta give my marriage another chance.

329
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,662
Pssh! No, you don't!

330
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,666
No, I say you have to give your divorce
another chance!

331
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,879
I'm sorry.

332
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,594
Oh, don't go.

333
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,929
No, I gotta go.

334
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:46,309
No. No. No, no.

335
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,519
Honey. Honey. Ha, ha.

336
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,063
- People are looking.
- I don't care.

337
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,608
I don't care!

338
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,986
Yeah, um, okay. I'm...

339
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,696
I'm leaving now.

340
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,743
You can't leave! I have your shoe!

341
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,832
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.

342
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,095
Rachel has those in burgundy.

343
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:31,562
Remember, something this big and long
will be very difficult to maneuver.

344
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,814
Fortunately,
I have experience in that area.

345
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:39,987
Can we please focus here?
A naked man's life hangs in the balance.

346
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,614
I'm telling you, he's dead.

347
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:45,326
What we're about to have here
is a dead fat guy on a stick!

348
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,121
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
let's poke.

349
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,250
Steady.

350
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,335
Okay, a little higher.

351
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,212
Careful of the angle.

352
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,131
Okay, okay.
We're approaching the window.

353
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,513
Thread the needle. Thread the needle.

354
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,896
He's alive! He's alive!

355
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,401
And yet we're still poking him.

356
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,237
Okay, retract the device!
Retract the device!

357
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:24,615
- He does not look happy.
- Hey, hey.

358
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,785
Now he's showing us his poking device.

359
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:33,332
Hey, that's never gonna make it
all the way over here, buddy! Ha.

360
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:43,843
I'll hold you close in my arms

361
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:49,098
I can't resist your charms

362
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,392
And love

363
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,894
Love

364
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:59,817
I'll be a fool for you

365
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,820
I'm sure

366
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,615
You know I don't mind

367
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,493
Oh, you know I don't mind

368
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,829
Yes

369
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:16,542
You mean the world to me

370
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,920
- Oh, I know
- I know

371
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,840
- I've found
- I've found

372
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,259
In you

373
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:35,728
My endless love

374
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,398
Love

375
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,693
- Lo... Love
- Love
