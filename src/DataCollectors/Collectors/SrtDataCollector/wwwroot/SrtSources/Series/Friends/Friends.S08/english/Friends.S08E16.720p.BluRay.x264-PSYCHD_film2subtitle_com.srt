00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:10,551
I'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?

00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,637
Yes.

00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,475
Um, you like Rachel?

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,647
Yes. I like Rachel.

00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,364
Rachel?

6
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,951
Yeah. Okay, but look, you know...

7
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,495
You know who else I like? You.

8
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:42,499
And it doesn't get said enough.
I like you, Ross.

00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,212
- "Rachel" Rachel?
- It's not a big deal.

10
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,883
It's not a big deal?
I'm sorry, I just...

11
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,344
What about the stuff you said?

12
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:59,266
How you can't stop thinking about her?
How you can't sleep?

And I know it's wrong, okay?

It's not like anything's
ever gonna happen.

Rachel?

Rachel?

00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,892
Oh, oh! Okay, she's kicking.

00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,354
She's growing inside you.

- Whoa!
- Oh.

27
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:33,360
- That was a big one.
- That's the youngest girl to reject me.

- You guys!
- Hey there.

29
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:39,283
Let me ask you.
Do you believe in soul mates?

30
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,784
Oh, yes, I do.

31
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,787
There's one person out there
for everyone.

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,999
You know how you find him?
Stop looking.

33
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,252
I've stopped looking
for Russell Crowe.

34
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,296
He'll find me.

35
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,630
Uh-huh. And you?

36
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:59,094
No. I believe that, uh, certain people are
more suited for each other, but...

37
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,930
- Soul mates? I don't think they exist.
- Good.

38
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,933
- Why?
- Well, last night, I met Monica's.

- What?
- Yeah.

41
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:15,152
I had a date with this guy.
I swear he's her other half.

You don't think there's somebody
better suited for Monica than me?

Well, what's he like?

44
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:29,333
- He's tall. He has brown hair.
- Of course.

45
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:34,004
A tall guy with hair similar to mine?
Oh, unknowable universe!

46
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:37,257
- He works with food.
- Oh, sure. Older?

47
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,968
- Obviously. And he's British.
- I was just gonna ask!

48
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:45,682
Yeah? And he's so centered,
and mature and confident.

49
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,352
It's so sad they never met.

50
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:53,148
Luckily, the guy she settled for
can't hear you.

Oh, I'm so sorry.
Maybe I'm wrong.

We're going out again.
I'll find out more.

He's meant for her,
and you're gonna date him?

00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,588
I talked to Joey.
I wanted to see you.

I still can't believe it.
Joey and Rachel?

It's like you and me going out,
only weirder.

I know you're hurting...

61
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,518
...but don't say that again.

62
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:35,440
What if they marry?
He'd be the stepfather of my child.

You don't need to worry.

64
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,487
He'll never tell her how he feels.

If he did, you don't know
how she'd react.

Sure, women never like Joey.
I think he's a virgin.

- He isn't thinking about going for her.
- He's not?

All he's thinking about
is how you're taking this.

It's freaking him out.
He wants to move to Vermont.

- Why?
- He wants to leave the country.

71
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,935
He thinks you hate him.

72
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,730
Hate him?

73
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,859
No, I don't hate him.

this must be for you...

to lose Joey over it.

Right now, he needs to know
that you're still his friend.

78
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,757
Okay, I'll talk to him.

his dollars into Vermont money.

- What's with the sun-dried tomatoes?
- I know! Is this 1985?

- That's what I said! Isn't it strange?
- Not really.

What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?

do not hate you.

It'll take me a while to get over her.

I think the smellier, the better.

171
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:44,012
- I'd move in tomorrow!
- Oh, come on!

172
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,016
- Listen to this!
- I'm so sorry.

173
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:52,520
- What do we do?
- They both want a house of cheese.

174
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,107
I don't know how you fight that.

175
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:06,868
Okay, okay. I can do this.
I can tell her how I feel.

176
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,454
Okay, stand up straight.

177
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,582
Take a couple deep breaths.

178
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,085
Look confident.

179
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,925
Joey? What's up?

180
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:26,554
I came by because
I want to talk to you about something.

181
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,847
What's up?

182
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,226
Here, in the hall?
What are we, animals?

183
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,896
I'm late for a meeting.
Could you make it quick?

184
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,733
I just came by to tell you that...

185
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,987
...I want to have dinner with you.

186
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:47,784
- Sure. Just tell me where to meet you.
- Okay.

187
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,287
Okay. That's good.

188
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,833
That gives you a couple of hours
to prepare.

189
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,378
Don't you people ever knock?

190
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,715
I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over.

191
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,384
Sure. Set it up.

192
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,846
I'll just be browsing
through the personals.

193
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,349
Are you okay?
You're acting weird.

194
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Yeah. Fine.

195
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,185
Not perfect.

196
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,312
But good enough.

197
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,398
Jeez, what's with you?

198
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,651
I'm sorry, did you say "cheese"?

199
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:27,323
- What's going on?
- Phoebe says you and Don are soul mates.

200
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,785
I don't believe in that,
but you two get along.

201
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:36,291
I'll step aside if you wanna go with
Don and live in a house of cheese.

202
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:41,629
- You don't believe in soul mates?
- No, but I'm sure "tomatoes" does.

203
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,050
I don't believe in soul mates, either.

204
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,552
- You don't?
- Nope.

205
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,388
We weren't destined
to end up together.

206
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,225
We fell in love and work hard
at our relationship.

207
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:57,145
Some days we work really hard.

208
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:01,983
So you don't want to live with Don
in a cheese house?

209
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:08,197
No, I've had second thoughts.
Do you know how hard it'd be to clean?

210
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,909
- I love you.
- I know.

211
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,661
I'm gonna take you out to dinner.

212
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:18,291
I found this place that makes the greatest
mozzarella sticks and jalapeño poppers.

213
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,045
No? They taste so good.

214
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,846
It happens whenever Chandler
touches my stomach.

215
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,933
I'm worried the baby won't like him.

216
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,230
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, sure.

217
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:46,736
Uh, look, the reason...

218
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,823
Is it hot in here?

219
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:54,285
No, not for me.
Why don't you take off your sweater?

220
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,246
This is a nice place...

221
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:02,293
...and my T-shirt has a picture
of Calvin doing Hobbes.

222
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:06,297
Oh, my God, really? Can I see it?

223
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,757
Yeah, sure.

224
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:14,263
I wouldn't think Hobbes
would like that so much.

225
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,058
Uh...

226
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,397
How long have we known each other?

227
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,233
Um, seven, eight...

228
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,527
Eight years. Wow.

229
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,821
- Uh-huh. A long time.
- Yeah.

230
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,158
But over the past few weeks, I...

231
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,913
Okay! Sorry about the wait,
but it is mega-jammed in here.

232
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,873
Our specials tonight...

233
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,751
- Could you give us a second?
- Sure.

234
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,253
Second's up!

235
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,093
Not that kind of table.

236
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,931
So you were saying?

237
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,018
I'm not sure.

238
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:04,981
You asked how long we knew each other,
and I said eight years.

239
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:09,652
Then the waiter came over
and cut his tip in half...

240
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,406
...and now here we are.

241
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,826
Yeah. Here we are.

242
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,996
Uh...

243
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,464
I think I'm falling in love with you.

244
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,217
What?

245
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,222
I'm falling in love with you.

246
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,566
Who are you talking to?

247
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,945
Oh, you're kidding. It's a joke.

248
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,907
Funny. It's funny!

249
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,242
I don't get it.

250
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,582
Oh.

251
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,170
Okay.

252
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,509
Wow.

253
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,055
Are you, um?

254
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,227
How did, um?

255
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,562
When?

256
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,400
Does it really matter?

257
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,905
Wow. Wow.

258
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,366
It is hot in here.

259
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,284
I know this is a lot.

260
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,788
You don't have to say anything.

261
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:48,251
You take as much time as you need.

262
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,552
Okay, you gotta say something.

263
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:03,015
Joey, I love you so much.

264
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,309
- But...
- But.

265
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,603
Joey?

266
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,481
Right. Hey, that's, uh...

267
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,025
That's okay. That's fine.

268
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:18,156
It's, uh, pretty much
what I was expecting.

269
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,118
It's no big deal, all right?

270
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,083
- I think I'm gonna go.
- Please don't leave like this.

271
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:33,045
You can't do this to a pregnant woman!

272
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,548
Don't start doing that.

273
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,343
You can't do that,
because you're gonna make me...

274
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,554
Oh, there we go!

275
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:47,143
- Can I?
- Sure.

276
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,606
Oh, Joey. I don't want to lose...

277
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,941
Hey, hey.

278
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,488
You can't, okay? Ever.

279
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,201
I'm so sorry.

280
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,495
Please don't be sorry.

281
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,956
Okay? Don't be sorry.

282
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,176
You know, I was only kidding.

283
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,763
Yeah, that was a real good one.

284
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,317
- Is this your table?
- Yeah.

285
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,028
- You'll be here all night.
- I know.

286
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,864
I haven't even read the specials.

287
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,824
What's the matter?

288
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:48,829
I don't know.
I think maybe one of them is dying.

289
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,168
I kind of hope it's the girl.

290
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,256
The guy is really cute!

291
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,012
