1
00:00:04,116 --> 00:00:06,778
Wow! You look nice.
What's the occasion?

2
00:00:06,985 --> 00:00:09,681
Monica and l are celebrating
our 1 0-month anniversary.

3
00:00:09,888 --> 00:00:11,617
Got reservations at Jean-George.

4
00:00:12,157 --> 00:00:13,181
How'd you get in?

5
00:00:13,392 --> 00:00:15,451
Made a few calls,
pulled some strings...

6
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:19,722
...and they'll seat us if we both
have chicken and don't get dessert.

7
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:24,793
-Hi, Chandler.
-Hey, Caitlin.

8
00:00:25,003 --> 00:00:26,197
Somebody got a haircut.

9
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:28,805
l hate it. l look like
an 8-year-old boy.

10
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:32,704
lf that was true, gym class
would've been more interesting.

11
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:38,847
-lt's $27 even.
-Okay. Here you go.

12
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:40,075
Where's the chicken?

13
00:00:40,352 --> 00:00:43,150
lt's in the back.
The duck pissed him off.

14
00:00:43,522 --> 00:00:45,319
He said that eggs came first.

15
00:00:46,158 --> 00:00:48,149
-Thanks. l'll see you later.
-Bye.

16
00:00:52,097 --> 00:00:53,826
What the hell was that?

17
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:56,033
-What?
-The flirting.

18
00:00:56,268 --> 00:00:59,760
Aren't you supposed to be going out
with, let's see, my sister?

19
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:01,728
l wasn't flirting.

20
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,434
lt was totally flirting!
''Somebody got a haircut....''

21
00:01:08,513 --> 00:01:11,676
First of all, the impression?
Uncanny.

22
00:01:12,384 --> 00:01:16,377
Second, that wasn't flirting.
That was just casual conversation.

23
00:01:16,855 --> 00:01:18,186
Yeah, right.

24
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,620
You wanna see flirting?
l'll show you.

25
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,125
l'm good.

26
00:01:24,896 --> 00:01:27,057
The One Where Ross Can't Flirt

27
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,777
l am so proud of Joey.

28
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:16,072
-He's gonna be on <i>Law and Order</i>!
-l know.

29
00:02:16,314 --> 00:02:19,613
Don't you think it should
be called <i>Order and Law</i>?

30
00:02:19,818 --> 00:02:22,548
No, because they arrest the guy
and then try him.

31
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:24,448
Don't get me started on that.

32
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:29,457
-l was not flirting.
-And on your anniversary. For shame!

33
00:02:30,262 --> 00:02:31,251
What's going on?

34
00:02:31,463 --> 00:02:33,658
He was hitting on
the hot delivery girl.

35
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:36,557
l was not. And oh, God!

36
00:02:37,602 --> 00:02:40,503
You were. lf anyone
should be hitting on her...

37
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,570
...it's the guy who's single...

38
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:44,934
...the guy who can do
something about it.

39
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:48,237
Sounds like someone wants to be
Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.

40
00:02:50,649 --> 00:02:53,243
ls that what this is about?
You like Caitlin?

41
00:02:55,754 --> 00:02:59,850
Ross, we broke up two years ago.
You've been married since then.

42
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:02,524
l think it's okay
that we see other people.

43
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:07,196
l was watching her
at the pizza place.

44
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:12,095
And she was just so sexy and funny
and has the cutest little--

45
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:14,305
We don't need her measurements.

46
00:03:15,674 --> 00:03:17,642
Pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni.

47
00:03:17,843 --> 00:03:20,505
She's pretty and you love her,
but is she stupid?

48
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,872
She forgot my vegetarian.

49
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:28,485
This is perfect. She'll have
to come back here with your pizza.

50
00:03:28,687 --> 00:03:33,021
And when she does,
l will turn on the charm ''au'' Ross.

51
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:36,350
l am so glad you don't eat meat.

52
00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:39,687
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.

53
00:03:40,465 --> 00:03:44,265
Hey, everybody, look who's here!
You remember my grandmother.

54
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:46,494
-Big night!
-Yeah, it's so cool.

55
00:03:46,705 --> 00:03:48,900
Joey on <i>Law and Order.</i>
You must be proud.

56
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,805
She doesn't understand
a word of English.

57
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:54,477
l thought you were
Joey's other grandmother.

58
00:03:56,882 --> 00:03:58,349
l've done it again.

59
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:02,343
Nonnie's my biggest fan.

60
00:04:02,587 --> 00:04:06,216
She's the only one in the family
who's always believed in me.

61
00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:09,723
<i>S</i>i. Big star.

62
00:04:09,928 --> 00:04:13,056
My big fat Joey star.

63
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,169
Yeah, l weighed, like,
27 pounds when l was born.

64
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:27,673
-Happy anniversary!
-Happy anniversary, 1 0 months.

65
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:32,381
ln the shower l was thinking
about our first night in London.

66
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:34,677
Joey's grandmother's right there.

67
00:04:34,886 --> 00:04:37,446
-The one who speaks English?
-The one who doesn't.

68
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:39,953
That was some hot love you gave me.

69
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,393
-l'll get ready.
-Wear those earrings l got you.

70
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:47,257
That's a great idea. l was saving
them for something special.

71
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:52,694
-You've got to go home.
-But l like it here.

72
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:57,233
Get the earrings you borrowed.
He wants me to wear them.

73
00:04:57,442 --> 00:05:01,435
l think they're in my purse.
Go get dressed and l'll look for them.

74
00:05:04,983 --> 00:05:07,076
l need those earrings you borrowed.

75
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:13,120
Yeah, l'll be right back.

76
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:25,292
Pheebs, you speak ltalian?

77
00:05:25,604 --> 00:05:26,764
l guess so.

78
00:05:30,842 --> 00:05:33,333
-Here you go.
-Thanks. Where's the other one?

79
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:38,781
Oh, what, you want both of them?
That's a little greedy, don't you think?

80
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,544
Rachel Karen Greene,
where's the other one?

81
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,746
Look, just don't freak out,
but l kind of lost it.

82
00:05:44,956 --> 00:05:48,448
l know it's in the apartment,
but l definitely lost it.

83
00:05:49,027 --> 00:05:52,019
What'll l tell Monica?
She wants to wear them tonight.

84
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,597
-Tell her to wear her own earrings.
-These are her earrings.

85
00:05:58,303 --> 00:06:02,103
You lent me her earrings?
l'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!

86
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:05,803
-Why not?
-Because l lose her stuff!

87
00:06:13,952 --> 00:06:17,615
You see that blind guy?
l'm gonna bash his head in later.

88
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,822
My big scene's coming up.
The big scene coming up.

89
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:28,429
lf you said, ''Big lima bean bubbling up,''
would she know the difference?

90
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:32,066
What are you doing?

91
00:06:32,604 --> 00:06:35,573
Oh, l just can't watch.
lt's too scary.

92
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:38,241
lt's a diaper commercial.

93
00:06:39,344 --> 00:06:43,405
Yeah, well, you know me.
Babies, responsibilities....

94
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:49,242
-Pizza delivery.
-l'll get it! l will get that!

95
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:53,121
How does my hair look?

96
00:06:53,258 --> 00:06:56,716
Ross, it hasn't moved since 1 996.

97
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:05,264
One vegetarian pizza.
lt's 1 2.50.

98
00:07:06,805 --> 00:07:09,273
By the way, if it makes
you feel any better...

99
00:07:09,474 --> 00:07:11,601
...l happen to like
8-year-old boys.

100
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:16,936
What?

101
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:21,819
Your hair.
Before. Your hair.

102
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:26,114
You said you thought your hair
looked like an 8-year-old boy's...

103
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:28,485
...and l'm just saying l like it.

104
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:30,190
The hair.

105
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,891
Thanks.

106
00:07:36,301 --> 00:07:39,998
You understand, l don't actually
like 8-year-old boys.

107
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,165
All l'm looking for is the money.

108
00:07:44,576 --> 00:07:47,067
Here you go.
Stop bringing us pizzas, you.

109
00:07:47,312 --> 00:07:48,711
l'm gonna try.

110
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,476
You're welcome.

111
00:07:53,718 --> 00:07:55,982
You couldn't let me have her,
could you?

112
00:07:57,222 --> 00:08:01,158
This is a girl l really like,
and you had to swoop in there!

113
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:02,348
What?

114
00:08:02,494 --> 00:08:05,327
Chandler was flirting
with the hot delivery girl.

115
00:08:07,232 --> 00:08:08,392
Thank you for that.

116
00:08:10,602 --> 00:08:11,694
l was not flirting.

117
00:08:11,903 --> 00:08:13,871
lt's okay. l don't care.
That's fine.

118
00:08:14,205 --> 00:08:16,036
Really?

119
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,541
lt's no big deal.
l do it all the time.

120
00:08:22,547 --> 00:08:24,845
You flirt with guys all the time?

121
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:29,614
lt doesn't mean anything. Just like
it doesn't mean anything with you.

122
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:32,254
There's a difference.
You're a lot hotter.

123
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:33,719
True story.

124
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,859
This actually bothers you?

125
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:39,586
Yes, and l think
it'd bother a lot of people.

126
00:08:39,864 --> 00:08:41,456
When you and Ross dated...

127
00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:44,759
...did it bother you
when he flirted with other women?

128
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:48,302
No, it bothered me when
he slept with other women.

129
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,941
And thank you for that.

130
00:08:55,113 --> 00:08:56,944
l never had to worry.

131
00:08:57,215 --> 00:08:59,410
He was never good
at the flirting thing.

132
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:05,420
What are you talking about?
lt worked with you.

133
00:09:05,657 --> 00:09:06,783
No, you're right.

134
00:09:07,058 --> 00:09:11,586
We met, you flirted and then bam!
Nine years later, you had me.

135
00:09:12,797 --> 00:09:13,991
All right.

136
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:17,292
You know what l'll do?
l'll order another pizza.

137
00:09:17,502 --> 00:09:19,629
And when Caitlin gets here...

138
00:09:19,938 --> 00:09:22,736
...l will show you how well l flirt.

139
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:24,965
l will get her phone number.

140
00:09:25,243 --> 00:09:27,734
And not the one on the menu.

141
00:09:30,748 --> 00:09:33,148
-l found it.
-Thank God! Where was it?

142
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:34,307
On your dresser.

143
00:09:34,586 --> 00:09:37,749
Okay, that is the one we already have.

144
00:09:38,323 --> 00:09:40,621
Here's my big scene.
My big scene's here.

145
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:44,253
-<i>Wanna bet nobody heard anything?</i>
-<i>No bet.</i>

146
00:09:45,497 --> 00:09:46,691
<i>Anybody home?</i>

147
00:09:47,265 --> 00:09:49,028
-Oh, my God.
-What?

148
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,634
Everybody keep smiling. lt'll kill
my grandmother if she finds out.

149
00:09:53,771 --> 00:09:54,760
What is it?

150
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:56,804
They cut me out of the show.

151
00:09:57,842 --> 00:09:59,002
What?

152
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,710
-Are you sure?
-Maybe your scene's coming up.

153
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,108
Not likely. Because you see
that body bag right there?

154
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,642
l'm in it.

155
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,551
This is terrible.
What'll you do?

156
00:10:10,822 --> 00:10:14,053
l don't know. This little
old lady lives for my career.

157
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:17,592
When they dumped me off
<i>Days of Our Lives,</i> she almost died.

158
00:10:17,762 --> 00:10:18,751
That's not good.

159
00:10:18,897 --> 00:10:22,060
-Yeah, we had to get her a home nurse.
-Oh, my God.

160
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,191
Yeah, she almost died
and got really expensive.

161
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:28,968
You're not smiling. Not that face!
Everybody smile!

162
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:33,277
Just tell her what happened.
lt's not your fault.

163
00:10:33,478 --> 00:10:37,141
lf we keep talking this way,
won't we freak her out soon?

164
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:42,685
Soon. l'm gonna be on soon.

165
00:10:42,921 --> 00:10:44,354
There l am!

166
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:48,758
Sam Waterston!

167
00:10:48,993 --> 00:10:51,086
No, no. That's me.
That's me!

168
00:10:51,362 --> 00:10:53,489
No. Sam Waterston.

169
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:56,531
<i>Crime Misdemeanor, Capricorn One.</i>

170
00:10:56,768 --> 00:10:59,828
She doesn't know ''hello,''
but she knows <i>Capricorn One.</i>

171
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,634
l need those earrings.
We're leaving when the show's over.

172
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,974
But l already gave them back to you.

173
00:11:10,148 --> 00:11:11,137
No, you didn't.

174
00:11:11,349 --> 00:11:15,012
l already didn't gave them back to you.
That's what l said.

175
00:11:16,554 --> 00:11:18,044
Where's that other earring?

176
00:11:18,323 --> 00:11:20,450
lt's not here, Pheebs.
lt's not here.

177
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:22,625
l went to Chandler's last night.

178
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:25,318
Make sure you check
Chandler's jewelry box.

179
00:11:27,532 --> 00:11:29,523
Chandler has a jewelry box?

180
00:11:30,034 --> 00:11:33,333
We have 1 0 minutes. Do you
want me to get into that now?

181
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:39,842
Hey, Pheebs.

182
00:11:40,311 --> 00:11:41,710
How's that...

183
00:11:42,013 --> 00:11:45,312
...vegetarian pizza
working out for you?

184
00:11:47,352 --> 00:11:49,877
You and those vegetables
have a real...

185
00:11:50,088 --> 00:11:52,147
...thing going on, huh?

186
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:56,723
Why are you being weird?

187
00:11:58,162 --> 00:11:59,652
Do you like it?

188
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:03,890
No. That'd be,
''Why are you being cute?''

189
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,329
Okay. l'm working on my flirting.

190
00:12:07,538 --> 00:12:09,733
l did not get that.

191
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:14,173
So, Monica, do you like
<i>Law and Order</i>?

192
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:15,539
Yeah, it's good.

193
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:18,841
l found out all this stuff about you.
You like <i>Law and Order...</i>

194
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,382
...and you've flirted with every guy
in the tri-state area.

195
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:26,747
Okay, let me get this straight.

196
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,893
lt's okay for you to flirt,
but not for me?

197
00:12:30,094 --> 00:12:31,755
l'm glad we cleared that up.

198
00:12:32,697 --> 00:12:36,360
l'm sorry, but some things are
different for men and women.

199
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:38,363
Teach me about men and women.

200
00:12:38,603 --> 00:12:41,766
l've already taught you
so much already, but whatever.

201
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,538
When you flirt with a guy,
you think, ''No big deal.''

202
00:12:45,777 --> 00:12:49,304
But he thinks, ''Finally!
Somebody who wants to sleep with me.''

203
00:12:49,714 --> 00:12:51,477
-No way!
-lt's true.

204
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,718
-Well, that's pathetic.
-Again, true.

205
00:12:55,753 --> 00:12:58,881
-This goes for all guys?
-All guys that are awake.

206
00:12:59,757 --> 00:13:00,746
We go to sleep.

207
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,951
All guys from the other end of the
world wake up and act the same way.

208
00:13:06,264 --> 00:13:09,131
lt's another commercial
and l still haven't told her.

209
00:13:09,334 --> 00:13:12,235
Joey, this is the last commercial.

210
00:13:12,437 --> 00:13:14,371
-You got 1 0 minutes left.
-l know!

211
00:13:14,572 --> 00:13:16,233
What am l gonna do?

212
00:13:16,674 --> 00:13:18,972
You will not run out
and leave her here.

213
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:23,508
Yeah, all right.

214
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:33,687
Joey's gonna be right back.
Right back?

215
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,954
Meanwhile, let's talk about you.

216
00:13:39,464 --> 00:13:41,455
So you're old and small.

217
00:13:48,906 --> 00:13:50,567
-Did you find it?
-The earring, no.

218
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,232
But l found my sunglasses.

219
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:55,105
l've been looking for these
since last summer.

220
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:58,275
Those are mine.
You borrowed them from me.

221
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:02,283
Okay. Calm down.
Here they are.

222
00:14:06,624 --> 00:14:09,787
-What do we do?
-l don't know. l don't know!

223
00:14:10,027 --> 00:14:12,791
We'll just have
to tell Monica, that's all.

224
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,999
Oh, God! She's gonna kill me.

225
00:14:16,934 --> 00:14:18,959
l could tell her it was all my fault.

226
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,694
Oh, that'd be great.

227
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,168
Mon, could l talk to you?

228
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:27,035
Yeah. What is it?

229
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:30,347
l lost one of your earrings.

230
00:14:30,548 --> 00:14:33,540
l'm sorry. l am so, so sorry.

231
00:14:36,888 --> 00:14:40,517
All right, what can you do?
lf you lost it, you lost it.

232
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:43,727
l'll replace it. l promise.
l feel so terrible.

233
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:46,691
That's fine.
You didn't do it on purpose.

234
00:14:47,064 --> 00:14:48,964
Look at you. Come here.

235
00:14:51,702 --> 00:14:54,796
-You feel better?
-Yeah. You're the best.

236
00:14:55,506 --> 00:14:57,064
Okay, wait a minute.

237
00:14:58,342 --> 00:15:00,139
l can't do this.

238
00:15:00,378 --> 00:15:02,710
Listen, honey,
it's not Phoebe's fault.

239
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,638
She lent me the earrings.

240
00:15:04,882 --> 00:15:08,374
l lost it. l'm so sorry, honey.
l feel terrible too.

241
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:13,182
That is exactly why
l do not lend you stuff!

242
00:15:14,692 --> 00:15:17,593
First, my jewelry.
lf it's not that, it's my sweater.

243
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:20,093
And if it's not that,
it's my sunglasses.

244
00:15:20,364 --> 00:15:22,229
Your sunglasses?

245
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,195
Oh, right.

246
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:27,770
-Pizza.
-Mine, mine, mine!

247
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,668
Okay, here goes.

248
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:34,105
Prepare yourselves
for some class-A flirting.

249
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:35,869
Okay, hold on.

250
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:44,515
lf you really like this girl, l don't
think flirting is the right way--

251
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:47,953
You'll see.

252
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:52,557
What's her name?

253
00:15:53,264 --> 00:15:55,095
Caitlin!

254
00:16:03,608 --> 00:16:06,202
We can't keep eating like this.

255
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,110
lt's $ 1 2.50.

256
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:21,485
Do you make the pizzas in one
of those wood-burning ovens?

257
00:16:23,094 --> 00:16:25,961
No, actually, l think they're gas.

258
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,390
Gas?

259
00:16:30,568 --> 00:16:31,592
lntense.

260
00:16:33,237 --> 00:16:36,764
lf this is how all the Gellers flirt,
we don't have a problem.

261
00:16:39,777 --> 00:16:42,337
You know that smell gas has?

262
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:50,150
They put that in.

263
00:16:51,255 --> 00:16:54,315
-What?
-The gas is odorless.

264
00:16:54,592 --> 00:16:59,086
But they add the smell
so you know when there's a leak.

265
00:17:01,132 --> 00:17:02,326
Well, okay.

266
00:17:04,602 --> 00:17:07,366
A lot of other gas smells.

267
00:17:12,977 --> 00:17:14,342
Oh, the humanity!

268
00:17:17,815 --> 00:17:20,545
Methane smells....

269
00:17:21,786 --> 00:17:25,119
You know what?
Actually, l really should go.

270
00:17:25,323 --> 00:17:28,292
-But l haven't paid you yet.
-That's okay.

271
00:17:28,492 --> 00:17:31,461
You guys have ordered so many
that this one's on me.

272
00:17:39,203 --> 00:17:42,900
Was l talking to her about gas?

273
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:46,840
More so than anything else.

274
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:51,013
l found it interesting.

275
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:54,773
l'm sorry.

276
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:57,080
Don't worry about it.

277
00:17:57,355 --> 00:18:01,416
ln nine years, she and l
will be right there!

278
00:18:07,898 --> 00:18:10,696
l'm gonna clear out
some of these boxes.

279
00:18:18,943 --> 00:18:21,173
What else do they add smell to?

280
00:18:25,716 --> 00:18:27,741
Caitlin! Caitlin!

281
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:29,782
Hi, l'm Rachel.

282
00:18:30,521 --> 00:18:32,386
The people with all the pizza.

283
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,080
Was there a problem?

284
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:36,292
No, they're fine. Great pizza.

285
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,552
But, actually, my friend Ross...

286
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:43,531
...he gets nervous when he's flirting.

287
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:45,229
Oh, my God!

288
00:18:45,436 --> 00:18:47,529
That was flirting?

289
00:18:48,406 --> 00:18:50,101
l know, l know.

290
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:53,572
l'm telling you,
once you get past that part...

291
00:18:53,778 --> 00:18:56,212
...where it feels
like you wanna die...

292
00:18:56,447 --> 00:18:58,415
...he's a really good person.

293
00:18:58,616 --> 00:19:00,880
The guy with the gas?

294
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:04,650
l'm telling you, he's really
sweet and really funny...

295
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:06,948
...and he's just got a good heart.

296
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:11,858
You know, actually, l did think that
he was cute and then he started talking.

297
00:19:12,897 --> 00:19:15,263
See, there you go.

298
00:19:15,433 --> 00:19:19,494
-Besides, l think he really likes you.
-Really?

299
00:19:19,704 --> 00:19:23,663
Well, we have seven people
and 1 0 pizzas. What do you think?

300
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,703
l thought Joey was there.

301
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:32,306
Yeah, no, but just l'm telling you
he's worth a shot.

302
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,783
Well, if he's so great
why don't you go out with him?

303
00:19:38,756 --> 00:19:41,156
Well, you know, at some point...

304
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:45,319
...you and l may need
to have a longer conversation.

305
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:51,890
Hey, Ross?

306
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,464
l just ran into Caitlin
in the hallway.

307
00:19:55,706 --> 00:19:59,472
You must be getting better at
this flirting stuff than l thought.

308
00:19:59,677 --> 00:20:01,770
-What?
-l don't get it, but she wanted me...

309
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:04,244
...to give you her number.

310
00:20:09,186 --> 00:20:10,983
And she just gave you this?

311
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:17,886
Rach, thanks. But l don't need
you doing me any favors.

312
00:20:18,095 --> 00:20:20,563
l didn't.
She thought you were cute.

313
00:20:22,032 --> 00:20:24,227
Well, that l can believe.

314
00:20:26,003 --> 00:20:28,494
Hey, is the show still on?

315
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:29,900
Almost over, man.

316
00:20:30,174 --> 00:20:31,573
Hey, Nonnie.

317
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:33,871
ls that the pope?

318
00:20:36,614 --> 00:20:38,206
Why am l looking?

319
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:41,110
Oh, here l am!
This is my big scene.

320
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:43,617
<i>All right, back off!</i>

321
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:47,386
<i>I got a gun!</i>

322
00:20:47,858 --> 00:20:49,291
<i>I'm not afraid to use it.</i>

323
00:20:50,795 --> 00:20:52,194
That's right, Nonnie.

324
00:20:52,463 --> 00:20:54,897
You couldn't have at least
changed your shirt?

325
00:20:56,767 --> 00:21:00,726
<i>Now, I want a suitcase</i>
<i>filled with $ 1 OO,OOO</i>--

326
00:21:03,274 --> 00:21:05,640
<i>Filled with $ 1 OO,OOO</i>
<i>in small bills.</i>

327
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,037
<i>And if I don't get</i>--
<i>Shoo!</i>

328
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:10,543
<i>And if I don't get it...</i>

329
00:21:12,316 --> 00:21:13,749
<i>...I'll shoot this duck!</i>

330
00:21:14,418 --> 00:21:15,544
Oh, no!

331
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:19,078
<i>I'm coming out!</i>

332
00:21:26,897 --> 00:21:28,626
And she's supposed to buy this?

333
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,968
<i>Ground control to Major Tom</i>

334
00:21:38,242 --> 00:21:40,073
<i>Commencing countdown</i>

335
00:21:40,344 --> 00:21:42,005
<i>Engines</i>

336
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,569
<i>On</i>

337
00:21:50,521 --> 00:21:53,319
That's scenes from next week's show.
Next week.

338
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:57,420
l am definitely gonna watch that.

339
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,494
Do these look the same?

340
00:22:04,702 --> 00:22:06,727
-Definitely.
-Not as each other.
