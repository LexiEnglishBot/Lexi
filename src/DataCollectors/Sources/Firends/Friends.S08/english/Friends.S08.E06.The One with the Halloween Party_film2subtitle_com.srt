1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,295
- Hey, guys, guess what.
- What?

2
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:08,674
I know it's last minute, but we've
decided to have a Halloween party.

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,009
- Oh, good!
- Great!

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,636
- And everybody has to wear costumes.
- Oh, I don't know...

5
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,348
Come on, it'll be fun.

6
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:21,562
Uh, I'll be there. I have to wear a
costume to my classes that day anyway.

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,522
Tell me you're not gonna dress
like a dinosaur.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,441
Pfft, heh.

9
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,359
Not two years in a row.

10
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:32,781
- I'll come, but I'm not dressing up.
- You have to.

11
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:38,746
No. Halloween is stupid. Dressing up,
pretending to be someone you're not.

12
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:40,706
You're an actor.

13
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,959
Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?

14
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,046
- Yeah. Yeah, I will.
- The girl from their wedding?

15
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,464
- Yeah.
- Wow, hey.

16
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:52,718
If she needs any ideas for costumes,
she could be a, uh, bikini model...

17
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,596
...or a slutty nurse,
or a sexy cheerleader.

18
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:59,016
Or, ooh, ooh. Leatherface
from Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

19
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,686
No, no, no! Slutty Leatherface.

20
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:06,982
Wasn't Joey hitting on her
at the wedding too?

21
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,194
That's right, he was hitting on her.

22
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:15,115
And I got her. I guess
the better man won. Heh.

23
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,077
Please don't take her from me.

24
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,830
- Ursula!
- Oh. Heh.

25
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,582
Wait. It's me, Phoebe.

26
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,502
Oh, I thought there was a mirror there.
Okay. Bye.

27
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,629
Wait a second!

28
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,923
Um, so, what's new with you?

29
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:16,844
Um, nothing. I mean,
I'm getting married next week.

30
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,762
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

31
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,057
It's gonna be a small ceremony.
Just family.

32
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,517
His.

33
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,185
Huh.

34
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,687
Okay.

35
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,522
I'm really happy for you.

36
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:33,735
Wait. If, um... If you want to come,
I guess that'd be okay.

37
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,529
- Really?
- Sure, why not?

38
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,990
You could be my "sister" for the day.

39
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,868
Yeah, heh, okay.

40
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,745
Um, you know, my friends are having
a Halloween party tonight...

41
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,415
...at my old apartment,
so you could come.

42
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,834
Maybe I could meet the guy
you're marrying.

43
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,087
Well, I'm supposed
to be working tonight.

44
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,340
I'm supposed to be working now,
so who cares!

45
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,345
- By the way, it's a costume party.
- Oh, okay, so that's why you're...

46
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,764
No.

47
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,850
But thanks.

48
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,358
- Hi.
- You're supposed to wear a costume.

49
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,569
I am. I am a woman...

50
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,780
...who spent a lot of money on a dress
and she wants to wear it...

51
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,825
...because soon
she won't be able to fit into it.

52
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,911
- Oh. I'm Catwoman.
- Ah.

53
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,288
Who wants the dress
when you're too big for it.

54
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,789
Okay.

55
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,335
- Trick or treat!
- Oh! Can I give out candy?

56
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,045
I really want to be with kids.

57
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,465
Ever since I got pregnant,
I have the strongest maternal instincts.

58
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,635
- Trick or treat!
- Just a minute!

59
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,476
We... Aah! Look at you guys!

60
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:52,481
- Wow! You are a very scary witch.
- Thank you.

61
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:56,360
- And you are a very funny clown.
- Thank you.

62
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,903
And you...

63
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,280
...are so in style right now.

64
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,408
You know, I work at Ralph Lauren.

65
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:07,412
The whole fall line has got
this equestrian theme going on.

66
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,208
- Did you see the cover of Vogue...?
- Could I just have the candy?

67
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,213
Yeah. Sure.

68
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,807
Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again.

69
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,060
So we do, Supergirl.

70
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,230
It's me, Phoebe.

71
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,235
Monica, can I talk to you
for a second?

72
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,076
Listen, I appreciate
you getting the costume.

73
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,494
Oh, you did this to him?

74
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,539
What? I thought he'd love it.

75
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,791
His favorite book
was The Velveteen Rabbit.

76
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,419
The Velveteen Rabbit
was brown and white.

77
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,339
It was either a pink bunny,
or no bunny at all.

78
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,134
No bunny at all.
Always no bunny at all!

79
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,097
- Hey.
- You didn't dress up either?

80
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,975
Yes, I did. I'm Chandler.

81
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,648
Dude, what happened?

82
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,569
- How is that me?
- Okay, ahem.

83
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,737
I'm Chandler.

84
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:26,658
- Ha, ha! That is so you!
- Ha-ha-ha.

85
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,911
- When have I ever done that?
- When have I ever done that?

86
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,044
- Trick or treat.
- Oh!

87
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:43,842
Oh, you're just the prettiest ballerina
ever I've ever seen.

88
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,053
Thank you.

89
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,014
Oh, wow. That deserves another candy.

90
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,433
- Thank you.
- Ha-ha-ha.

91
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:57,105
I have to say,
that earns "two-two" pieces of candy.

92
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,066
I love you!

93
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,651
Oh! Aw...

94
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,779
Oh, honey, here, take it all.

95
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,370
Monica? We need more candy.

96
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,414
- What? There's only been four kids.
- I know.

97
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:18,168
But one said she loved me,
so I gave her everything.

98
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,337
No wonder you're pregnant.

99
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,883
- Hey.
- Hey.

100
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:31,098
- What are you supposed to be?
- Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik?

101
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:37,646
Well, I'm a potato. Or a "spud"...

102
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,899
...and these are my antenna.

103
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,194
So Sputnik becomes?

104
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,827
Spud-nik! Spud-nik.

105
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,081
Wow, I don't have
the worst costume anymore.

106
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,503
Hey, all right! Ross came as doodie.

107
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:07,342
- No, I'm not doodie.
- No, space-doodie.

108
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,853
- God!
- Hey, sweetie.

109
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,983
- Aren't you gonna give me a kiss?
- Okay, I will.

110
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,485
But right after, you have to tell me
who you are.

111
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,989
- Ursula?
- Ursula's fiancé?

112
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,866
- Oh, my God. You're the sister.
- Yeah.

113
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:34,536
- I just slapped my future sister-in-law's ass.
- Yeah.

114
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:38,165
I'm an idiot. Is your mother here?
I could give her a slap on the butt.

115
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,960
- My mother killed herself.
- See, and I knew that.

116
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,047
Now I'm sweating.

117
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:51,761
I'm really sweating. Now I'm saying look
at me, I'm even sweatier. I should go.

118
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,805
No. We'll start over.

119
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,766
- Hi, I'm Phoebe.
- Eric.

120
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,728
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- The sweat's in my eyes.

121
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,563
- It's burning.
- Okay.

122
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,023
- Thank you.
- There.

123
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,067
- So, what are you?
- I don't think they have a name for it.

124
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,403
I get nervous, and I sweat like crazy.

125
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:15,494
- No, I meant your costume.
- Oh, um, I'm a solar system.

126
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,913
My student's helped me.
I teach second grade.

127
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,916
- I love the second grade.
- Really?

128
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,127
It's better than first grade,
where you don't know what's going on.

129
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,922
And definitely better than third grade.

130
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,759
You know, with all the politics
and the mind games.

131
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:35,764
- So, what do you do?
- I'm a masseuse, by day.

132
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,727
- You don't have to stand here with me.
- I'm having fun.

133
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:46,149
- I'm really excited for you and Ursula.
- I feel very lucky. She's great.

134
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:50,445
- She's the most beautiful woman ever.
- Thank you.

135
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,828
- Hey, Joey?
- Yeah?

136
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,374
- You read comic books, right?
- Exclusively.

137
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:06,670
Who do you think would win in a fight,
Catwoman or Supergirl?

138
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,089
- Catwoman, hands down.
- Yeah.

139
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,592
Between you and Phoebe?
I'd give the edge to Phoebe.

140
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,719
- What? Really?
- You kidding?

141
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:20,642
Phoebe lived on the street, okay?
Plus, she's got this crazy temper. She...

142
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,978
She's not right behind me, is she?

143
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,105
- No, you're fine.
- Okay.

144
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:28,483
- Do you think I could take Rachel?
- I'm not sure.

145
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,986
What? Come on, I am tough!

146
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,072
Punch me here, as hard as you can!

147
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,617
Relax. What are you taking this
so seriously for? It doesn't matter.

148
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:42,831
Really? What would you say if I told you
Ross or Chandler could beat you up?

149
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,208
I would say, "Woman, please."

150
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,547
Hey, Ursula's fiancé is really sweet.

151
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,258
He's a teacher,
he does volunteer work.

152
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:59,222
Normally, I don't like sweaty guys.
But I could just mop him up.

153
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,684
- Oh, my God, Phoebe?
- What?

154
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,894
You're getting a crush
on your sister's fiancé.

155
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,605
No, I'm not, you are!

156
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,150
Here comes the temper.

157
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,488
- Trick or treat.
- Hi.

158
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:19,826
Hi. Know what? We're out of candy.
But someone went to get some.

159
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:24,914
And I've been giving out money,
but I'm out of that too.

160
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,459
- Can I write you a check?
- Okay.

161
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,463
- Okay. What's your name?
- Lelani Mayolanofavich.

162
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,260
Okay, I'm just gonna write this out
to "cash."

163
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,723
- Hi.
- Hi, Mona.

164
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,892
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

165
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,562
Joey's gonna be thrilled. He was hoping
you'd come by as a slutty nurse.

166
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,274
Um, actually, I'm just a nurse.

167
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:56,780
You'd think that would embarrass me,
but, you see, I'm maxed out.

168
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,617
- Hey, you made it.
- Hi! Wait.

169
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:05,163
- You're, um... You're a potato?
- Well, I'm a spud?

170
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,956
And the antenna...

171
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,751
- Oh, my God, you're Spud-nik!
- Yes!

172
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,212
Marry her.

173
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,632
Okay, here's a good one for you.

174
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,593
Who do you think would win a fight
between Ross and Chandler?

175
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,262
I can't answer that.
Chandler's my husband.

176
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,932
- So Ross?
- Yeah.

177
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,435
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hello, handsome.

178
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,937
Oh, God.

179
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,942
Aw, look at you two.
So when did you guys meet?

180
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,569
- Two weeks ago.
- Two weeks, that's it?

181
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:40,573
I know. It sounds crazy, and it's not
like me to do something impulsive.

182
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,660
But she's so perfect,
and we have so much in common.

183
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,911
Oh, really?

184
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,497
- We're both teachers.
- Huh?

185
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,377
- And we were both in the Peace Corps.
- Peace Corps, really?

186
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,799
In fact, when we were
building houses in Uruguay...

187
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,386
...we were just two towns apart
and we never met.

188
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:05,515
Yeah. It wasn't a town when I got
there, but it was a town when I left.

189
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,854
- Shall we get me really drunk?
- Sure.

190
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,482
Ha, ha. Ugh.

191
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,695
Howdy, doodie.

192
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,822
That's funny, yeah.

193
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,869
You're the funniest man here in a
bunny costume his wife made him wear.

194
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:30,540
Relax, man. Relax.
You're looking a little flushed.

195
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,339
Hey, I think we might find out
the answer to our question.

196
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:41,634
- What question?
- Who could kick whose ass in a fight...

197
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:42,886
...you or Ross?

198
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,056
- There's no question.
- So you think Ross too?

199
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,353
- You picked Ross?
- Ross is really strong.

200
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:56,691
He's the strongest out of all three
of you. Except for Joey.

201
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:02,864
- I can not believe you didn't pick me.
- In her defense, she's right. I am stronger.

202
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,116
I would destroy you.

203
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:09,996
Oh, really? You think you're stronger?
Why don't you prove it?

204
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,666
Oh, I'll prove it.
I'll prove it like a theorem!

205
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:17,128
All right! Okay, stop it. Stop it!

206
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,380
Stop! No one's gonna fight.

207
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:23,218
People came to see a fight,
let's give them what they came for!

208
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:29,682
- You guys could arm-wrestle.
- Yeah, listen to the slutty nurse.

209
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,394
- You're going down.
- Oh, yeah? You're going further down.

210
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,771
Downtown!

211
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,899
Seriously, guys,
the trash talk is embarrassing.

212
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,911
Oh, Gunther, you brought candy.
Thank you so much for picking this up.

213
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,997
- You are so sweet.
- Really?

214
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:57,210
Someday, you are gonna make some man
the luckiest guy in the world.

215
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,089
- Got to go.
- Trick or treat.

216
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:05,176
Hi! Wow! There you go.

217
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,721
My friend Lewis told me
you were giving out money.

218
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,309
Oh, yeah, we were,
but, um, now we've got candy.

219
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:16,604
I'd rather have the money.

220
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,650
Well, that's not your choice.
Happy Halloween!

221
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,193
This isn't fair.

222
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,780
Is it fair that all you did was put on a cape
and I gotta give you stuff?

223
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,949
Shut up!

224
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,742
You shut up!

225
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:35,790
- You can't tell me to shut up.
- Uh, I think I just did.

226
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,376
And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!

227
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,546
- Uh, Rach.
- No, I got it. I'm good. I got it.

228
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,134
Wait, I had one more thing to say.

229
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,927
Oh, right. Shut up.

230
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,722
You're a mean old woman.

231
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,765
Oh, wait! No. Shut... Don't cry!

232
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,059
Let me get my checkbook!

233
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,395
Honey, you don't have to do this.

234
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,440
It's the strength you have inside
that means the most to me.

235
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:04,903
You're loyal, you're honest
and you have integrity.

236
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,156
That's the strength I want
in the man I love.

237
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,451
That means nothing to me. Come on!

238
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,077
Ugh.

239
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,204
- Hi, liar.
- Hey.

240
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,499
You know, the only reason
he's marrying you...

241
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,878
...is because he thinks the things
you were saying were true.

242
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,631
- They could be true.
- But they're not.

243
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,216
Yeah. It's a fine line, huh?

244
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,012
- Why are you lying to him?
- I don't know.

245
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:36,017
He said he did this stuff, I said I did it
too. He got so excited, it was fun.

246
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,310
Honey?

247
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:42,357
It's a disgusting habit,
and I want you to quit now!

248
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,193
She's helped so many people
quit smoking.

249
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,695
We'd better get going.

250
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,823
- You have a church group meeting.
- Right.

251
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,081
- Well, it was nice meeting you.
- You too.

252
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,961
And, Ursula, it was really nice
meeting you tonight!

253
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,130
Pheebs, come on! Bunny versus Doodie.
We're waiting!

254
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:12,595
Okay, guys. One match,
winner take all.

255
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,265
Wait. What does the winner get?

256
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,309
- Pride.
- And dignity.

257
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,187
Heh. Okay, if you say so.

258
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,398
All right, ready, set, go!

259
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,734
Come on!

260
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,830
- Wow, they're both really strong.
- Or equally weak.

261
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,834
Oh, God. Chandler's making
his sex face.

262
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:53,720
- So you getting tired?
- No. I could do this all day.

263
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,264
Yeah. Me too.

264
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,561
- Getting a little tired, though.
- God, I'm exhausted.

265
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:07,859
This is starting to look bad for me,
okay? Mona's standing right there.

266
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:13,114
Oh, God, she's talking to Joey!
You've got to let me win!

267
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,075
No way. Let me win.
My wife thinks I'm a wimp.

268
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,827
Hey, at least you have a wife.

269
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,622
I keep getting divorces
and knocking people up.

270
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,294
And I'm dressed as doodie.

271
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:32,300
- You're Spud-nik.
- Come on, who we kidding? I'm doodie.

272
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,095
- Please? She's watching.
- Ugh.

273
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,474
- Fine.
- Thanks.

274
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,061
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah!

275
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,812
Yay!

276
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,731
My hero!

277
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,232
You're a weird lady.

278
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,448
- Hey, Ursula said she left her purse.
- Oh.

279
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:59,410
What a relief. It has the numbers
of the people in her prayer chain.

280
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,204
I'm sure it does. Yeah. Yeah.

281
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,748
Well, guess I'll see you at the wedding.

282
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:10,046
Um, listen. I don't think I'm gonna
make it to the wedding.

283
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:14,008
- I wish you all the luck in the world.
- We'll be okay.

284
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:18,513
It's so perfect,
and she's been saving herself for me.

285
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:24,310
- I can't let you do this. She's lying to you.
- What?

286
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:28,689
She is lying. And I bet
I could prove it. Excuse me.

287
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:32,193
Okay. Yeah, not a prayer chain.

288
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:36,322
But what looks like a detailed drawing
of a bank floor plan.

289
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:42,995
Here's the name tag from the restaurant
where she works as a waitress.

290
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,540
Not a teacher, a waitress.

291
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,668
Here's her driver's license.
She always lies about this.

292
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,963
- How old did she say she was?
- She told me she was 25.

293
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,882
Aw. I almost don't want to show you this.

294
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,428
Just remember, I'm a minute younger.

295
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,641
I am so stupid.

296
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,811
Of course she's lying.
She's not a teacher.

297
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:12,483
There's no such thing as a "Top Secret
School for the Children of Spies."

298
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,863
No, you're not stupid.

299
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,823
I'm not smart.

300
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:27,915
I just wanted so much
to be impulsive for once.

301
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,293
- To be romantic.
- That's good.

302
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,838
You should be impulsive
and you should be romantic.

303
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,215
Just, you did it with the wrong person.

304
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,722
- What?
- It's weird, two people look so alike.

305
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,515
And so different.

306
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,145
Eric! Let's go!

307
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:54,192
- Better go deal with it.
- Yeah, you should.

308
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,783
Hurry up! I gotta pray!

309
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,086
- Hey.
- Hey.

310
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,381
Well, I had to give the kid
50 bucks to stop crying.

311
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,719
- That's not so bad.
- I also had to go to a couple houses...

312
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,763
...as his girlfriend.

313
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:27,141
Ugh, I am just awful with children.

314
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:31,729
Come on, you're good with kids.
They're just crazy on Halloween.

315
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,649
They're all greedy,
hopped up on sugar.

316
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,402
- Really? That's all it is?
- Absolutely.

317
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:45,076
Halloween is the worst. Except
for Christmas. And their birthdays.

318
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,412
They get crazy during the summer too.

319
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,124
And any time they're
hungry or sleepy.

320
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,585
Kids are tough.
Good luck with that. Pfft.

321
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,510
Look, I wanted to tell you,
I'm sorry you lost.

322
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:06,472
Oh, listen. I got a secret for you.
I let him win.

323
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,850
- Heh, heh.
- Was that a secret, or a lie?

324
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,353
- No, I let him... Ross?
- Yeah?

325
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,730
Would you tell her
I let you win, please?

326
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,150
Oh, yeah, uh, Chandler let me win.

327
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,156
No, Chandler's really strong.
Oh, my arm is so sore. Oh, nurse?

328
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,120
I am strong. I'll show you.

329
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,913
Chandler, please.

330
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,999
Oh, what's the matter? Are you scared?

331
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,584
Let's go, big bunny!

332
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,338
One, two, three. Go!

333
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,096
I'm gonna kill myself.
