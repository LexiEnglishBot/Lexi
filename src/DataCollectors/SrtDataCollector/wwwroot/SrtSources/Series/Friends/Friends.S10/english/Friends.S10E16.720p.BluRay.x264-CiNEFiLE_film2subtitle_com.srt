1
00:00:02,407 --> 00:00:04,742
All right, let's play one more time, okay?

2
00:00:04,909 --> 00:00:07,954
And remember, if I win,
you do not move to Paris.

3
00:00:08,121 --> 00:00:11,249
Okay. I can't believe
I'm risking this again, but you're on.

4
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:15,044
All right, Joe, you remember the rules.
Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.

5
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:16,588
Just flip.

6
00:00:18,298 --> 00:00:20,467
- Tails!
- Damn it!

7
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:24,721
So we thought we'd throw you
a little going-away party around 7.

8
00:00:24,888 --> 00:00:26,473
Oh, that sounds good.

9
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:29,642
Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow.
Shouldn't you be packing?

10
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:32,395
- It's all done.
- Oh, yeah, right.

11
00:00:32,562 --> 00:00:36,983
And after I took a shower this morning,
I just threw my towel on the floor.

12
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,069
- Oh, God, it hurts to even joke about it.
- I know.

13
00:00:40,445 --> 00:00:44,282
Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage
that I'm taking is in the bedroom.

14
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:48,119
This is Emma's Paris stuff. These are
the boxes that I'm having shipped...

15
00:00:48,286 --> 00:00:50,580
...and that's the sandwich
I made for the plane.

16
00:00:50,747 --> 00:00:53,082
- Okay, you've done some good work.
- Yeah.

17
00:00:53,249 --> 00:00:54,626
What about your carry-ons?

18
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:58,004
Oh, well, everything that I need
is in here...

19
00:00:58,171 --> 00:01:00,632
...and my travel documents
are on the counter...

20
00:01:00,798 --> 00:01:03,885
...organized in the order
that I will be needing them.

21
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:07,680
Oh, my God.
I have nothing left to teach you.

22
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:13,144
- Where's your passport?
- It should be next to my plane ticket.

23
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:16,606
- Well, it's not.
- What? Maybe I put it in here?

24
00:01:16,773 --> 00:01:19,359
Oh! Oh, it's not in there!

25
00:01:19,526 --> 00:01:22,111
Oh, no, I must have packed it
in one of these boxes!

26
00:01:22,403 --> 00:01:25,281
- Here, let me help you.
- Shoot.

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,743
I can't believe I did this.

28
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,622
At what point did it stop being funny
that I took her passport?

29
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,634
Oh, wow, can you believe
you're only three weeks away?

30
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:28,136
I know.

31
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:32,056
- You don't mind me touching your belly?
- I don't mind you touching my belly...

32
00:02:32,223 --> 00:02:35,310
...but your hand's kind of blocking the
part where the baby's gonna come out.

33
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:40,231
- Hey!
- Hey.

34
00:02:40,398 --> 00:02:44,986
Hi, Erica. Welcome back to town.
Wow, look how big you've gotten.

35
00:02:45,153 --> 00:02:47,238
That's because I'm pregnant.

36
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:50,950
- Right. No, I understand.
- Oh, okay.

37
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:54,704
I'm just always afraid that people think
I'm just fat with big breasts.

38
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:57,498
No, no, I knew.

39
00:03:01,336 --> 00:03:04,714
- Okay, well, stop staring at them.
- She brought them up.

40
00:03:06,591 --> 00:03:08,760
I didn't realize
you were coming back so soon.

41
00:03:08,926 --> 00:03:11,054
In a couple weeks
I won't be able to travel.

42
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,641
I wanted her to get to know the doctors
and get settled into the hotel.

43
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:19,103
- Why isn't she staying with you guys?
- Because we're moving in a couple days.

44
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,441
Plus, hotels are fun! My room has
this little fridge full of free snacks.

45
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:26,444
Erica, those things aren't free.

46
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:29,739
In fact, they have one of the highest
markups of any consumer product...

47
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:33,826
Ross, she's giving us her baby.
She can eat you if she wants.

48
00:03:35,453 --> 00:03:37,538
I'll be right back.

49
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,919
Oh, man, I can't believe you guys
are leaving this place.

50
00:03:43,086 --> 00:03:45,630
I know. I know.

51
00:03:45,797 --> 00:03:49,384
You know, you could take it if you want.
The lease is still in Nana's name.

52
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:53,304
No, no. This will always be your place.
It would be too sad.

53
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:55,890
Plus, how much a month does it cost
to feed Joey?

54
00:03:56,057 --> 00:03:57,350
Yeah, it takes two incomes.

55
00:03:58,393 --> 00:04:00,645
Hey, is Chandler here?
We talked about catching a movie.

56
00:04:00,812 --> 00:04:02,397
Oh, no, he doesn't have time for that.

57
00:04:02,563 --> 00:04:04,982
You can go help him and Joey
pack up the guest room.

58
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:08,820
Hmm. Packing.
Sexy cheerleader comedy.

59
00:04:08,986 --> 00:04:13,700
Hmm. Helpful brother.
Creepy loner at teen movie.

60
00:04:15,284 --> 00:04:17,161
(Creep)'

61
00:04:25,086 --> 00:04:29,173
- What are you guys doing?
- Try it. I can't feel a thing.

62
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:38,349
Are you kidding?

63
00:04:39,976 --> 00:04:42,228
- This is packing?
- We're taking a break.

64
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:43,896
From?

65
00:04:44,063 --> 00:04:45,982
Jumping on the bed.

66
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:50,278
All right, Rachel's party is in a couple
of hours, and there's a lot to do.

67
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:53,489
Ross, you've got Geller blood.
You're in charge of these yahoos.

68
00:04:53,656 --> 00:04:55,116
- You got it.
- All right.

69
00:04:55,283 --> 00:04:57,493
She's right. We gotta get serious.

70
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,663
Let's put Styrofoam peanuts
down his pants and kick him!

71
00:05:02,623 --> 00:05:06,461
No, guys, she's right. We should get
to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet.

72
00:05:06,627 --> 00:05:10,131
Joey, you pack them, and Ross,
you repack whatever Joey packs.

73
00:05:14,677 --> 00:05:16,137
You guys hear a ringing?

74
00:05:18,055 --> 00:05:23,603
- What the hell is this?
- Hey, handcuffs. And fur-lined. Nice.

75
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,147
I didn't know you guys had it in you.

76
00:05:27,023 --> 00:05:29,942
Chandler, you don't have a sister,
so you can't understand...

77
00:05:30,109 --> 00:05:32,820
...how much this bums me out.

78
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:36,032
I didn't know Monica had these.

79
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,328
Maybe she used them
with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard.

80
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,334
Why would she use them with Richard
and not me? I can be kinky.

81
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:51,547
I once did a naked dance for her
with scarves.

82
00:05:54,175 --> 00:05:56,219
Bumming hard, guys. Bumming hard.

83
00:06:04,227 --> 00:06:05,269
- Hey.
- Hey. Where's Mike?

84
00:06:05,436 --> 00:06:06,854
Oh, he has a gig.

85
00:06:07,021 --> 00:06:09,857
It's kind of like being married
to a rock star, you know?

86
00:06:10,024 --> 00:06:12,109
My husband has a gig.

87
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:14,570
Yeah? Where is it?

88
00:06:14,737 --> 00:06:18,950
Oh, he's playing organ
for a children's roller-skating party.

89
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,328
Rock on!

90
00:06:23,412 --> 00:06:26,207
Wow, this is quite a spread.
What is all this stuff?

91
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:29,710
Well, I thought this would be a great
opportunity to use up all the food...

92
00:06:29,877 --> 00:06:32,296
...that I don't want to move
to the new house with me.

93
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:38,052
So enjoy. Smoked oyster casserole
with a breakfast-cereal crust.

94
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:45,059
Kidney beans in their own juices,
and for dessert, a questionable orange.

95
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,645
- Hey.
- Hey.

96
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,939
- Where's Rach?
- She's putting Emma down.

97
00:06:50,106 --> 00:06:53,109
She'll be over in a second.
It just hit her that she's leaving.

98
00:06:53,276 --> 00:06:56,529
She's kind of emotional, no one
say anything to set her off, okay?

99
00:06:56,737 --> 00:06:57,780
Yeah.

100
00:06:58,614 --> 00:06:59,949
Hey, Rach. Hey.

101
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:02,076
There she is.

102
00:07:02,493 --> 00:07:04,787
Hi, you guys.

103
00:07:05,204 --> 00:07:06,747
What did I just say?

104
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:11,502
Oh, no, no, no, it's okay. It's okay.
I'm gonna be fine.

105
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:14,255
- Come, I'll make you a drink.
- Okay.

106
00:07:15,298 --> 00:07:17,967
Oh, man, I can't believe
she's actually leaving.

107
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:19,969
How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?

108
00:07:20,344 --> 00:07:22,763
I know, she's been
such a big part of my life.

109
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,600
It feels like when Melrose Place
got canceled.

110
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:31,689
I mean...

111
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:35,109
Ah, forget it, I miss Melrose Place.

112
00:07:36,694 --> 00:07:39,155
- I had a chance to stop her too.
- Yeah?

113
00:07:39,322 --> 00:07:42,992
Who loses 57 coin tosses in a row?
You know?

114
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:46,120
Heads, she wins. Tails, I lose.

115
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:52,752
Wait a minute.

116
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:57,131
- Yes, Joe?
- I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning.

117
00:08:00,635 --> 00:08:02,845
So you doing okay?

118
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:06,515
Well, I've been better.
You guys are gonna come visit, right?

119
00:08:06,682 --> 00:08:10,061
Yes. You know, in six months,
the statute of limitations runs out...

120
00:08:10,227 --> 00:08:13,022
...and I can travel internationally again.

121
00:08:14,941 --> 00:08:18,319
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- I know.

122
00:08:19,153 --> 00:08:22,198
You know what? Um, I have some
goodbye stuff that I wanted to say...

123
00:08:22,365 --> 00:08:27,495
...to each of you. And I was gonna save it
till the end of the night, but come here.

124
00:08:29,914 --> 00:08:32,458
Hey, what do you think
they're doing in there?

125
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:34,377
If I had to guess, I'd say...

126
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:38,172
...Rachel's putting on the bubble wrap,
and Phoebe's doing the punching.

127
00:08:41,717 --> 00:08:43,928
Pheebs, I don't even know
where to start.

128
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:46,138
- Okay, well, before you do...
- Uh-huh.

129
00:08:46,305 --> 00:08:48,683
I know we weren't supposed
to get you presents...

130
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:52,103
- ...but I do have something for you.
- Oh! Oh!

131
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:53,604
Oh.

132
00:08:53,771 --> 00:08:55,856
- What is it?
- Well, it's a cotton swab...

133
00:08:56,023 --> 00:08:57,817
...with a bit of my saliva on it...

134
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,239
...so that if they perfect the cloning
process while you're over there...

135
00:09:03,406 --> 00:09:06,659
...you can use the DNA
to create your own Pheebs.

136
00:09:10,788 --> 00:09:12,623
I'm gonna throw this away...

137
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,129
...but thank you so much
for the gesture.

138
00:09:19,422 --> 00:09:21,090
Chandler?

139
00:09:21,257 --> 00:09:25,469
Um, I was just in our bedroom,
and I found these on my pillow.

140
00:09:26,387 --> 00:09:29,265
Oh, yes, I decided to leave those
out for you in case Richard stops by...

141
00:09:29,432 --> 00:09:33,561
...and you want to engage in a little
light bondage and mustache play.

142
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:36,897
What are you talking about?
These aren't mine.

143
00:09:37,064 --> 00:09:38,274
Oh, yeah, right!

144
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:41,402
Good luck getting another scarf dance
from me.

145
00:09:42,486 --> 00:09:44,905
That would be a terrible punishment.

146
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:48,868
But I'm serious,
I've never seen these before.

147
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:52,079
Really? Then what are they doing
in our guest room?

148
00:09:52,413 --> 00:09:54,206
Rachel used to live in that room.

149
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:57,960
Rachel. With handcuffs.

150
00:09:58,127 --> 00:09:59,795
Interesting.

151
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:02,048
Joey's bare ass.

152
00:10:06,135 --> 00:10:07,219
Well played.

153
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:16,604
- I love you, Phoebe.
- I love you too.

154
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,524
Please...

155
00:10:20,691 --> 00:10:22,026
Please don't...

156
00:10:22,193 --> 00:10:25,780
Don't turn into, you know,
a French bitch.

157
00:10:26,447 --> 00:10:28,115
I won't.

158
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:32,828
All right. Well, if I'm gonna do this,
I better keep going.

159
00:10:32,995 --> 00:10:34,330
- Okay.
- Okay.

160
00:10:34,497 --> 00:10:35,831
- Monica?
- Yeah?

161
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:38,959
- Will you come with me?
- Sure.

162
00:10:40,503 --> 00:10:42,963
- Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
- No.

163
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,174
Oh, you're so screwed.

164
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:51,972
H93'-

165
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:53,474
What was that all about?

166
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:57,144
She's gonna say goodbye
to each of us individually.

167
00:10:57,853 --> 00:10:59,939
Are you kidding? Oh, my God.

168
00:11:00,106 --> 00:11:03,651
Yeah, I know.
It's gonna be even worse for you. God.

169
00:11:03,818 --> 00:11:06,445
Well, just get ready
to do some serious crying.

170
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:10,032
Man, I'm not gonna be able
to handle this.

171
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:15,162
Now I know how my students feel
at the end of each year.

172
00:11:16,122 --> 00:11:20,835
And why they act out
by giving me such bad evaluations.

173
00:11:24,672 --> 00:11:26,882
Mon. Okay.

174
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:31,345
I better just say what it is
I'm gonna say.

175
00:11:34,223 --> 00:11:39,186
None of the amazing things that have
happened to me in the last 10 years...

176
00:11:39,353 --> 00:11:41,647
...would have happened
if it wasn't for you.

177
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:48,362
No one has been
more like a sister to me.

178
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,614
I know what you mean.

179
00:11:50,781 --> 00:11:52,533
You're like a sister to me too.

180
00:11:58,164 --> 00:12:01,876
I don't know what
I'm going to do without you.

181
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,213
You're the greatest friend I ever had.

182
00:12:06,714 --> 00:12:10,217
...Seeing you every day.

183
00:12:11,594 --> 00:12:13,262
What?

184
00:12:16,765 --> 00:12:20,352
...See you every day!

185
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:22,938
That is so sweet!

186
00:12:29,486 --> 00:12:31,655
Oh, no, she took down Monica.

187
00:12:33,324 --> 00:12:35,701
And I'm the crier in the family.

188
00:12:37,411 --> 00:12:39,246
Oh, God, I could be next.

189
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,416
Maybe she won't talk to me if it
looks like we're in conversation.

190
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,461
- Okay.
- That thing you said about the thing...

191
00:12:45,628 --> 00:12:48,130
...it really made me think
about that other thing.

192
00:12:48,297 --> 00:12:51,050
- Rash?
- Oh, it's okay, Chandler's talking to her.

193
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:53,594
I really made you think
about that thing, huh?

194
00:12:57,973 --> 00:13:02,186
Uh, Rach, I think I have something
that belongs to you.

195
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:11,612
Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending
to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.

196
00:13:12,947 --> 00:13:16,492
No, no, they're really yours.
We found them in your old room.

197
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:19,411
Well, these aren't mine.
Maybe Monica used to use them with...

198
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:21,163
Don't say Richard.

199
00:13:22,957 --> 00:13:26,460
Well, if they're not Monica's and
they're not yours, then whose are they?

200
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:29,922
I think you're forgetting the kinkiest
former resident of that room.

201
00:13:30,464 --> 00:13:32,800
- Pheebs!
- Yeah!

202
00:13:34,969 --> 00:13:36,595
I think these are yours.

203
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,101
These are not mine.
Look how flimsy they are. Come on.

204
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:47,147
My God, you try to hang a guy
from a water pipe with these...

205
00:13:47,314 --> 00:13:50,401
...they'll snap like a piece of licorice.

206
00:13:51,485 --> 00:13:54,280
- Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
- Sure.

207
00:13:57,491 --> 00:14:01,161
You don't really handcuff guys
to water pipes do you?

208
00:14:01,328 --> 00:14:04,081
Where do you think Mike really is?

209
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:14,466
Oh, honey...

210
00:14:14,633 --> 00:14:17,594
Let me just saying something
because once we get into this...

211
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:21,682
...I'm gonna get all uncomfortable
and probably make some stupid joke.

212
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:26,645
I just want to say that I... I love you.

213
00:14:28,522 --> 00:14:31,108
And I'm gonna miss you.

214
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:34,486
And I'm so sad that you're leaving.

215
00:14:37,072 --> 00:14:39,241
Oh, you know what?

216
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:42,745
Let's not say anything else.

217
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:44,621
I love you.

218
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,333
Not so tight.

219
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,589
- I'm sorry, give me one more chance.
- Okay.

220
00:14:53,756 --> 00:14:55,424
Okay.

221
00:14:57,384 --> 00:14:59,887
- Oh!
- I'm sorry. Just go. Just go.

222
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:01,972
I can't. I can't.

223
00:15:07,394 --> 00:15:10,314
- So I guess you're next. You ready?
- I don't think so.

224
00:15:10,481 --> 00:15:14,151
Oh, you're definitely not.
I haven't cried like that in years.

225
00:15:14,318 --> 00:15:16,612
You cried yesterday at the 6:00 news.

226
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:20,157
That old woman was being scammed
by her mechanic.

227
00:15:21,617 --> 00:15:24,787
God, I can't believe
she saved me for last.

228
00:15:24,953 --> 00:15:26,705
Why are they taking so long?

229
00:15:26,872 --> 00:15:27,998
I don't know.

230
00:15:28,165 --> 00:15:31,460
But, God, Joey seems to be handling
it surprisingly well.

231
00:15:34,963 --> 00:15:37,132
No!

232
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,226
Okay, here we go.

233
00:15:50,437 --> 00:15:53,190
- Well...
- Yeah.

234
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:56,360
I think I'm gonna take off.

235
00:15:59,655 --> 00:16:00,697
Huh?

236
00:16:00,864 --> 00:16:05,077
Oh, you guys, this was an amazing night.
Thank you so much.

237
00:16:05,244 --> 00:16:06,870
I love you.

238
00:16:07,037 --> 00:16:08,705
Good night.

239
00:16:12,751 --> 00:16:14,420
What?

240
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:19,842
I don't get a goodbye?

241
00:16:20,008 --> 00:16:21,927
Lucky bastard.

242
00:16:29,518 --> 00:16:32,896
Unbelievable.
She says goodbye to everyone but me!

243
00:16:33,063 --> 00:16:36,442
Well, maybe she thought that
with all of your history, it could be...

244
00:16:36,608 --> 00:16:40,863
- ...you know, implicit.
- Well, it needs to be "plicit."

245
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:44,616
All right, let's think about this.
I mean, there's gotta be an explanation.

246
00:16:44,783 --> 00:16:48,787
- Did you do anything to make her mad?
- No, I don't think so.

247
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:52,583
You know, maybe she was just
really spent from our talk.

248
00:16:52,749 --> 00:16:54,668
- It was pretty intense.
- Yeah, mine too.

249
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:56,879
- Mine was a humdinger.
- Okay!

250
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:03,969
I mean, don't I deserve anything?
I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?

251
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:08,474
Not from you!

252
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,478
Ross, if you're this upset,
you should go and talk to her.

253
00:17:12,644 --> 00:17:15,105
And say what? You owe me a goodbye?

254
00:17:15,272 --> 00:17:18,692
- I mean, he's got more pride than that.
- The hell I do!

255
00:17:22,654 --> 00:17:25,032
- I don't get a goodbye?
- What?

256
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,495
Everyone gets a goodbye but me?
What do I gotta do to get a goodbye?

257
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:32,748
Huh? Be best friends with you?
Go out with you?

258
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:34,333
Have a baby with you?

259
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,044
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute!
I did all those things!

260
00:17:38,295 --> 00:17:40,422
- Ross...
- Or maybe I'm just not giving you...

261
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:45,260
...enough credit. Uh, I mean, it is difficult
to say goodbye to five people.

262
00:17:45,427 --> 00:17:48,305
Goodbye, goodbye,
goodbye, goodbye, g...

263
00:17:48,472 --> 00:17:50,307
It's physically impossible!

264
00:17:53,477 --> 00:17:55,896
You know what?
After all we've been through...

265
00:17:56,063 --> 00:17:59,316
...I can't believe this is how
you want to leave things between us.

266
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:01,777
Have a good time in Paris.

267
00:18:06,865 --> 00:18:10,077
- I hope Ross isn't too upset.
- I'm sure he's not more bummed out...

268
00:18:10,244 --> 00:18:12,246
- ...than I am.
- Tell me about it.

269
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:15,332
Well, you can't say we don't know
how to throw a party.

270
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,293
I think I'm gonna head out.

271
00:18:18,752 --> 00:18:23,048
- Uh, where do you think you're going?
- I thought I was going home to bed...

272
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:26,260
...but I'm sensing there's something
less fun for me to do here.

273
00:18:27,386 --> 00:18:30,180
We're moving in a couple days
and we got a lot of packing to do.

274
00:18:30,347 --> 00:18:34,476
- It'd be great if you guys could pitch in.
- Joey and I can finish up the guest room.

275
00:18:34,643 --> 00:18:36,395
Yeah, good idea.

276
00:18:37,688 --> 00:18:40,107
Oh, no. You and Phoebe
are gonna help me in here.

277
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:43,151
You couldn't be cool.

278
00:18:44,778 --> 00:18:46,446
We're gonna start in the kitchen.

279
00:18:46,613 --> 00:18:49,658
Plates get put into plate protectors
and stacked 10 to a box.

280
00:18:49,825 --> 00:18:53,787
The silverware gets bundled in rubber
bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?

281
00:18:53,954 --> 00:18:55,872
- Yeah.
- Good. I need you to be careful...

282
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,709
...and efficient. And remember,
if I'm harsh with you...

283
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,712
...it is only because
you're doing it wrong.

284
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,842
Hey, Mon, I think I figured out
whose handcuffs they are.

285
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:09,720
- You did? How?
- Well, I was cleaning out the closet...

286
00:19:09,886 --> 00:19:12,264
...and I found some pictures of them...

287
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:16,351
- ...being used.
- Oh, my God, let me see.

288
00:19:18,186 --> 00:19:19,479
Who's that dirty old lady?

289
00:19:21,064 --> 00:19:22,482
Monica's grandmother.

290
00:19:23,984 --> 00:19:27,613
Oh, my God. Nana liked it rough!

291
00:19:29,197 --> 00:19:30,907
- Hi.
- Hey.

292
00:19:31,074 --> 00:19:32,451
Here, have a seat. Yeah.

293
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:34,578
- How was your night?
- Oh, it was okay.

294
00:19:34,745 --> 00:19:37,497
I went to a movie with my cousin
then out for dinner.

295
00:19:37,664 --> 00:19:39,625
We went to this place that had...

296
00:19:45,422 --> 00:19:49,009
Anyway, they had these
really amazing cheeseburgers.

297
00:19:51,803 --> 00:19:55,057
- Erica, are you okay?
- Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much.

298
00:19:55,223 --> 00:19:59,936
I keep getting these stomachaches.
They come and go every few minutes.

299
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:06,151
- Oh, my God.
- Relax, we'll just get her some antacids.

300
00:20:06,693 --> 00:20:09,196
She doesn't have a stomachache!
She's in labor!

301
00:20:09,363 --> 00:20:11,823
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, you gotta get to the hospital!

302
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:15,952
Chandler, get the coats! Erica, let's go!
Phoebe and Joey, keep packing!

303
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:18,664
Oh, my God, we're gonna have a baby.

304
00:20:19,414 --> 00:20:21,208
We're gonna have a baby!

305
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,460
Oh, my God, we're gonna have a baby!

306
00:20:23,627 --> 00:20:26,838
Oh, God, I've gotta sit down!
I've gotta sit down!

307
00:20:28,548 --> 00:20:32,094
- Honey, it's gonna be okay.
- You can do this. Just breathe.

308
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:35,305
Okay. Okay.

309
00:20:35,472 --> 00:20:36,890
Okay, I feel a little better.

310
00:20:37,057 --> 00:20:40,018
Oh! Are you sure?

311
00:20:41,311 --> 00:20:43,897
- Yes, I'm sure. Oh, honey, let's go.
- Okay.

312
00:20:44,064 --> 00:20:45,774
- Come, let's go.
- Bye!

313
00:20:45,941 --> 00:20:47,818
- We're having a baby!
- Good luck!

314
00:20:47,984 --> 00:20:49,778
- Chandler, wait, wait, wait!
- What?

315
00:20:49,945 --> 00:20:53,448
If you get a second, find out
where she got that cheeseburger.

316
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:03,959
You think I didn't say goodbye
to you because I don't care?

317
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:05,669
That's what it seemed like.

318
00:21:05,836 --> 00:21:10,549
I cannot believe that after 10 years
you do not know one thing about me!

319
00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:16,012
- Then why didn't you say something?
- Because it is too damn hard, Ross!

320
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:20,809
I can't even begin to explain to you
how much I am gonna miss you.

321
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:25,647
When I think about not seeing you
every day, it makes me not want to go.

322
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,609
Okay? So if you think that
I didn't say goodbye to you...

323
00:21:29,776 --> 00:21:33,572
...because you don't mean as much
to me as everybody else, you're wrong.

324
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:36,491
It's because you mean more to me.

325
00:21:36,658 --> 00:21:39,119
So there, all right?
There's your goodbye!

326
00:21:39,578 --> 00:21:40,996
- Rash!
- What?

- A little more. A little more.
- All right.

330
00:22:12,652 --> 00:22:14,905
