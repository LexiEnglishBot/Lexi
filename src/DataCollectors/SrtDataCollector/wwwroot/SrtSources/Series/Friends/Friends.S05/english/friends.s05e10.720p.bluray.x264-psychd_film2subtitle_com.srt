1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,133
- What are you doing?
- I reorganized the fridge, heh.

2
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,845
See?
Uh, bottom shelf, meats and dairy.

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,432
Middle shelf, fruits and vegetables.

4
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:20,936
And top shelf, expired products.

5
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,982
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I am bored out of my mind.

6
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,028
I've already been to the bank,
post office and dry cleaners.

7
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,489
Dude, you just described
seven days worth of stuff.

8
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,618
Gotta spread it out a little, you know.
Haven't you ever been unemployed?

9
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,163
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical.

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,123
Hey, don't get religious on me, okay?

11
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,920
A guy in your position needs to be
a little better at relaxing, you know.

12
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:50,549
Why do you think we have
the comfortable chairs, huh? Here, sit down.

13
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,053
Ready? Watch.

14
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,055
Aw!

15
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,306
And then...

16
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,850
Aw, yeah! Huh?

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,478
- So, what? We just sit?
- Oh, no, no.

18
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,147
We're not gonna just sit. Watch.

19
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,775
Shh.

20
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,611
Hello. Chandler Bing.

21
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,321
Hello, Mr. Bing.

22
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,281
I love you.

23
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,077
All right, whoever this is,
stop calling me.

24
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,623
It's been six months! It's not funny!

25
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,459
But I love you.

26
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,504
Leave me alone!
For the love of God, leave me alone!

27
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,798
And that's Wednesday. Ah!

28
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,100
Hey, you guys. Guess what?

29
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,730
The British are coming?

30
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,526
Oh, you and your ways.

31
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,407
Since it's Christmas, I'm gonna be
one of those people collecting donations.

32
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,910
Yeah. I already have my bell,
and later on I get my bucket.

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,162
Oh.

34
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,123
Yeah, yeah.
I'll be spreading joy to the people.

35
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,834
Last year I spread a little joy,
but not enough.

36
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,129
So this year, I'm gonna do the whole city.
Heh.

37
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,925
I knew a girl in high school
who did that. She was very popular.

38
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:01,805
Uh, so, Pheebs, where are you
doing your bell ringing?

39
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,725
They gave me a great spot
right by Macy's.

40
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,311
They never give such a good corner
to a rookie...

41
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:10,856
...but I'm the only one who can say
"Merry Christmas" in 25 languages.

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,692
I lied.

43
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,070
Oh, my God. Okay, you guys, here's Danny.

44
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,573
Just watch this.

45
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,537
See? Still pretending he's not interested.

46
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,751
Okay, he's coming over.
Pretend we've forgotten who he is.

47
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,462
- Hey, guys.
PHOEBE, CHANDLER & MONICA: Hey, Danny.

48
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,132
Oh, Danny! Hey!

49
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,342
Oh, uh...

50
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:43,013
Danny, you know Rachel. She's nice.
She's not bad to look at, right?

51
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,183
- Thanks, Mon.
- Of course.

52
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,686
- Do you wanna go out on a date with her?
- Monica.

53
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,898
Absolutely. Is Friday okay?

54
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,524
Oh, my God.

55
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,902
Friday is perfect. She can't wait.

56
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,948
On the date, I will be able
to talk to her directly, right?

57
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,408
See you Friday.

58
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:08,330
Okay, what the hell was that?
You know what? Don't answer me.

59
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,374
I have a date with Danny. Ha!

60
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,296
How could I not get the part?

61
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:20,175
The play was about a 29-year-old
Italian actor from Queens.

62
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,387
Well, Talia Shire
suddenly became available.

63
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,722
She's a woman!

64
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,767
What can I say? She nailed it.

65
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,562
Uh, okay. Is there anything else?

66
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,649
Well, you're just gonna say no again, but...

67
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,359
...gay porn?

68
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,863
Happy holidays!

69
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,202
And Merry Christmas.

70
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,580
Oh, thank you, sir. Here's some joy.

71
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,750
- Hey.
- How's it going?

72
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:54,960
Well, it's going okay.

73
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,380
- Oh, good. Here, let me help you out.
- Oh, thanks.

74
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,756
- Yeah.
- Wow. Ha, ha.

75
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,970
Is that a new suede jacket?
It looks really expensive.

76
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,266
Yeah. I guess.

77
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,644
Just get your nails done?

78
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,064
Yes, Phoebe,
but this is all I have, okay?

79
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,275
Okay, thanks. Happy holidays.

80
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,569
- Here's your joy.
- Thank you.

81
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,322
Thank you. Happy holidays and...
Wait.

82
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:27,200
- You can't take the money out.
- I'm making change for the bus.

83
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,995
Can't you leave the dollar?
This money's for the poor.

84
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,497
I'm poor. I gotta take the bus.

85
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,584
Okay. Seasons greetings and everything.
But still...

86
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,960
Bite me, blondie!

87
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,128
Oh!

88
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:44,176
Oh, I'm gonna give him
something besides joy. Just...

89
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,391
That part was perfect for me.
I can't believe I didn't get it.

90
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,643
I'm sorry, man.

91
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,604
You know what you should do?

92
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,398
You should make something happen
for yourself.

93
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,817
You know, like write a play.

94
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:04,613
Write a movie, huh? What about
those Good Will Hunting guys?

95
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:08,700
Come on, Ross. Be realistic, you know?
If I did write something...

96
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,412
...what are the chances I could
get those guys to star in it?

97
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,835
- Wait a second. I could star in it!
- Or that.

98
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,799
I can't write, you know. I mean, I'm an actor.

99
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:27,719
I don't have the discipline
that it takes, you know. I can't do it.

100
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,596
I'll help you.

101
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:33,892
Yeah. I'll make up a schedule
and make sure you stick to it.

102
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,769
Plus it'll give me something to do.

103
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,147
- Really? You'd do that for me? Thanks.
- Yeah.

104
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,609
We'll start off slow.
The only thing you have to do tonight...

105
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,153
...is come up with the name
of your main character.

106
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,656
- Done.
- And it can't be Joey.

107
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,533
- It's not.
- Or Joseph.

108
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,201
Oh.

109
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,666
Hi. What's up?

110
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,044
I just saw Danny getting on the subway
with a girl...

111
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,921
...and he had his arm around her.

112
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,506
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

113
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,008
Well, you should be. This is all your fault.

114
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,596
You meddled in our relationship.

115
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,598
You had no relationship.

116
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,017
No, but I was doing my thing,
and everything...

117
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,603
...was going according to the plan!

118
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:22,149
Oh, God. Stop with the plan.

119
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:25,444
Unh. So what
if you saw him with a girl?

120
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,529
Who cares?
That doesn't mean anything.

121
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,616
You'll go out on a date with Danny and
be so charming he'll forget all about...

122
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,577
...that stupid subway girl.

123
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,913
She was kind of stupid.

124
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:41,293
You're right. All right.
I'm just gonna go on the date.

125
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,589
I'm just gonna go on the date.
That is the new plan.

126
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,800
Hurry, hurry!

127
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,933
Mm.

128
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:07,277
- Hey, how do you spell "suspicious"?
- Why?

129
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:11,281
Because I think this character
is gonna be suspicious about stuff.

130
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,868
Yes!

131
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:18,955
Chandler Bing, seven,
Chandler Bing, zero.

132
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,124
You're driving me crazy with that.

133
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,084
- Okay, I'll stop.
- No, don't stop.

134
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,880
Move the bowl further away.
Ross could make that shot.

135
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,805
Well, you suck. But at least
you suck at a man's game now.

136
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,975
- You wanna play?
- I can't be playing games.

137
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:43,188
Ross will be home soon. I have to write
five pages to stick to his schedule.

138
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,234
Well, so play for the next 30 minutes,
then you can write until he gets home.

139
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,528
All right.

140
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,073
But, listen,
what do you say we, uh...

141
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,991
...crank it up a notch?

142
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,326
I'm intrigued.

143
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,413
All right. All we need
is a little lighter fluid.

144
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,542
Okay, but be careful.
I wanna get our security deposit back.

145
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,003
Yeah, I think we said goodbye to that
when we invented hammer darts.

146
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,924
Do you remember which part
of the wall is not spackle?

147
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,759
Uh, yeah, right here.

148
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,640
Thank you. Happy holiday.

149
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,104
No, that's trash, young lady.
No, you can't...

150
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:28,567
Hey. Stop that young lady!
She donated trash!

151
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,570
Hey.

152
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,072
The charity's on fire!

153
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,616
Help! Good, thank you. I need that.

154
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,951
Whoo!

155
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:42,163
What is this? It's 9:00 in the morning.

156
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,251
All right. "A room.

157
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,004
A man enters. He looks suspicious."

158
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,552
That's it?

159
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,306
Joey, you were supposed to
have five pages done by now...

160
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,683
...including an exciting incident.

161
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:08,315
What is all this?
"The Official Rulebook of Fireball."

162
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,234
Yeah, that's the game we played.

163
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,487
Yeah, it's great. You take a
tennis ball, a bowl and lighter fl...

164
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,323
Oh, oh.

165
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:22,203
This is helping your career, huh?
You wanted to be an actor.

166
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,498
Not the creator of
Crazy Lawsuit Game.

167
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,293
You're right, you're right.
I'll get back to work.

168
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:32,047
And shame on you. You should know better.
Joey needs to work.

169
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,257
- Now come on.
- Hey.

170
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:38,762
No, uh-uh. You can have this back
when the five pages are done, huh?

171
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,443
- I had a really nice time tonight.
- So did I.

172
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,738
I'm really glad Monica asked us out.

173
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,625
I'd love to ask you in
but my sister's visiting.

174
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,961
- I think she's asleep on the couch.
- Your sister?

175
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,381
Your sister's asleep on the couch?

176
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:18,677
Ah, I saw you with her on the subway
and now she's asleep on the couch.

177
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,720
Oh, God!

178
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,307
- Oh, I thought I heard you.
- Oh, hey, great, you're up.

179
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,559
Rachel, my sister Krista.
Krista, Rachel.

180
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,061
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

181
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,106
Wish you told me we were having
company. I'd have fixed myself.

182
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:34,275
- Like it would help.
- You are so bad.

183
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,694
- You are.
- You are.

184
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,238
- You are. You are.
- You are. You are!

185
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,989
- You are so dead.
- Ha.

186
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,784
- I'm gonna get you. Come here.
- Aah!

187
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,787
- Come here. Come here!
- Ha-ha-ha!

188
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,502
Um, it's very nice to meet you.

189
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,884
Nobody. Nobody respects the bucket.

190
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,721
You wouldn't believe
what people put in here.

191
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,597
Look. Okay, does this look like...

192
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,016
...a garbage can to you?
- No.

193
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,436
- Does it look like an ashtray?
- No.

194
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,854
Does it look like a urinal?

195
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,856
Ew!

196
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:17,861
- So, Pheebs, you gonna go back out there?
- Yeah, but I'm not gonna take any more crap.

197
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,655
Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket.

198
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,160
Yeah, good for you. You're tough.
You lived on the street.

199
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,954
Yeah, I'm gonna go back
to being Street Phoebe.

200
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,999
Yeah. Oh, but you know what?
I can't go totally back...

201
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,252
...because Street Phoebe really
wouldn't be friends with you guys.

202
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,548
- Hey.
- Hey.

203
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,592
- Um, can I ask you guys something?
- Sure.

204
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,430
Um, I don't have any brothers so I don't
know, but did you guys wrestle?

205
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,307
- Oh, yeah.
- All the time.

206
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,226
In fact, I was undefeated.

207
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,688
Well, you weighed 200 pounds.

208
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,734
Still, I was quick as a cat.

209
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,112
Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday.

210
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,948
- Uh, that was the girl on the subway.
- Oh, you're kidding.

211
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,410
And they were very, you know...

212
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,245
...wrestle-y.

213
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,747
But I guess that's normal?

214
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,708
We don't wrestle now.

215
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,879
Not since I got
too strong for you. Ha, ha.

216
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,758
- Too strong for me?
- Yeah.

217
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,093
You wanna go right now?

218
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,514
Because I'll take you right now, buddy.
You wanna go?

219
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,933
Oh, fine.

220
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,436
Ready?

221
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,939
Wrestle!

222
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,778
Okay, you know what, um?

223
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,864
Actually, that's great. That helps a lot.
Thanks.

224
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:52,455
Guys, come on, let's go.
The puck drops in 20 minutes. Come on.

225
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:57,001
- Joey's not going.
- I didn't finish my five pages.

226
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,671
Why can't you finish them tomorrow?

227
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,465
Because tomorrow
he's redoing yesterday's pages.

228
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:06,094
Yesterday's pages
did not reflect my best work.

229
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,723
Why don't you cut him a little slack?
Maybe if he relaxes, he'll get some work done.

230
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,601
I think he's been relaxing enough,
thanks to you...

231
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,895
...and Fireball.

232
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,775
If you think Fireball's relaxing,
you obviously have never played.

233
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,612
The only reason you're doing
this to Joey is you're bored.

234
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,865
It's not his fault that you're unemployed.

235
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,659
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical.

236
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,370
Look, look. Guys, don't fight.

237
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:36,040
And the reason I'm doing this
is because I am Joey's friend.

238
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,210
And if you were a good friend,
you'd be doing the same thing.

239
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,671
So being a good friend
means acting like a jerk?

240
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,424
If it does, then you're
an amazing friend of mine.

241
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:48,094
Hey, guys. How about we settle this
over a friendly game of Fireball, huh?

242
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:52,348
- I'll go unhook the smoke detectors.
- How about we settle this right now?

243
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,228
There. Now no one's going
to the game. Ha-ha-ha.

244
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,480
- I paid for those tickets.
- No, you didn't.

245
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,483
- You said you would, but you never did.
- Oh, yeah.

246
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,452
So we finally get
to the top of the mountain, ahem...

247
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,496
...and airhead here forgets the camera.

248
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,666
You know, that same thing
happened to me one time.

249
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,670
When did that happen to you?

250
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,507
Don't you remember? We were jogging
in the park, we saw that pretty bird.

251
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,427
And I wanted to take a picture
but I didn't have my camera.

252
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:33,056
Okay. First of all, chasing the churro guy
is not jogging.

253
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:38,019
Oh, this is so good.
You have got to try it.

254
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:42,440
Hmm. Mm.

255
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,735
That is good.

256
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,116
- Oh, damn. I got it on my pants.
- Here, I'll get it.

257
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,326
Mm.

258
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,586
We better take these off
or that stain will set.

259
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:07,006
- I wanna wear these pants on our date tonight.
- Oh, great.

260
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,677
Okay, bye. Oh, my God.

261
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,555
- That was unbelievable.
- Okay, see? I told you.

262
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:18,101
- Yeah, wow. Sorry, Rach.
- I don't believe they're brother and sister.

263
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,644
They're brother and sister?

264
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,324
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

265
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,244
Wait a minute. Open your hand.
Let me take a look.

266
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,373
Quarter, dime. Lint?
Not interested in that.

267
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,043
What's this? A Canadian coin?
Get out of here!

268
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,089
Gosh.

269
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,550
Whoa. No drinks near the bucket.

270
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,553
Set it down over there
and then you can make a contribution.

271
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:58,224
And you can leave the "hurt bunny"
look over there too.

272
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:03,104
Hi, Bob.
I thought I told you to get out of here!

273
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,733
Uh, Phoebe, we've been
getting complaints.

274
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,194
And we're gonna move you
to a less high-profile spot.

275
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,446
What?

276
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:15,950
- Uh, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
- That chick can't handle my corner.

277
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,620
Look, either you leave
or we remove you.

278
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,789
Fine.

279
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,798
All right, I'll give you one pointer.
Look out for that bitch.

280
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:46,022
- Oh, hey, Rach. I thought we said 7.
- Yeah, uh, you know what? Uh, let's skip it.

281
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,857
What? Uh, why?

282
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,317
Um... Look.

283
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,570
You and your sister seem to have, um,
a very special bond...

284
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,324
Oh, great. That "special bond" again.

285
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:01,662
Why do women have such a problem
with the fact that I'm close with my sister?

286
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,917
- Okay, look, I don't know, but...
- Do you have brothers?

287
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:11,297
No, I have two sisters, but one of them
actually has a very masculine energy.

288
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:15,176
- Are you close with them?
- No, no. They're not very nice people.

289
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,887
Okay, come here. Listen.

290
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,890
I really like you, okay?
I think this could go somewhere.

291
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,602
So what if I'm close to my family?
You gonna let that stand in the way of us?

292
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,939
Well, I... I don't know...

293
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,149
See, when you put it that way, you know...

294
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,820
Danny, hurry up. The bath's getting cold.

295
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,408
- What?
- Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.

296
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,999
Oh, hey. There's some kids
playing in the street.

297
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,503
You wanna go down there,
give them a project, ruin their day?

298
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,465
Hey, if they have a ball,
maybe you could stick razor blades in it...

299
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,718
...and teach them a new game:
"Gonna-Need-Stitches Ball."

300
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,475
Hey, guys. I was at the library all morning
and I already finished my five pages for today.

301
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:08,020
Great. Now we can go
to the Ranger game last night.

302
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,650
No, dude. Ross tore up the tickets.

303
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:21,909
I guess when you don't have so many
distractions, it's easier for you to focus, huh?

304
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:26,497
Yeah, or also when you don't have somebody
breathing down your neck all the livelong day!

305
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:33,045
Well, that's fine, but the important thing
is I finished it. And I think it's really good.

306
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:37,300
But you know what would help me, is if
I could hear it. Would you guys read it for me?

307
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,845
- Yeah, all right.
- All right.

308
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,850
Okay.
"It's a typical New York City apartment.

309
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,936
Two guys are hanging out." Ross?

310
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,818
- "Hey, man."
- "What is up?"

311
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:01,240
"About yesterday.
I was really wrong. I am sorry."

312
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,952
"No, it was me. I'm sorry.
I overreacted."

313
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,832
"Maybe it was both of us.
But we had our best friend's inter...

314
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:16,839
But we had our best friend's
interest at heart."

315
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,009
"Could I be more sorry?"

316
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:28,476
"I don't know. I am one sorry...

317
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,479
...polontologist."

318
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,610
All right, Joey, we get it.

319
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,862
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

320
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,866
Oh, no, no, no. Keep reading.
The good part's coming up. Keep going.

321
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:48,246
"I am sorry, Chandler."

322
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,915
"I am sorry, Ross."

323
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,461
Ahem. "A handsome man enters."

324
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,257
"Hey. How's it going, guys?

325
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:03,719
I don't know what you two are talking about,
but I'd just like to say thanks to both of you.

326
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,555
You. You wouldn't let me
give up on myself.

327
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:10,268
And you. Well, you co-created Fireball.

328
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,896
The End." Yeah.

329
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,358
This took you all day?

330
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,403
No, no, this only took five minutes.

331
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:26,117
I spent the rest of the day coming up
with New Ultimate Fireball. Ha, ha!

332
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,499
Okay. "It's a typical New York apartment.

333
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,128
Two girls are just hanging out." Go.

334
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:41,465
- "Hi, how are you doing, Kelly?"
- "I'm doing just fine.

335
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,385
God, Tiffany, you smell so great."

336
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,097
"It's my new perfume.

337
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:52,643
Why don't you come closer
where you can really appreciate it?"

338
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,149
- Oh, you know, Joey, you are sick.
- This is disgusting.

339
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,109
I'm not reading this.

340
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:04,488
What? Wait, wait, wait.
The handsome man was about to enter!
