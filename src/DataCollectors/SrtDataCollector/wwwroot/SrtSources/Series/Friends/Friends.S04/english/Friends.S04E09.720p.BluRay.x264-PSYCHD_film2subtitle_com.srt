1
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:07,256
- Okay.
- Come on, no peeking.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:11,343
Our eyes are closed, and we're about
to cross the street. Very good.

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,303
Okay. Open up.

4
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:22,604
What do you want to show us?
Because all I can see is this bitchen van.

5
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,774
Yeah, it's for our catering business.

6
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,985
- Oh.
- I think I know that girl.

7
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,699
- We're not gonna keep it this way, though.
- No?

8
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,910
We're gonna paint over the sword
and replace it with a baguette.

9
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,746
Oh.

10
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:42,166
Um, also, we don't know what to do
with this.

11
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,212
Oh, yeah, I definitely know her.

12
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,308
Remember that guy from cooking school
that put cilantro in everything?

13
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,310
- Oh, sure, Cilantro Larry.
- Yeah.

14
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:47,606
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic
for the Chelsea Reporter.

15
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:52,611
Wow. Monica, what an amazing opportunity
to influence...

16
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,321
...dozens of people.

17
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,159
What about our catering business?

18
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,161
Oh, no, no, it's just one night a week.

19
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,956
Plus, I get to take all of you out
for free dinners.

20
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,290
- Hey.
- Oh.

21
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,542
Well, in that case:

22
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,006
- That was me hopping on board.
- Oh.

23
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:18,011
Hey, guys. Hey, Ross.
Quick question for you.

24
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,680
Are you ready to party?

25
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,559
I don't know, I could maybe go out
for a couple of beers.

26
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:27,855
But there's this thing about bumblebees
on the Discovery Channel.

27
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,235
No, no, no, I don't think you heard me.
Are you ready to party?

28
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,530
No.

29
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,866
Gandalf? Gandalf is coming to town?

30
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,160
Kathy's with her parents,
I have nothing to do.

31
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,704
Tomorrow we are partying
with Gandalf, dude.

32
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:48,625
Dude, we are so gonna party. Yeah.

33
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,669
Wow, okay. Dude alert.

34
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,173
And who is this guy?

35
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,594
Mike "Gandalf" Ganderson.
Only, like, the funnest guy in the world.

36
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,387
I'm gonna call
and get off work tomorrow.

37
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,724
Oh. I'm gonna call after you.

38
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,852
This is gonna be so cool.
Dude, we never party anymore.

39
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,271
Whoo!

40
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:13,275
All right, were you guys
smoking something in the back of our van?

41
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,613
What do you mean, we never have fun?
You have fun with me.

42
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,909
Remember the time we saw those strippers
and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?

43
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:28,207
Joey, you are gonna love this guy.
Gandalf is like the party wizard.

44
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:32,002
- Well, why do you call him Gandalf?
- Gandalf the wizard.

45
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,715
Hello? Didn't you read
Lord of the Rings in high school?

46
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,760
No, I had sex in high school.

47
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:50,520
Oh. Uh, Joanna? I was wondering
if I could ask you something.

48
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,398
There's an opening for an assistant buyer
in Junior Miss...

49
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,609
Okay, but that would be a step down
for me.

50
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,237
No, actually, I meant for me.

51
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,948
The hiring committee
is meeting people all day and...

52
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:06,119
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but I guess
you can't stay my assistant forever.

53
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:09,206
Neither can you, Sophie,
but for different reasons.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,126
I'm so glad
you don't have a problem with this.

55
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,629
If you did,
I wouldn't have considered applying.

56
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,838
Really? In that case...

57
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,216
And that's why I'm so glad
there's no problem.

58
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:23,845
Yeah, it's fine. I'm on the hiring committee,
so there'll be one friendly face.

59
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,430
Oh, that's great.

60
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,183
- You know, Junior Miss is where I started.
- Really?

61
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,603
I had to sleep with the ugliest guy
to get that job.

62
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,233
- Really?
- No. Ha, ha.

63
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,985
Yeah.

64
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,697
- I mean, no. No, no, no. Ha, ha.
- No. Ha, ha.

65
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:45,200
I'm sure with your qualifications,
you won't need to sleep with some guy.

66
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,410
Oh. Ha, ha.

67
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,704
Although, uh,
I might need some convincing.

68
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,916
- Um... Oh.
- Kidding. Ha, ha.

69
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,254
- God, I feel wild today.
- Aah!

70
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,679
Oh, man, I am so excited, I may vomit.

71
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,600
Will you calm down?
He's just a human guy.

72
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,562
Look, you don't understand.
Gandalf is amazing.

73
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,355
You never know what's gonna happen.

74
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:19,985
You go out for a couple of beers and
end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia.

75
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,779
- Really?
- Oh, yeah, it's beautiful country up there.

76
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,198
Hey. Okay.

77
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:30,203
I got my passport, fresh socks,
and a snakebite kit.

78
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,040
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.

79
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,043
All right, I'll see you guys.

80
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,837
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

81
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,882
I have an audition,
but I'll hook up with you later.

82
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,884
- Where you gonna be around noon?
- Heh.

83
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,178
Somewhere maybe along the equator?

84
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,848
Okay.

85
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,643
Hello?

86
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:54,978
It's Gandalf.

87
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,775
So are you in town?

88
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,445
Oh, well...

89
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,073
Well, maybe next time, then.

90
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,033
What happened?

91
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,285
He's not gonna make it.
He's stuck in Chicago.

92
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,787
Oh, man.

93
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,623
Chicago's so lucky.

94
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,294
Stupid, useless Canadian money.

95
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,803
You have a very impressive résumé,
Ms. Green.

96
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,307
I especially like what I see here
about implementing a new filing system.

97
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,975
Thank you.

98
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:38,105
Filing system? Oh, you mean those little
colored labels you put on all the folders?

99
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:41,650
It certainly did brighten up
the inside of the filing cabinets.

100
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:46,279
Well, they, uh... They did more than that.

101
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:50,492
I notice that you've been entrusted
with a lot of important responsibilities.

102
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,163
Yes. Joanna really has been
an incredible mentor to me.

103
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:59,126
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible
at getting my morning bagel.

104
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,920
It's amazing how she gets it right
almost every time.

105
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,383
Of course,
I have more responsibilities than that.

106
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:12,139
Oh, yes, of course. There's the coffee too.
Rachel can carry two things at once.

107
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,642
That's, uh, very good.

108
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,854
Now, a big part of this job...

109
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,941
...is cultivating personal relationships,
especially with designers.

110
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,652
- Yes, I realize...
- Rachel shouldn't have any problem.

111
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,531
Her only problem might be getting a little
too friendly, if you know what I mean.

112
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,409
I love working with designers.

113
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,704
With them, under them,
what's the difference, eh, Rach?

114
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,628
Hey. My first review is out.

115
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,548
Oh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter.

116
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,010
Ah. These used to keep me so warm.

117
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,054
- All right, look, I'm on the back page.
- Ooh. Oh!

118
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:57,434
Okay. "Would I go back to Allesandro's?
Sure, but I would have to order two meals.

119
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:01,188
One for me, and one for the guy
pointing the gun to my head."

120
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,316
Wow, you really laid into this place.

121
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,652
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word
to make friends.

122
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,323
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy
who could fix up the van for catering.

123
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,700
- Oh. You want me to go with you?
- No, no, it's okay.

124
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,578
But are we sure
we don't want the waterbed?

125
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,290
- Haven't we made this decision?
- Yeah, all right.

126
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,543
- Bye.
- Bye.

127
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:30,884
Who is it?

128
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,845
It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.

129
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,515
Oh, my God.

130
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,935
- I wanna talk to you about your review.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

131
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,312
Call me on the phone.

132
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,357
What, so you can hang up on me?

133
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,276
I'm never gonna let you up,
so you may as well just go away.

134
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,653
Just give me a chance to...

135
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,113
Do you need to get in? Here you go.

136
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,324
- No, Phoebe!
- Oh, hey, Monica.

137
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,543
I want a retraction.
Our food is not "inedible swill."

138
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,752
I couldn't eat it.

139
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,422
I have five friends who couldn't eat it,
and one of them eats books.

140
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,009
Well, our service is not
"grossly incompetent."

141
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:16,304
The waiter carried the breadsticks
in his pants.

142
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:21,351
Well, you said that we accept
the Discover Card...

143
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,937
...which we do not.

144
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,815
All right, that I'll retract.

145
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,193
But I stand by my review.
I know food, and that wasn't it.

146
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,737
Your marinara sauce
tastes like tomato juice.

147
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,865
You should serve it with vodka
and a piece of celery.

148
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,368
Hey, I'm proud of that sauce.
It's delicious.

149
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,953
Oh, my God.

150
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,914
You own an Italian restaurant
and you think that tastes good?

151
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,207
Where are you even from?

152
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,752
Lebanon.

153
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,171
Hand me those tomatoes.

154
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,842
I'm gonna show you what it should
taste like. Come on, hand them to me.

155
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,513
How long is this gonna take?
I got another critic I gotta go yell at.

156
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,814
Ahem. Uh, Joanna,
I wanna talk about that interview.

157
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,233
I thought it went very well.

158
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:15,864
No, it didn't.
That's what I wanna talk to you about.

159
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,992
Now, just to brief you...

160
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,704
...I may cry.

161
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:27,626
But they are not tears of sadness
or of anger...

162
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,253
...but just of me having this discussion
with you.

163
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,131
Rachel, please, don't make a scene.

164
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,925
There's nobody here.

165
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,927
Sophie, get in here.

166
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,891
You see?
Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable.

167
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,768
She's not making me uncomfortable.

168
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:49,022
Congratulations, you've just crossed
the line into completely useless. Get out.

169
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,401
Do you want me to quit?

170
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,654
What? What would make you think that?

171
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,157
Well, all of those things you said
in the interview.

172
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,452
If you believe any of them,
I must not be a very good assistant.

173
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,664
You know what?

174
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,584
I am just going to pack up my desk...

175
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:14,506
...and I will be gone
by the end of the day.

176
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:21,680
Well, I guess there's no use me
sticking around till the end of the day.

177
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,807
Wait, wait, wait.

178
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,768
You can put your sad little muffin
back in its drawer.

179
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:32,148
If you must know the truth,
I didn't wanna lose a good assistant.

180
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,525
What?

181
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:38,363
That's why I said all those things
about your flirting and your drinking.

182
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,198
My drinking?

183
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,244
Oh. I must have said that after you left.

184
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,955
Said what, exactly?

185
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,915
That you enjoy the occasional drink...

186
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,917
...- ing binge.

187
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,796
Oh, my God. Oh. That is it. I'm leaving.

188
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:58,299
- You are just a horrible person.
- No, wait, wait, wait.

189
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,386
Now, if you're gonna get
all sensitive about it.

190
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,929
I don't want to lose you.

191
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,640
What if I create a position for you?

192
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,810
I'll make you assistant buyer
in this department.

193
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,731
- Say more things like that.
- Um...

194
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,526
You can have your own office and a raise,
effective tomorrow.

195
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,904
- I'd need an expense account.
- Done.

196
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,991
- And an assistant.
- Sophie, get in here.

197
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:29,247
Now it seems like a lifetime, doesn't it?
Starting from...

198
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,999
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

199
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,836
I thought you'd be partying
with Gandoldorf.

200
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,673
It's Gandalf, and he's not coming.

201
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,177
- So you've been sitting here all morning?
- No.

202
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,846
I balanced my checkbook.

203
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,725
Yeah, and I gave first names
to all the foosball players.

204
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,021
I can't believe he didn't come.

205
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,483
So what if he didn't come?
We can still go out and party ourselves.

206
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,320
Oh, no, you know, with Gandalf,
we'd be out all night.

207
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:04,741
Yeah, we'd meet total strangers
and hang out with them.

208
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,367
Well, we could do that.

209
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,288
There was other stuff too.

210
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,749
We'll do it all, and better.

211
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,710
Look, after tonight,
Gandalf will wanna party with us, dude.

212
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,920
Come on.

213
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,881
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

214
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,468
- It's not like we don't know how to party.
- Yeah. All right. Let's go.

215
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,595
And maybe we could end up
on a boat again?

216
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,222
- Yeah!
- All right!

217
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,598
Ah!

218
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:32,143
Hey, hey, hey. When were we on a boat?

219
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,103
Remember that really cold morning...

220
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,940
...when you woke up
and those dogs were licking your face?

221
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,775
- Yeah.
- Those were seals, man.

222
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,661
Hey, how do you think this suit would look
on an assistant buyer...?

223
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,955
The owner of Allesandro's
came to yell at me...

224
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:55,333
...but I made him some sauce,
and he offered me the job as head chef.

225
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,543
Oh, my God.

226
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,922
You just ruined the thing I was practicing
the whole way home, but I'm so happy.

227
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,384
Can you believe it?
I finally get to run my own kitchen.

228
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,593
Oh, you've waited so long.

229
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,804
- Ha, ha, oh.
- Oh.

230
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,431
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs. Quick question for you.

231
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:14,978
How do you think this suit would look
on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?

232
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,940
I don't know. It would totally depend
on her coloring and...

233
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,984
- You got the job!
- Yes!

234
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:24,028
Oh! You got the job?
Why didn't you tell me?

235
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:30,326
Oh. It's gonna be so great.
I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell.

236
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:33,162
I'm gonna have an office
with walls and everything.

237
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,291
- I'm gonna have walls.
- Aw.

238
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,794
Is this the day of good news or what?
I got us a job.

239
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,045
The wedding reception.

240
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,672
Oh.

241
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:47,135
Um, Phoebe,
I kind of need to talk to you about that.

242
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,805
Um...

243
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,727
Well, I think it might be time for me
to take a step back from the catering.

244
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,646
- But we've only had one job.
- Tsk.

245
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:03,568
I know, but now we have this second one,
and it just feels like it's snowballing.

246
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,195
Yeah, what are you saying?

247
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,699
I got offered the head-chef job
at Allesandro's.

248
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:14,370
- What?
- It's okay, you don't really need me.

249
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,915
You're the cook.

250
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,376
Without you,
it's just me driving up to people's houses...

251
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,545
...with empty trays and asking for money.

252
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,508
All right.

253
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:31,095
But, um, well, I'll pay you back
all the money you invested.

254
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,390
- And you can keep the van.
- For what?

255
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,437
I can't believe this.
I gotta get out of here.

256
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,731
Phoebe, wait a minute.

257
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,362
I'm an assistant buyer!

258
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:55,411
All right, we'll get a little coffee,
get energized, then we'll head back out.

259
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,872
- Yeah, all right.
- Okay.

260
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:05,046
So we're having fun, right?
We don't need that wizard guy.

261
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,216
We hit a couple of clubs,
talked to some strangers...

262
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,928
...then after this, we'll go down
to the docks and see about that boat thing.

263
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,182
I'm kind of beat.

264
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,226
Actually...

265
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,894
...me too.

266
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,062
Are you serious?

267
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,271
Yeah.

268
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,190
Thank God. I'm exhausted.

269
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,944
So you guys want coffees?

270
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,280
Yeah, but I don't wanna be up too late,
so I'll have a decaf.

271
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,241
Yeah, me too.

272
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,828
Actually, could I get some hot water
with a little lemon?

273
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:42,667
I strained my voice screaming in there.
Does it have to be so loud?

274
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,920
Oh. I can't hear a word you're saying,
my ears are ringing so bad.

275
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,674
Huh. I was glad I brought that extra pair
of socks, you know?

276
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,925
I used them as mittens.

277
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,011
I didn't wanna touch a thing
in that last place.

278
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,429
Oh.

279
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,768
How sad are we?

280
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,270
Yeah, I know.

281
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,231
You know what? We're not sad.

282
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,734
We're not sad,
we're just not 21 anymore, you know?

283
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,402
I'm 29 years old, damn it.

284
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,113
I wanna sit in a comfortable chair,
watch television...

285
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,115
...and go to sleep at a reasonable hour.

286
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,450
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

287
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:19,287
Yeah, and I like to hang out in a quiet place
where I can talk to my friends.

288
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,496
Yeah.

289
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:25,501
And so what if I like to go home,
throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath?

290
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,798
We're 29. We're not women.

291
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,684
Oh. There you are.

292
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,937
Hey, I'm glad that you decided
to hear me out.

293
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,190
Okay, I'm hearing.

294
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,026
I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot.

295
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:55,198
And, well, I came up with a whole bunch of
businesses that you can do with your van.

296
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,866
Okay, um...

297
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,620
- You could be a flower delivery person.
- What?

298
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,914
Or a bakery delivery person.

299
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,333
Pizza?

300
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,919
Monica.

301
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,838
All right, I got a whole bunch of stuff
in this area...

302
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,716
...but I'm getting the feeling
you don't wanna deliver.

303
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,929
- No.
- Okay.

304
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,350
I'm guessing if you don't wanna deliver...

305
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,603
...you probably don't wanna
pick up stuff either.

306
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,313
No.

307
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,819
You know what?

308
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,364
- Let's do the catering business.
- Really? Are you sure?

309
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:40,326
Yeah. You know,
I made a commitment to you.

310
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,538
- Know what? It'd be fun.
- Oh, it will be fun.

311
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,706
- Oh. Yay!
- Aw.

312
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,918
Okay. Ooh, let's plan
the wedding reception. Okay.

313
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,173
Wow.

314
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,427
You really wanted me
to do something with this van.

315
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,018
You know what?
I want you to take the chefjob.

316
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,021
- Really?
- Yeah.

317
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,315
That's what you really want.

318
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,734
Yeah, I don't wanna be the reason
you're unhappy.

319
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,194
That would make me unhappy.

320
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:18,406
And I really don't wanna be the reason
I'm unhappy.

321
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,159
Thank you.

322
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:27,081
Besides, it might be kind of fun
to form the new A-Team.

323
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,093
Oh, hi, Mrs. Lynch. Is Joanna in already?

324
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,971
Oh, my goodness. You haven't heard.

325
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,639
Heard what?

326
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,976
Joanna passed away last night.

327
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,812
Oh, my God. How?

328
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,899
Well, she was leaving work,
and she was hit by a cab.

329
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,943
Oh, my God. Oh, I cannot believe it.

330
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:59,363
- I know.
- Oh, God.

331
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:04,619
Oh, God.

332
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,997
I didn't realize that you were so close.

333
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,751
Yes. So close.

334
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:19,508
Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional
and difficult time for all of us.

335
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:23,512
But by any chance, did Joanna
send any paperwork your way...

336
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,641
...before it happened?

337
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:29,143
No, nothing.

338
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,940
Imagine, if she'd just stepped off that curb
a few seconds later...

339
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:39,070
Oh. Yes, yes, just a few seconds
and she'd still be with us.

340
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,656
Nothing about an assistant buyer?

341
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,533
I'm sorry. I have to go.

342
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:47,995
Good morning.

343
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,123
Oh, Sophie,
I guess you didn't hear about Joanna.

344
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,792
I sure did.

345
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,842
I'm so excited about having Monica
come on board with us.

346
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,846
Although I do feel bad
about having fired Chef Emilio.

347
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,766
It is like losing a member of the family.

348
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:13,104
Of course, that literally is the case
for several of you.

349
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,358
Tony, Carlos, Marie...

350
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:21,570
...please tell your father
how much we're going to miss him.

351
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:27,410
Now, I know that Monica
has a lot of great ideas for this place.

352
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,496
Well, you all read the review. Ha, ha.

353
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,999
So without much further ado...

354
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:37,295
...I present to you our new head chef.

355
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:48,222
Um, I just wanna say, uh,
that with a pinch of excitement...

356
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,726
...a dash of hard work,
and a dollop of cooperation...

357
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,853
...we can have the recipe...

358
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,567
Are you going to kill me?
