1
00:00:01,252 --> 00:00:02,806
Bye-bye.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,346
I just got us reservations
at Michelle's...

3
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:07,677
...and tickets to The Music Man
to celebrate...

4
00:00:07,897 --> 00:00:10,495
...our first holiday season
as a betrothed couple.

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,668
- "Betrothed."
- Betrothed couple.

6
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,035
- Hey!
- Hi!

7
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:23,857
Pheebs?

8
00:00:24,145 --> 00:00:25,603
Skull?

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,130
Yeah, it's my mom's.

10
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:28,840
Oh, my God!

11
00:00:29,538 --> 00:00:31,590
No, no, no. It's not my mom.

12
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:34,301
It belonged to my mom.

13
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,151
She used to put it out
every Christmas...

14
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:41,635
...to remind us that even though
it's Christmas, people still die.

15
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:45,218
And you can put candy in it.

16
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,473
- Hey.
- Hey.

17
00:00:49,787 --> 00:00:50,759
Licorice?

18
00:00:52,257 --> 00:00:53,467
Sure.

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,431
- I get Ben for the holidays this year.
- That's great!

20
00:00:57,684 --> 00:01:00,222
- Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
- Nope.

21
00:01:00,503 --> 00:01:02,235
I mean,
I know Susan does every year...

22
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:05,367
...but I want to take this year
to teach him about Hanukkah.

23
00:01:05,616 --> 00:01:06,897
And maybe I could teach Ben...

24
00:01:07,148 --> 00:01:09,995
...about the Christmas skull
and how people die.

25
00:01:10,627 --> 00:01:14,209
You may need to use this year
to teach Ben about Phoebe.

26
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,456
Hey.

27
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:27,457
- Did you know he was in there?
- No.

28
00:01:28,997 --> 00:01:31,702
- How long have we been home?
- About half an hour.

29
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:33,198
Lovely.

30
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:39,180
The One With The Holiday Armadillo

31
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:15,441
You know what I was thinking?
When we get married, are you gonna...

32
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:17,217
...change your last name to "Bing"?

33
00:02:18,402 --> 00:02:19,576
No.

34
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:22,712
Why not?

35
00:02:23,655 --> 00:02:24,935
"Bing" is weird.

36
00:02:26,473 --> 00:02:29,178
Yeah, I know what you mean. Gellar!

37
00:02:31,448 --> 00:02:33,322
Oh, hey, you guys.

38
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:38,224
Guess what. My landlord just called.
My apartment's gonna be ready soon.

39
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:39,936
So I guess I'll be moving out.

40
00:02:40,215 --> 00:02:41,804
Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you.

41
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,898
Yes, you will be very sad.

42
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:49,606
- I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
- You guys are gonna live together again?

43
00:02:49,923 --> 00:02:52,592
- Yeah, why not?
- She's just having so much fun with Joey...

44
00:02:52,845 --> 00:02:55,134
...I just assumed she'd still
be living with him.

45
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,947
Why do you think she's having
so much fun living with Joey?

46
00:02:58,168 --> 00:03:00,422
No reason, except she...

47
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:02,404
...told me.

48
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,292
Really? She said she didn't want
to live with me?

49
00:03:05,613 --> 00:03:08,246
No. No, she didn't say that.

50
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:11,099
I think you should talk to Monica now.

51
00:03:12,711 --> 00:03:15,284
Phoebe, don't worry. I'm sure
she wants to live with you.

52
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,083
You're sure?
You're absolutely sure?

53
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:19,699
No, but I'll bet she probably does.

54
00:03:19,947 --> 00:03:20,979
Oh, probably?

55
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:22,584
I don't like that word.

56
00:03:24,018 --> 00:03:27,423
I know what "probably" really means.
Yeah, yeah.

57
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:30,553
"Oh, your mom
probably won't kill herself."

58
00:03:31,603 --> 00:03:35,565
You know, "No, the funeral director
probably won't hit on you."

59
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:40,333
"Yeah, that nice couple probably
will adopt you. " Okay, I'm sorry.

60
00:03:40,648 --> 00:03:42,700
I'm sorry,
but I'm not hanging all my hopes...

61
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,899
...of Rachel and I living together
on "probably."

62
00:03:46,215 --> 00:03:48,753
You gotta take care of yourself
in this world.

63
00:03:48,998 --> 00:03:51,252
History teaches us nothing.

64
00:03:53,974 --> 00:03:56,572
"Bing" doesn't seem so weird now,
does it?

65
00:04:02,428 --> 00:04:03,400
Great, you're home.

66
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:05,900
Guess what Phoebe got me
for Christmas.

67
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:17,142
- Drums?
- No, drums!

68
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,737
Hi, could we get
two burritos to go, please?

69
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:31,714
I'm sorry. But not that sorry,
because you don't have to live with it.

70
00:04:31,932 --> 00:04:34,293
We have a reservation under
the name Chandler Bing.

71
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:38,184
Okay, we'll have a table for you
in about 45 minutes.

72
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,357
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets
to The Music Man at 8.

73
00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:44,344
I'm sorry.
Christmas is a very busy time, sir.

74
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:46,787
Is this because of the burrito thing?

75
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:52,657
- You need to give him money.
- Give him money? It was a joke!

76
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:56,523
No. To get a table. Places like this
are always shaking you down.

77
00:04:56,808 --> 00:05:00,106
- Everybody wants a payoff.
- All right, calm down, O'Malley.

78
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,461
- I'll slip him some money.
- But you've got to be smooth about it.

79
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:07,766
Hey, I can be smooth.

80
00:05:12,151 --> 00:05:15,141
We're in a bit of a hurry,
so if you could get us a table...

81
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:17,011
...a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.

82
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,104
- Of course, sir.
- Okay.

83
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:24,320
- How'd it go?
- Had the money in the wrong hand.

84
00:05:31,043 --> 00:05:32,051
Hey. You don't feel...

85
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,239
...like you're gonna throw up, do you?
- No.

86
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:36,396
Well, I do. So let's...

87
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,056
So, Ben, you...

88
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,701
You know what holiday is coming up,
don't you?

89
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:44,853
Christmas.

90
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:48,253
Yeah, and you know what
other holiday is coming up?

91
00:05:48,543 --> 00:05:49,788
Christmas Eve.

92
00:05:51,187 --> 00:05:53,725
Yes, but also...

93
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:56,751
Hanukkah!

94
00:05:58,528 --> 00:06:01,718
See, you're part Jewish,
and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.

95
00:06:01,973 --> 00:06:04,642
Santa has reindeers that can fly.

96
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,317
Right, but on Hanukkah...

97
00:06:06,635 --> 00:06:08,711
Hanukkah is a celebration
of a miracle.

98
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:12,784
See, years and years ago, there were
these people called the Maccabees.

99
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:16,366
Okay, that's right. Yes...

100
00:06:16,654 --> 00:06:18,837
...but on Hanukkah, we sing:

101
00:06:25,388 --> 00:06:27,749
Okay, it's not a contest.

102
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,839
When is Santa coming?

103
00:06:31,128 --> 00:06:34,603
How about this year,
instead of Santa...

104
00:06:34,886 --> 00:06:37,519
...we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?

105
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,511
No Santa?

106
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:41,311
Was I bad?

107
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,630
No. Oh, no, no. Hey, you weren't bad.
You've been very good, Ben.

108
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:49,141
- Santa's mad at me.
- No, hey, hey, come on.

109
00:06:49,463 --> 00:06:51,788
Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay?

110
00:06:52,073 --> 00:06:54,089
You're his favorite little guy.

111
00:06:54,335 --> 00:06:55,758
So Santa's coming?

112
00:06:58,161 --> 00:06:59,620
Yes!

113
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,499
Santa's coming.

114
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,168
Will he bring me an ant farm?

115
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:05,246
Will you keep it at Mommy's?

116
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:07,520
- Okay.
- Then sure!

117
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:14,433
Maybe this slipping-him-money thing
is not gonna work.

118
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,739
Maybe we should just wait.

119
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:20,624
You're the one who said you would die
if you didn't see Music Man.

120
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:23,309
I didn't say "die."

121
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,861
I said "cry."

122
00:07:27,873 --> 00:07:30,162
It's easy. Just keep it casual.

123
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:33,782
Give him a kind word,
shake his hand and give him the money.

124
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:36,915
- How do you know so much about this?
- I don't know.

125
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,006
Richard used to do it, didn't he?

126
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:42,967
We'd be eating our soup right now.

127
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:46,270
Mustached bastard.

128
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:51,249
Okay, those people just left. Come on.
Quick, give him the money.

129
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:53,094
Excuse me.

130
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:02,696
We're in a bit of a hurry.
Can we...?

131
00:08:21,557 --> 00:08:23,502
So you like the drums.

132
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,622
That's great.

133
00:08:27,263 --> 00:08:29,765
You know, I was worried that
they would create maybe...

134
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,994
...an unbearable living situation.

135
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:36,237
But, okay, well, apparently not.
So, yay!

136
00:08:36,795 --> 00:08:38,527
Hey, Pheebs,
we already learned a song.

137
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:42,185
Ready? One, two, three, four.

138
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,941
Tequila!

139
00:08:48,242 --> 00:08:49,345
That's fun.

140
00:08:56,314 --> 00:08:57,250
Here you go.

141
00:08:57,636 --> 00:08:59,545
Thank you, Gunther.
Put her there.

142
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:05,149
Definitely not easier with coins.

143
00:09:06,473 --> 00:09:07,825
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

144
00:09:10,578 --> 00:09:11,752
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

145
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,959
Here. Now I only owe you 49.50.

146
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:17,981
Hey, Pheebs...

147
00:09:18,198 --> 00:09:21,982
...if you want to get Joey a Christmas
present that disrupts the entire building...

148
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:24,250
...why not get him
something more subtle...

149
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:25,633
...like a wrecking ball...

150
00:09:25,887 --> 00:09:29,470
...or a vial of smallpox
to release in the hallway?

151
00:09:29,784 --> 00:09:32,595
It's not just the drum noise.
Every five minutes...

152
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:34,507
...Joey throws his sticks
in the air...

153
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:38,199
...and I have to hear:
"Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye!"

154
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:41,054
- I mean, it is so annoying.
- Yes, thank you.

155
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:45,818
You see, this is how normal people
are supposed to react to drums.

156
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:49,750
Phoebe, you got Joey drums
to annoy Rachel...

157
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:52,536
...so she wouldn't want
to live there anymore?

158
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:54,683
Maybe on some level.

159
00:10:03,288 --> 00:10:06,443
Joey, you know that you could just
not throw the sticks up in the air.

160
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:08,607
What is rock 'n' roll about that?

161
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,754
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.

162
00:10:15,152 --> 00:10:17,512
Hold it!
Before you tell me what it is...

163
00:10:21,101 --> 00:10:22,560
Okay, what is it?

164
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:23,980
It's a...

165
00:10:24,197 --> 00:10:25,585
...tarantula!

166
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:34,843
God, Rachel, I'm sorry.
What was I thinking...

167
00:10:35,157 --> 00:10:38,182
...giving Joey this big, gross,
scary spider...

168
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:41,936
...in such a poorly constructed cage?

169
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,209
What are you talking about?
I love them.

170
00:10:46,534 --> 00:10:51,326
I had a tarantula when I was a kid.
But it died because my cat ate it.

171
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:54,214
And then my cat died.

172
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:56,414
But, Joey, isn't this cool?

173
00:10:56,658 --> 00:10:59,434
Is it on me?
I feel like it's on me. I got...

174
00:11:02,503 --> 00:11:03,962
Oh, isn't that adorable?

175
00:11:04,243 --> 00:11:07,267
Joey is afraid of the tarantula.

176
00:11:07,548 --> 00:11:08,936
He's so adorable.

177
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:10,323
God, he's just so much fun.

178
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,210
Joey's the best. I'm glad
you're having so much fun here.

179
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:14,637
Wait a minute.

180
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,063
What's the matter?

181
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,329
Our apartment is ready.

182
00:11:19,238 --> 00:11:23,093
And that makes you angry because...?

183
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,914
Because you'd rather
live here with Joey.

184
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:28,873
- Where did you get that?
- Monica and Chandler...

185
00:11:29,084 --> 00:11:31,445
...said that you were having
so much fun here...

186
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:36,380
...and apparently no amount of drums
or tarantula is gonna change that.

187
00:11:38,304 --> 00:11:40,735
Phoebe,
did you get all this stuff for Joey...

188
00:11:40,948 --> 00:11:43,024
...to try and drive me out
of the apartment?

189
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:46,650
You might as well have just
gotten him a fish.

190
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:49,185
You know how fish freak me out.

191
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:51,620
Fish.

192
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:56,222
But it wouldn't have mattered.
You and I are gonna live together.

193
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,889
We're roommates.
That's the deal.

194
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,732
Yes, but I wanted you to want
to live with me.

195
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,623
But, okay, if you're having
so much fun over here...

196
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:05,923
It's so much more fun with you.

197
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:08,839
- We did have fun, didn't we?
- We had so much fun.

198
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:11,597
Remember the time we were playing
with the SuperBall...

199
00:12:11,843 --> 00:12:15,248
...and we accidentally threw it through
the window and it broke?

200
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,799
I remember paying for the window,
but I don't remember how it broke.

201
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,288
Yeah, stuff like that.

202
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,865
Well, anyway, they say, if we want,
we could see it tonight.

203
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:29,164
- I would love to.
- Yay, okay!

204
00:12:29,447 --> 00:12:32,329
- Good, good, good.
- Great. All right. Good.

205
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:35,319
And Monica asked me
to make the drumming stop.

206
00:12:40,686 --> 00:12:42,109
Done.

207
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,675
Hello, sir.
You here to return those pants?

208
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,300
No, these are my pants.

209
00:13:02,118 --> 00:13:03,576
Okay.

210
00:13:03,995 --> 00:13:07,744
- How can I help you?
- Do you have a Santa outfit left?

211
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:10,144
Two days before Christmas?
Sorry, man.

212
00:13:10,363 --> 00:13:12,961
- Did you try Costume City?
- Yeah, I've tried everywhere.

213
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:16,786
- Please, please. I mean, I'll pay extra.
- Sorry. But...

214
00:13:17,008 --> 00:13:20,448
...I do have 74 of them
coming back on the 26th.

215
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:24,859
Okay, look.
Do you have anything Christmas-y?

216
00:13:25,114 --> 00:13:28,697
I promised my son, and I really
don't want to disappoint him.

217
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:31,965
Come on, you gotta have something.

218
00:13:32,803 --> 00:13:35,615
I'm the Holiday Armadillo!

219
00:13:37,952 --> 00:13:39,791
I'm a friend of Santa's...

220
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,814
...and he sent me here to wish you...

221
00:13:43,137 --> 00:13:46,162
...a merry Christmas!

222
00:13:46,963 --> 00:13:50,474
What happened to Santa,
Holiday Armadillo?

223
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:54,161
Santa was unavailable...

224
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:57,327
...so close to Christmas.

225
00:13:58,376 --> 00:13:59,835
Come in, have a seat.

226
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:03,969
You must be exhausted,
coming all the way from Texas.

227
00:14:07,143 --> 00:14:09,361
- Texas?
- That's right, Ben.

228
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,272
I'm Santa's representative...

229
00:14:11,596 --> 00:14:15,345
...for all the Southern states.

230
00:14:15,632 --> 00:14:18,692
And Mexico!

231
00:14:20,363 --> 00:14:21,822
But Santa sent me here...

232
00:14:22,138 --> 00:14:25,684
...to give you these presents, Ben.

233
00:14:26,035 --> 00:14:29,131
Maybe the lady will help me
with these presents.

234
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:45,856
Wow, thanks!

235
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:47,459
You're welcome, Ben.

236
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:49,998
Merry Christmas.

237
00:14:50,841 --> 00:14:54,174
And happy Hanukkah!

238
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:58,736
Are you for Hanukkah too?
Because I'm part Jewish.

239
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:02,311
You are? Me too.

240
00:15:03,123 --> 00:15:07,156
Because armadillos
also wandered in the desert?

241
00:15:09,177 --> 00:15:11,395
You want to wander in the hall?

242
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,257
Hey, Ben!

243
00:15:15,544 --> 00:15:17,655
What if the Holiday Armadillo...

244
00:15:17,944 --> 00:15:21,384
...told you all about
the Festival of Lights?

245
00:15:21,632 --> 00:15:22,568
Cool!

246
00:15:22,884 --> 00:15:24,414
Come on, Ben.

247
00:15:27,755 --> 00:15:30,080
Years and years ago...

248
00:15:30,434 --> 00:15:32,546
...there were these people called...

249
00:15:32,869 --> 00:15:34,886
...the Maccabees!
- Ho, ho, ho!

250
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,940
Merry Christmas!

251
00:15:39,863 --> 00:15:41,559
- Santa!
- Hey!

252
00:15:43,481 --> 00:15:46,186
What are you doing here, Santa?

253
00:15:48,387 --> 00:15:50,925
Well, I'm here to see
my old buddy Ben.

254
00:15:51,622 --> 00:15:53,354
What are you doing here...

255
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:57,391
...Weird Turtle Man?

256
00:15:59,277 --> 00:16:02,088
I'm the Holiday Armadillo...

257
00:16:02,373 --> 00:16:05,634
...your part-Jewish friend.

258
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:10,957
You sent me here
to give Ben some presents.

259
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,048
Remember?

260
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,487
What?

261
00:16:18,516 --> 00:16:20,627
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?

262
00:16:20,882 --> 00:16:22,471
You bet I did, Ben.

263
00:16:22,726 --> 00:16:24,743
Put her there.

264
00:16:29,093 --> 00:16:34,099
Well, it would have worked this time
if his hands weren't so damn small.

265
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:39,250
Ho, ho, ho!

266
00:16:39,496 --> 00:16:41,441
Ben, why don't you come open
more presents.

267
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:44,357
Santa, the armadillo and I
will have a talk in the kitchen.

268
00:16:45,062 --> 00:16:47,636
There's a sentence
I never thought I'd say.

269
00:16:49,446 --> 00:16:50,798
What are you doing?

270
00:16:51,082 --> 00:16:54,628
You called everyone and said you were
having trouble finding a Santa costume...

271
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,986
...so I borrowed one
from a guy at work.

272
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,672
Thank you, but you gotta leave.

273
00:17:00,023 --> 00:17:01,339
- Why?
- Because...

274
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:04,364
...I'm finally getting him excited
about Hanukkah...

275
00:17:04,615 --> 00:17:05,895
...and you're wrecking it.

276
00:17:06,181 --> 00:17:10,143
But I didn't get to shake my belly
like a bowlful of jelly.

277
00:17:13,452 --> 00:17:17,165
I'm sorry, Chandler,
but this is really important to me.

278
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:21,445
Fine, I'll give the suit back.

279
00:17:22,046 --> 00:17:25,652
Hey, you think you can keep it
another night?

280
00:17:28,064 --> 00:17:29,867
Santa? Really?

281
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,815
Yeah, is that okay?

282
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:35,673
Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?

283
00:17:36,971 --> 00:17:40,233
- No.
- Then it's okay!

284
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,651
Okay, Ben. Santa has to go.

285
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,389
Say goodbye.

286
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,208
No, why does he have to go?

287
00:17:48,522 --> 00:17:52,721
Because if Santa and the Holiday...

288
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:54,844
...Armadillo...

289
00:17:57,047 --> 00:17:59,443
...are ever in the same room
for too long...

290
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:02,750
...the universe will implode!

291
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:06,711
Merry Christmas!

292
00:18:08,215 --> 00:18:11,964
No, why can't the armadillo leave?
I want Santa.

293
00:18:14,442 --> 00:18:16,067
Fine, I give up. Santa...

294
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:18,822
Santa can stay!

295
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:21,781
Well, I'll stay...

296
00:18:22,027 --> 00:18:25,538
...but only because I want to hear
about Hanukkah.

297
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,911
Ben, will you sit here with Santa...

298
00:18:29,229 --> 00:18:31,305
...and learn about Hanukkah?

299
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,636
Okay, Santa.

300
00:18:34,586 --> 00:18:36,140
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

301
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:38,446
All right, it's time...

302
00:18:38,727 --> 00:18:41,953
...for the story of Hanukkah.

303
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:44,283
Years and years ago...

304
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:48,321
...there were these people
called the Maccabees!

305
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,935
Merry Christmas!

306
00:19:00,297 --> 00:19:04,295
Oh, wow, look at this place!

307
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,671
Oh, this is terrible.

308
00:19:08,926 --> 00:19:10,314
They've made so many changes...

309
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:13,860
...I can't even feel
my grandmother's presence anymore.

310
00:19:14,527 --> 00:19:16,579
Oh, new sconces!

311
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,320
- Oh, my God!
- What?

312
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,570
Okay, remember how you told me that
your grandmother put up that wall...

313
00:19:23,886 --> 00:19:25,962
...to make that into two bedrooms?
- Yeah.

314
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:28,469
And that the landlord
might find out...

315
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,809
...and then tear it down?
- Yeah?

316
00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:34,006
Do you really not know
where I'm going with this?

317
00:19:35,438 --> 00:19:37,869
No, of course I do. What?

318
00:19:39,334 --> 00:19:41,351
It left. It's one huge room.

319
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,647
Oh, no!

320
00:19:45,735 --> 00:19:47,811
Wow!

321
00:19:48,832 --> 00:19:49,804
See?

322
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:52,690
I guess we'll just have to
put the wall back up.

323
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:57,172
- You can't, because of the new skylight.
- There's a skylight?

324
00:19:57,773 --> 00:19:59,683
Wow!

325
00:20:00,244 --> 00:20:03,304
So, what should we do? Should
we start looking for a new place?

326
00:20:07,063 --> 00:20:08,343
You know, I'm sensing...

327
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:12,448
...that my grandmother
would not be comfortable with that.

328
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:15,438
Oh, yeah?

329
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:18,323
Starting to feel her again there,
are we?

330
00:20:19,345 --> 00:20:20,970
- A little bit. Yeah.
- Yeah.

331
00:20:22,302 --> 00:20:26,157
Pheebs, is your grandmother maybe
saying that you should live here alone?

332
00:20:26,407 --> 00:20:28,554
You heard it too? You have the gift.

333
00:20:30,408 --> 00:20:32,353
Phoebe, it's okay.

334
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,509
I like living with Joey.

335
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:37,219
- Are you sure?
- Please. I hate packing...

336
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:38,824
...it's closer to work.

337
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:40,980
And we do have fun.

338
00:20:42,238 --> 00:20:45,713
Although, I'm really gonna miss
living with you.

339
00:20:46,064 --> 00:20:48,496
- Oh, me too.
- I know.

340
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,485
Oh, wait. Did you hear that?

341
00:20:51,736 --> 00:20:54,238
Listen. I'm getting something
from your grandmother.

342
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:58,171
She said that since you get to keep
the one-bedroom apartment...

343
00:20:58,415 --> 00:21:01,535
...you should give Rachel
the purple chair.

344
00:21:04,226 --> 00:21:06,373
No, I do not hear that.

345
00:21:07,462 --> 00:21:09,787
Oh, no, wait a minute. Oh, okay.

346
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:15,078
She didn't say "chair," she said "share." You
should share the one-bedroom apartment.

347
00:21:15,324 --> 00:21:17,791
Oh, the purple chair.
No, yeah, I heard that.

348
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:23,951
And the miracle was that
that little bit of oil...

349
00:21:24,196 --> 00:21:28,016
...that should have lasted
just one day, burned for...

350
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:30,176
- Eight whole days.
- That's right.

351
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:34,316
And that's why we celebrate
Hanukkah today. The end.

352
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:36,440
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

353
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:37,867
My favorite part...

354
00:21:38,078 --> 00:21:42,491
...was when Superman
flew all the Jews out of Egypt.

355
00:21:46,463 --> 00:21:50,318
The armadillo was actually
not so thrilled about that part.

356
00:21:52,969 --> 00:21:56,159
Why is Santa kissing Aunt Monica?

357
00:21:56,448 --> 00:22:01,205
Because Aunt Monica
was very, very good this year.

358
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,421
Okay, Ben, it's time to light...

359
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:08,585
...the Hanukkah candles!

360
00:22:17,706 --> 00:22:18,880
Hey.

361
00:22:19,341 --> 00:22:23,303
Wow! Looks like the Easter Bunny's
funeral in here.

362
00:22:25,952 --> 00:22:28,727
Come on, come on.
We're lighting the candles.

363
00:22:33,571 --> 00:22:35,409
I understand why Superman is here...

364
00:22:35,624 --> 00:22:39,207
...but why is there a porcupine
at the Easter Bunny's funeral?

365
00:22:46,444 --> 00:22:48,911
- Did you get it?
- I got it.

366
00:22:49,157 --> 00:22:50,995
Is it back in the cage?

367
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,198
It's back in the cage.

368
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,174
Is the cage closed?

369
00:22:57,995 --> 00:23:01,744
Joey, will you just come out here
and stop being such a baby!
