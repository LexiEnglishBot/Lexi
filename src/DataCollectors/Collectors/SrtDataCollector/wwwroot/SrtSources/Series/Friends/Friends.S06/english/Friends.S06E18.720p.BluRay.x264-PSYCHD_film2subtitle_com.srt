1
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:03,794
Hey.

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:07,923
I just got my teacher evaluations.
Check out what this one student wrote.

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:12,344
"I loved Dr. Geller's class.
Mind-blowing lectures.

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:17,725
Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie
of the Paleontology Department."

5
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:21,020
Ah, "Hotties of
the Paleontology Department."

6
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,439
There's a big-selling calendar, huh?

7
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:25,899
Who wrote it?

8
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,652
I wish I knew,
but the evaluations are all anonymous.

9
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,904
- Do you still have their final exams?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:35,451
Match the evaluation to the exam with the
same handwriting and there's your admirer.

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,080
A hot girl's at stake
and all of a sudden he's Rain Man.

12
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:45,836
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Why are we so sure that this is a girl?

13
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,508
It's a girl.

14
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,428
Anyway, it wouldn't matter, okay?

15
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:58,474
- Because I'm a teacher. She's a student.
- Oh, is that against the rules?

16
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,267
- No, but it is frowned upon.
- I see.

17
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:04,146
- Besides, there's a big age difference.
- Think of it like this. When you're 90...

18
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,981
I know, when I'm 90, she'll be 80...

19
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,317
...and it won't seem
like such a big difference.

20
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,237
No, that's not what I was gonna say
at all.

21
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,783
What I was gonna say is
when you're 90...

22
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,620
...you'll still have the memory
of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.

23
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:03,997
Chandler, you know that girl you went to
college with who became a movie director?

24
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:07,543
Oh, yeah, Dana Keystone.
She was in my movement class.

25
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,795
What's a movement class?

26
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,340
It's Chandler's way
of pretending he didn't take mime.

27
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:17,678
Listen, anyway,
she's directing the new Al Pacino movie.

28
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:21,306
- You gotta get me an audition.
- Oh. I haven't talked to her in like 10 years.

29
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,434
Oh, no, no, no. Please, Chandler,
I would owe you so much.

30
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,813
You do owe me so much.
You owe me 3400...

31
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,650
Hey, hey, dude.
Why you changing the subject? What?

32
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,736
- Will you make the call or what?
- Okay, I'll try.

33
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,655
All right. Thanks, you're the best.

34
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,075
The last day of auditions is Thursday,
so I gotta get in by Thursday.

35
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,120
Just remember Thursday. Thursday.
Can you remember Thursday?

36
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,539
Yeah, so Tuesday?

37
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:51,336
Thursday. Look, if you need help
remembering, just think of it like this.

38
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,381
The third day. All right?
Monday, one day.

39
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,592
Tuesday, two day.

40
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,470
Wednesday, when, huh, what day?
Thursday.

41
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,223
The third day, okay?

42
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,934
- Thank you.
- Okay.

43
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,315
- Hey, Mon, I'm gonna check my messages.
- You just thought of that in there?

44
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,359
Sure, you know, nature called.
She wants to see who else did.

45
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,363
Hello?

46
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,907
Uh...

47
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,283
Rachel.

48
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,952
You guys, someone is in our apartment.
Call the cops.

49
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,413
You're on the phone.

50
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,582
- Oh, my God.
- What?

51
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,835
Oh, my God. Thank you.
That was the Fire Department.

52
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:35,464
- There was a fire at our place.
- Oh, my God. How bad was it?

53
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,759
He didn't say, but it was a fire.
I'm guessing not very good.

54
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,178
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Phoebe, come on.

55
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,724
What are you smiling about?
What is so funny?

56
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:50,479
The part I wanna audition for is a fireman.
This is so meant to be.

57
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:03,450
Wow. Looks like you were very generous
with your grades this semester.

58
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,625
- Professor Geller?
- Yeah? Huh?

59
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,503
I wanted to say
how much I enjoyed your class.

60
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,547
Oh, thank you. Thanks very much. Ow.

61
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:22,219
I'm a little embarrassed about calling you
a hottie on my evaluation.

62
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,638
- That was you?
- Yeah.

63
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,558
I felt a little weird about it.
You're a teacher. I'm a student.

64
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,604
But would you maybe wanna go out
with me sometime?

65
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,983
Oh, I... Heh.
I don't think that would be the best idea.

66
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,112
Oh, because I was thinking, um,
the semester's over.

67
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,948
- You're not my teacher anymore.
- What time?

68
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,371
Oh, you know what? Forget it.
I see you already gave me an A.

69
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,959
- Gotcha.
- I'm kidding. Ha-ha-ha.

70
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,711
- Oh. Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

71
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,213
So seriously, what time?

72
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,762
Coming through. Oh.
Coming through. Oh. Hello. Hi.

73
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,724
No, right. Coming through.

74
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,684
- Oh.
- Okay. Well, it's not so bad.

75
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,978
Most of the damage
was contained to the bedrooms.

76
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,187
Oh, my God.

77
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,566
Hey, buddy, you think I could borrow
your uniform this Thursday?

78
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,361
- Excuse me?
- Joey. He's working.

79
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,031
You would look good in that.

80
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,618
- Uh-oh. How bad is it?
- Oh, it's bad, it's really bad.

81
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:34,416
The only thing that isn't burned is an ax,
which I do not remember buying.

82
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,835
- How's your room, Rach?
- Everything's ruined.

83
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,546
My bed, my clothes.
Look at my favorite blue sweater.

84
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,756
Isn't that mine?

85
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,426
Fine. I'm sorry for your loss.

86
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,513
You're not gonna be able to live here
for a while.

87
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,767
- You ladies have a place to stay?
- Oh. Wow.

88
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:55,270
Okay, look, pal...

89
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,398
...I am not in the mood
to be hit on right now.

90
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,777
But if you give me your number,
I will call you some other time.

91
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,490
Yes, they can stay with us.

92
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,284
Have you figured out what started the fire,
Mr. Fireman?

93
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,746
Well, uh, do either of you smoke?

94
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:13,955
No, not usually.

95
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,416
- But yeah, I could use one now. Thanks.
- No, no.

96
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:20,837
- Do you light candles, burn incense?
- Yes, I do all the time. I love them.

97
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,800
Oh, my God, I did it. It's me, it's me.

98
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,719
I burned down the house.
I burned down the house!

99
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,264
Okay, Phoebe, calm down.
There's no need to place blame. Okay?

100
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,059
I warned her about those candles.

101
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,524
It's great to catch up.
I can't believe how long it's been.

102
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,235
Hey, Chandler, is that?

103
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,156
- Oh, that's great. Good for you.
- So, hey, hey, is it?

104
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,829
Okay, so, yeah,
maybe we can get together, um...

105
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,753
Can you hold on for one second, please?

106
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,463
What?

107
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,508
When you're off the phone,
you wanna get a pizza?

108
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,927
Hi, I'm back.

109
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:14,141
Yeah, that sounds great.
Okay, well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye.

110
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:20,105
Hey, listen, so when's my audition?
I know it's Thursday, but what time?

111
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,442
Hi. We didn't get to the audition.

112
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,319
- I'm gonna take her to coffee and do it then.
- Ah.

113
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,114
Wow, so now you're going on a date
with this girl?

114
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,450
Not a date.
I haven't talked to her in 10 years.

115
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,245
You can't call somebody you haven't
talked to in 10 years and ask for a favor.

116
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,914
There are rules, you know?
You gotta put in some time.

117
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,332
You're right, I'm sorry.

118
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,003
- It's not like you're going out with an ex.
- No, we only went out once.

119
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,046
You dated her?

120
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,716
Not once.

121
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:53,346
Great. Why don't I just go out with an ex,
you know, and do Joey a favor?

122
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,725
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor?
Maybe you go out with Joey.

123
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,986
Oh. That's great.
My friend Joey's in the movie business.

124
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,573
Mm. You know who I ran into from school?
Howie.

125
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,576
- Hmm. My friend's name is Joey.
- Heh.

126
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,162
Apparently, Howie's editing now.

127
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,625
Yeah, he calls me up
and asks me if he can edit my new movie.

128
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,168
Heh. Can you believe that?

129
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,087
You know,
I haven't spoken to him in, what, 10 years...

130
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,090
...and he asks me for a favor?

131
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,513
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.

132
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,057
No "How you doing?" Heh.

133
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,393
Man, I mean,
not even a cup of coffee first.

134
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,395
- Heh. The nerve, huh?
- Yeah.

135
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,939
Refill?

136
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,485
Now, this is last-minute,
so I want to apologize for the mess.

137
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,154
- Oh.
- Who cares?

138
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,408
Oh, my God.

139
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,786
It sure didn't look this way
when I lived here.

140
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,412
I know.

141
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,582
There's one problem, though.

142
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,545
There's only room for one, so I guess
one of you will have to stay at Joey's.

143
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:10,840
Well, since the fire was kind of my fault,
I guess you should get to stay here.

144
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,384
Hey, hey, hey, now.

145
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,679
This was no one's fault, Pheebs, okay?
It was an accident.

146
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,973
It was my fault.
You should get the nice room.

147
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,475
Okay. Whoo!

148
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,894
So, Rach,
you're the first guest at Hotel Monica.

149
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,104
Hotel Monica.

150
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,398
Just tell me how you like your eggs.

151
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,650
I thought I'd bring them to you,
you know, in bed.

152
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,402
- Aw.
- You've been through so much.

153
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,611
I have.

154
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,408
This right here is where I keep the pizza.

155
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,703
And that's where the napkin is.

156
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,957
- What's that smell?
- I know. I don't...

157
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:51,923
Oh, please, it was such a big class.
You never even noticed me.

158
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:56,386
What? Of course I did.
You sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.

159
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,596
Who?

160
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,265
Oh. I had trouble
remembering everyone's names...

161
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,891
...so I came up with nicknames.

162
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:06,271
Like the guy on the other side of you
was Smelly von Brown-Shirt.

163
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,524
Oh, yeah. Ha, ha.

164
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:14,321
- So, um, did you have a nickname for me?
- Uh, no. No.

165
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,406
Yes, you did. What was it?

166
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,200
Um, it's...

167
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,869
Cutie McPretty.

168
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,873
Oh, that's so sweet.

169
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,376
Listen, I gotta tell you,
I'm having a great time.

170
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,505
You know how you said it might be weird,
the whole student-teacher thing?

171
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:38,011
And to be frank, I thought it would be too.
But it's not. I mean, it's not at all.

172
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,434
- Dr. Geller.
- Burt.

173
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,272
So did you sleep well last night?

174
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,482
- I did.
- Yeah?

175
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,985
I did. Monica was so sweet.
She left a little mint on my pillow.

176
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,488
- Know what Joey left on my pillow?
- What?

177
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,864
Gum.

178
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:04,287
- Well, we determined the cause of the fire.
- Yeah, I know. It was my candle, my candle.

179
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,207
No, there was an appliance left on
in the bathroom.

180
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,875
It looks like a curling iron.

181
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,544
- I don't use a curling iron.
- Well, someone does.

182
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,674
Don't look at me, my hair's straight.
Straight, straight, straight.

183
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,552
- It could've been a hair-straightener.
- Oh.

184
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,099
This is where I keep the pizza.

185
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,143
And... Hey, where'd the napkin go?

186
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,071
There you go. I wouldn't want
my best guest to strain her eyes.

187
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,865
Thanks, Monica.

188
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,702
- Does that smell bother you?
- What, the smell from Joey's?

189
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,745
No, I can hardly smell it over here.

190
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,917
Well, you let me know if you can.
Because I can bake a pie to cover it.

191
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,921
- I can smell it a little. Bake the pie.
- Okay.

192
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,427
Hello?

193
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,471
Oh, yes, one minute, please.
It's for you. It's the fire inspector.

194
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,642
Oh. Hello? Yeah, this is Phoebe.

195
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,852
Really?

196
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,814
Yeah, so it turns
out that it wasn't the hair-straightener...

197
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,899
...that started the fire.

198
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,402
No, no. It was the candles.

199
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,072
Yeah. It's very not good
leaving candles unattended.

200
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,910
In fact, one of the first things
they teach you in fire school is...

201
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,412
Uh...

202
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,417
Uh, okay, well, I have to go now.

203
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,383
We had such a great time.
She's incredible.

204
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,553
I thought the age difference
might be a problem, but it wasn't.

205
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,931
It wasn't at all.
Elizabeth is very mature for her age.

206
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,689
A concept lost on some people.

207
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,524
So it's okay to date a student?

208
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,859
Well, not really.

209
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,779
I mean, technically,
it's not against the rules or anything.

210
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,197
But it is frowned upon...

211
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,866
...especially by that professor
we ran into last night.

212
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,951
Judgy von Holier-Than-Thou.

213
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,080
Just be careful, okay?

214
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:15,001
You don't wanna get a reputation
as Professor McNails-His-Students. Ha, ha.

215
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:21,382
- Yeah. What should I do?
- Well, Ross, it seems pretty clear.

216
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,094
I mean, what's more important,
what people think or how you feel? Huh?

217
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,515
- Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
- Joey, that is so sweet.

218
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,314
- Hey.
- Hey, hey. So how'd it go with Dana?

219
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:40,235
Any reason I should leave a block
of time open, say, Thursday?

220
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,821
- I couldn't do it.
- You couldn't do it?

221
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,448
Relax, I just need more time.
We're going to dinner.

222
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,492
What? You're going out with her again?

223
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,413
- Going out with who?
- Dana Keystone, from college.

224
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,708
Oh, yeah. Wasn't she, uh, mm?

225
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,461
No, that was Dana Kaplan.

226
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,548
- Oh.
- Ah.

227
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,300
- Joey, you didn't even know her.
- Yeah, whatever.

228
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,390
Great story again.

229
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,433
The yarns that you weave.

230
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,019
Ha-ha-ha. Woo-hoo!

231
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,523
You know, uh, actually,
I should get going.

232
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,859
Oh, no, no, no, stay, stay,
because you should...

233
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,777
You should stay.

234
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,613
Wow.

235
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,616
Oh, I am really flattered.

236
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:33,204
But I just...
I don't feel that way about you.

237
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,333
- Oh, no, no, no. That's not... No, no, no.
- I'm sorry, Chandler.

238
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:42,130
You know, you are such a sweet guy,
and I don't wanna hurt you.

239
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,508
Oh, I wish there were something I could do
to make you feel better.

240
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,177
No, no, no... Really?

241
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,596
Of course.

242
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,433
Well, it just hurts so bad, I, uh...

243
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,852
Oh, I'm sorry.

244
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,398
- Well, maybe there is one thing you can do.
- What? Anything. Anything.

245
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,069
Well, I mean, this is just off the top
of my head now. Um...

246
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,448
Ahem. But I have this friend, uh,
this actor friend...

247
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:12,535
...and he would kill me
if he knew that I was doing this, um...

248
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:18,207
...but, um, would it be possible for him
to get an audition for your movie...

249
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,376
...say, on Thursday?

250
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,921
Absolutely.

251
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:27,175
But you'd really feel better
about me rejecting you...

252
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,510
...if your friend can audition
for my movie?

253
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,847
Well, the heart wants what it wants.
I'll see you later.

254
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,648
Hey. How's it going?

255
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,858
Well, not much has changed
in the last five minutes.

256
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,278
Yes, it has. I made cookies.

257
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,448
That's all right. I'm still full
from your homemade potato chips, so...

258
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,994
Oh. But you should eat them now
because they're hot from the oven.

259
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,040
- Okay.
- Oh. But not in here.

260
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,876
Can't eat them in bed, remember?
No crummies.

261
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,211
Oh.

262
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,296
I'll be out in a second.

263
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,923
Okay.

264
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,725
- What are you doing?
- This doesn't lock, does it?

265
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:28,403
- Oh. Joey, sorry. Oh.
- Oh, it's all right, don't worry about it.

266
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,072
No, but look.
Oh, that's gonna leave a stain.

267
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,284
Rach, hey, it's fine. You're at Joey's.

268
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,413
- Really?
- Yeah, look.

269
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,501
- Huh.
- Yeah.

270
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:47,296
- I've never lived like this before.
- I know.

271
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,758
Whoo! Ha-ha-ha.

272
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,803
All right, well, don't waste it.
I mean, it's still food.

273
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,854
What do you wanna do now, huh?
You wanna go get a drink?

274
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,147
Uh, I can't.

275
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:08,776
- Oh, you have some studying to do?
- No, I have some turning 21 to do.

276
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,403
Okay. Ha, ha.

277
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,531
You know, I remember
when I was in college, we used to...

278
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,786
- What are you doing?
- Nothing, I'm just...

279
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,873
I'm so comfortable with you.

280
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,170
- Do you not wanna be seen with me?
- What?

281
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,714
No, of course I do. Are they gone?

282
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,093
No, they're still here.
But I think I'm about to leave.

283
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,263
What? No, no, wait, wait.

284
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,933
You're right, this is stupid.
Who cares what people think?

285
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:45,605
I mean, we like each other, right?
There's nothing wrong with that.

286
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,774
Come on.

287
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:54,405
Burt. Lydia. Mel.

288
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,117
- This is Elizabeth.
- Hi.

289
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,787
Aren't you in my Popular Culture class?

290
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,456
That's right, Lydia.
Elizabeth here is a student.

291
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,333
And we're dating.

292
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,502
And you may frown upon that...

293
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:11,464
...but we're not gonna hide it anymore.

294
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,134
You are so fired.

295
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,554
- What?
- They're gonna fire you.

296
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,307
You can't date a student.
It's against the rules.

297
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,268
Really? It's not just frowned upon?

298
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,773
- Oh. Ah.
- Ah!

299
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,484
I love it at Joey's.

300
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,194
There you go.

301
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,739
- Ooh. Thanks.
- Nice.

302
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,992
- So you busy Thursday?
- Oh, very funny.

303
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,496
I don't know if you remember, but my
audition was supposed to be Thursday.

304
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,251
You got me the audition?

305
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,086
- Yeah.
- Oh, let's hug it up.

306
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,713
Okay, okay, okay.

307
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,383
What are you gonna do to me
if you get the part?

308
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,468
- Hey.
- Hey.

309
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,678
- Hi.
- Hi.

310
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,847
- Yeah, okay, I need to talk to you.
Uh-huh.

311
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:04,183
Now, I know that they said
that the hair-straightener started the fire...

312
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,435
...but I think I'm partly at fault.

313
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:12,066
You see, I didn't tell you,
but, um, I had recently refilled the tissues.

314
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,069
And so, you know,
let's face it, that's just kindling.

315
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,322
So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.

316
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,117
No, no, no, Phoebe, this was my fault.

317
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,120
- Besides, you know what? I'm fine here.
- Okay.

318
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,498
- Oh, Chandler, Monica's looking for you.
- Really?

319
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,961
- Yeah, she said something about crummies.
- No, no, no. I was so careful.

320
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,716
Okay. You have to switch with me.
Monica is driving me crazy.

321
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,803
That's right.
All the ladies wanna stay at Joey's.

322
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,390
No, Phoebe, come on,
I don't wanna switch.

323
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,310
Please. Come on,
I can throw wet paper towels here.

324
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:51,522
No, but at Monica's,
you can eat cookies over the sink.

325
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,193
I know. I'm sorry.

326
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,070
All right, fine.

327
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,656
- This looks like so much fun.
- Ha, ha.

328
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,159
God, what a mess.

329
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,792
Wow, it actually is in the handbook.

330
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,589
I can't date you
or have a hot plate in my office.

331
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,886
Oh, I can't believe
we have to stop seeing each other.

332
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,807
For what it's worth,
I did appreciate you standing up for me.

333
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,894
That felt really nice.

334
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,480
Kind of made me like you even more.

335
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:36,817
I know, I know. I really like you too.
But we can't date.

336
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,403
It's against the rules. It's forbidden.

337
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,906
Wow.

338
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,866
- What?
- Just hearing you describe it...

339
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:49,247
...as forbidden, it's really hot.

340
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,416
Really?

341
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,418
Yeah.

342
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:59,590
Well, I don't care how hot it is, it's, uh...
It's wrong.

343
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,221
- Stop it.
- No, no. It's wrong. It's...

344
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,348
It's naughty.

345
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,809
It's...

346
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,769
...taboo.

347
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,355
Shut the book.

348
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:19,318
- Hey. Let's also get a hot plate.
- Oh.

349
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,909
- Hey.
- Hey.

350
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,745
- So?
- So?

351
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:33,165
- It's Thursday. How was the audition?
- It's Thur...?

352
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,168
Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day.
Wednesday, when, huh, what day? Thur...

353
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,214
Oh!
