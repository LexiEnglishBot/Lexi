1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,130
Friends, family,
we're gathered to celebrate here today...

2
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:09,008
...the joyous union of Ross and Emily.

3
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:12,511
Now Ross, repeat after me.

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,263
I, Ross.

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,597
I, Ross.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,558
Take thee, Emily.

7
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,226
Take thee, Rachel.

8
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,398
Emily.

9
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,402
Heh. Emily.

10
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,530
Uh, shall I go on?

11
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,866
He said "Rachel," right?

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,243
Do you think I should go up there?

13
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,871
Yes. Yes. Do go on.

14
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,373
I think we'd better start again.

15
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,126
Ross, repeat after me.

16
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,129
I, Ross.

17
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:54,845
Take thee, Emily.

18
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,891
Ha, ha. Like there'd be anybody else.

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,271
As my lawfully wedded wife,
in sickness and in health...

20
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,065
...till death parts us.

21
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:11,111
As my lawfully wedded wife,
in sickness and in health...

22
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,947
...until death parts us.

23
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,325
Really, I do. Emily.

24
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,577
Do you have the rings?

25
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:23,248
Emily, place this ring on Ross' finger...

26
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,293
...as a symbol of your bond everlasting.

27
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,259
Ross, place this ring...

28
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,678
...on Emily's hand as a symbol...

29
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,264
...of the love that encircles you forever.

30
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,225
Happy to.

31
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,437
They have made their declarations...

32
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:50,275
...and it gives me great pleasure
to declare them husband and wife.

33
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,530
You may kiss the bride.

34
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,496
This is worse than when
he married the lesbian.

35
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,627
Just keep smiling.

36
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,003
Okay...

37
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,217
Well, that went well. Yeah.

38
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,887
It could've been worse.
He could've shot her.

39
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,976
Ha, ha. That was pretty funny, wasn't it?

40
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,821
You spoiled everything.
It's like a nightmare.

41
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,074
All my friends and family are out there.
How can I face them?

42
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,701
How could you do this to me?

43
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,037
Hey, no matter what happens
with Ross and Emily...

44
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,705
...we still get cake, right?

45
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,835
That's all right.
No, no. You take your time, sweetie.

46
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:35,088
I'll be out here. Ha, ha.

47
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,966
She's just fixing her makeup.

48
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,134
I hate you.

49
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,095
And I love you.

50
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,892
Boy, a bad time
to say the wrong name, huh, Ross?

51
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,521
That's true. Thanks, Dad.

52
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,567
People should be dancing, huh?

53
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,570
Hey, this is a party. Come on.

54
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,239
Joey. Dance.

55
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,461
Yes, Waltham Interiors.

56
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:19,258
Hello, this is Ross Geller's
personal physician, Dr. Phalange.

57
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,135
Who?

58
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:26,181
Yeah, I discovered that Ross forgot
to take his brain medicine.

59
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,934
Um, now, without it, uh,
in the brain of Ross...

60
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,229
...uh, women's names are interchangeable.

61
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,856
Through no fault of his own.

62
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,942
Oh, my God. Phoebe.

63
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,488
No, not Phoebe. Dr. Phalange.

64
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,699
Oh, no. You have it too.

65
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,952
Hello?

66
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,251
- Hey.
- Hey.

67
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,130
Wow, I hope you don't take this
the wrong way...

68
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:02,050
...but I know we had plans
to meet up tonight and...

69
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,804
Ugh. I'm just kind of worried
about what it might do to our friendship.

70
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,223
I know.

71
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:12,311
- Ugh. How could we have let this happen?
- Seven times.

72
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,274
You know, look. We were away.

73
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,819
- In a foreign, romantic country.
- Right.

74
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,321
I blame London.

75
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,989
Bad London.

76
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,658
So look, um...

77
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,912
...while we're still in London,
I mean, we can keep doing it, right?

78
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,582
Well, I don't see that we have a choice.

79
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,752
But when we're back home,
we don't do it.

80
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,378
Only here.

81
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,341
You know,
I saw a wine cellar downstairs.

82
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,469
- I'll meet you there in two minutes.
- Okay.

83
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,891
- Mon? Mon, I got to ask you something.
- Now?

84
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,560
Ross said my name up there.
I mean, come on.

85
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,437
I can't just pretend that didn't happen.

86
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,314
I don't know.

87
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:02,361
- Monica, what should I do?
- Just do the right thing.

88
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,946
What?

89
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:08,241
Tow the line. Thread the needle.
Think outside the box.

90
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:11,661
Monica, wait, listen. I'm gonna talk to Ross
about what he thinks it meant.

91
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,164
Wait. Rachel, no.

92
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,457
He's married.

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,209
Married.

94
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,628
If you don't realize that, I can't help you.

95
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,631
Okay. You're right.

96
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,717
You're right. You can't help me.

97
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,472
Jack, is it all our fault?
Were we bad parents?

98
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,391
Yes.

99
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,769
Oh yeah? Well, who serves steak
when there's no place to sit?

100
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,604
I mean,
how are you supposed to eat this?

101
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,231
Hey, what's up?

102
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,402
Where were you?
We were supposed to meet.

103
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,529
- Forget it. That's off.
- Why?

104
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,824
The next tour of the wine cellar...

105
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:53,245
...will commence in two minutes.

106
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,623
Joey, what are you doing?

107
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,042
You promised Phoebe
no meat till she has the babies.

108
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,003
Well, I figured we're in another country,
so it doesn't count.

109
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,589
- That's true.
- The man's got a point.

110
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,969
Oh, hi.

111
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,429
- Hi.
- Hi.

112
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,305
I'm sorry things
aren't working out so well.

113
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:16,810
Oh, no. Ha, ha. It could be better.
It's gonna be okay, right?

114
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,063
Oh, yeah. Of course. I mean,
she's gonna get over this, you know?

115
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,815
I mean, so you said my name.

116
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,651
You know, you just said it
because you saw me there.

117
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,529
If you'd seen a circus freak,
you would've said:

118
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,656
I take thee Circus Freak.

119
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,660
It didn't mean anything.
It's just a mistake.

120
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,954
It didn't mean anything.

121
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,873
- Right?
- No, no.

122
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,375
Of course it didn't mean anything.

123
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,337
I mean, I can understand why Emily
would think it meant something...

124
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,214
...you know, because it was you.

125
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:50,177
But it absolutely didn't.
It didn't! It didn't!

126
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,473
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside
for your first dance with Emily.

127
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,309
Oh. Oh, the band's ready.

128
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,061
Well, we got to do what the band says.

129
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,355
I don't care about the stupid band!

130
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,984
You spit on me, man.

131
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,112
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,115
- Emily is taking kind of a long time, huh?
- Heh.

133
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,451
When I locked myself in the bathroom
at my wedding...

134
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,579
...it was because I was trying
to pop the window out of the frame.

135
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,040
- Right.
- Get the hell out of there. You know?

136
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,507
Emily.

137
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,217
I'm coming in.

138
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:36,056
Oh, look at that. Same thing.

139
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,269
In the middle of everything...

140
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,606
...if I scream the word "yippee,"
just ignore me.

141
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,695
- Huh! Oh, my God. Rachel.
- Oh, hello, Rachel.

142
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,865
Ross said my name.

143
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,408
Okay? My name.

144
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,494
Ross said my name up there.

145
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,163
That obviously means
that he still loves me.

146
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,291
Okay, don't believe me. I know I'm right.

147
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,710
All right. Do you guys want to go
and get a drink?

148
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,587
Yes, we do.

149
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,840
But we have to change first.

150
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,717
Yes, I want to change.

151
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,763
- Why don't you go get a table?
- We'll be down in five minutes.

152
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,807
- Fifteen minutes.
- Ha, ha.

153
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,271
Hello.

154
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,939
Oh, Pheebs. It's Phoebe.

155
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,399
- Oh, hey, hey.
- Oh, great.

156
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,900
Hi.

157
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,610
So, what happened?

158
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,320
Well, Ross said my name.

159
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,490
Yeah, I know,
but I don't think that means anything.

160
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,450
Okay, Pheebs,
let's look at this objectively.

161
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,494
All right, ninth grade, right?

162
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,162
The obsession starts.

163
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,457
All right? Summer after ninth grade...

164
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,459
...he sees me in a two-piece
for the first time.

165
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,962
His obsession begins to grow, right?

166
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,423
Hey, listen, why don't we go change
in my room?

167
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,634
My clothes are... Oh.

168
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,234
- Wow, you look...
- No time for that.

169
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,902
Okay.

170
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,659
Hey, dude. Let me in.
I got a girl out here.

171
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,495
Well, I've got a girl in here.

172
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,374
No, you don't.
I just saw you go in there with Monica.

173
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,712
Well, we're hanging out in here.

174
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,133
Which one of us is gonna be
having sex in there? Me or you?

175
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,262
Well, I suppose I would have to say you.

176
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,808
- What if we're watching a movie in here?
- Which we are.

177
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,520
And we've already paid for it.
It's My Giant.

178
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:52,025
My Giant? I love that movie.

179
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,073
You really think this is okay?

180
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,742
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.

181
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,953
Oh, it's so beautiful.

182
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,455
Oh.

183
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,374
You know, I don't feel right about this.

184
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,875
Oh, Monica...

185
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,253
This is the honeymoon suite.

186
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,881
The room expects sex.

187
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,470
The room would be disappointed
if it didn't get sex.

188
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,723
All the other honeymoon suites
would think it was a loser.

189
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,435
Okay.

190
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,649
- Emily?
- Nope. Not under here.

191
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,862
- You didn't find her?
- No, I've looked everywhere.

192
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,699
Well, you couldn't have,
or else you would've found her.

193
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,576
- I think you should keep looking.
- Yeah. For about, uh, 30 minutes?

194
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,412
Or 45?

195
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,583
Wow, in 45 minutes,
you could find her twice.

196
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,589
No. For all I know,
she's trying to find me...

197
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,259
...but couldn't because
I kept moving around.

198
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,137
No, from now on,
I'm staying in one place.

199
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,972
Right here.

200
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,185
- It's getting late.
- Yeah, We're going to go.

201
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,854
Actually...

202
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,107
...do you guys mind
staying here for a while?

203
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,861
Ugh. You know, we got to get up early
and catch that plane to New York.

204
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,196
Yeah, it's a very large plane.

205
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,409
That's cool.

206
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,330
But we'll stay here with you.

207
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,958
Thanks, guys. Ha, ha.

208
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,630
I really appreciate this, you know,
but you don't need to rub my butt.

209
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,312
We have to leave for New York
in an hour.

210
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,190
I know. I've been looking at those doors.

211
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:58,276
They look pretty soundproof,
don't you think?

212
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,112
We can't do that. That's insane.

213
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,783
I mean, A, he could wake up.
And B, you know...

214
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,409
...let's go for it.

215
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,500
Emily? Emily.

216
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,379
- Emily!
- Nope.

217
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,258
- Forget about Emily. She's not with us.
- We've come for her things.

218
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,511
Where is she?

219
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:29,015
She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated.
She doesn't want to see you ever again.

220
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:34,354
We're very sad that it didn't work out
between you and Emily, monkey.

221
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,609
But I think you're absolutely delicious.

222
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:44,364
Excuse me, I'm standing right here.

223
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,991
Oh, yes.

224
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,285
There you are.

225
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,124
Hey. Hey, you guys. Hurry up. Get some.
There's a whole cart outside.

226
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,545
- Goodbye, Geller.
- Now, hold on. Hold on.

227
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,547
Look, look. Your daughter and I...

228
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,966
...are supposed to leave tonight
for our honeymoon.

229
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,052
Now, you tell her that
I'm gonna be at that airport...

230
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,221
...and I hope that she'll be there too.

231
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,808
Yeah, I said Rachel's name,
but it didn't mean anything.

232
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,687
She's just a friend. That's all.
Now, look, just tell Emily I love her...

233
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,815
...and that I can't imagine spending my life
with anyone else.

234
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,443
Please, promise me that
you'll tell her that.

235
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,572
All right, I'll tell her.

236
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,074
Come on, bugger face.

237
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,159
Call me.

238
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,662
You spend half your life in the bathroom.

239
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,540
Why do you never go out
the bloody window?

240
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:56,227
Well, maybe it's best
we never got to do it again.

241
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,856
Yeah, it kind of makes
that one night special.

242
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:07,280
You know, technically,
we still are over international waters.

243
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,909
I'm going to the bathroom.
Maybe I'll see you there in a bit?

244
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,410
Okay.

245
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,336
Hey, can I ask you something?

246
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,671
Uh, no.

247
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:29,177
Felicity and I, we were watching My Giant.
And I was thinking...

248
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,805
...I'm never gonna be as good an actor
as that giant.

249
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:36,684
Do you think I'm just wasting my life
with this acting thing?

250
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,852
No.

251
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,355
I mean, the giant's like five years
younger than me.

252
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,273
You know, you think I'll ever get there?

253
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,401
Yes.

254
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,822
- Thanks, man.
- Okay, man.

255
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,867
But what about how much taller
he is than me?

256
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,956
I mean, there's no way
I can make myself taller now.

257
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,000
And who knows what science
will come up with in the future...

258
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:05,880
...but, Chandler, what if I die
an unsuccessful, regular-size man?

259
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,885
Hey, Monica. Wow, you've been
in the bathroom for, like, a half-hour.

260
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,638
I know.

261
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,640
Had the beef tips, huh?

262
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,362
Hey.

263
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,284
You ate meat!

264
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,371
You had sex!

265
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,709
- No, we didn't.
- I know you didn't.

266
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,169
I was talking about Monica.

267
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,047
Phoebe, I did not have sex.

268
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:51,134
Oh, this pregnancy
is throwing me all off.

269
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,095
- I'm gonna say hi to the chick and duck.
- Oh, me too.

270
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,306
Why would you need to say hi?
You've been feeding them for four days.

271
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,560
Oh, right. Maybe I'll just go home.

272
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,488
Well, we certainly are alone.

273
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,824
Good thing we have that
"not New York" rule.

274
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,409
Right.

275
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,996
Um, listen, since we're on that subject...

276
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,666
...um, I just wanted to tell you that,
um...

277
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,586
Well, I was going through
a really hard time in London...

278
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:30,757
...what with my brother getting married
and that guy thinking I was Ross' mother.

279
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,091
Right.

280
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,636
Well, anyway, I just...

281
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,432
That night meant a lot to me.
And I guess I'm trying to say thanks.

282
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,933
Oh.

283
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,105
You know,
that night meant a lot to me too.

284
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,858
And it wasn't because I was
in a bad place or anything.

285
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:53,029
It just meant a lot to me
because you're really hot.

286
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,036
- Is that okay?
- Ha, ha. That's okay.

287
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,121
And I'm cute too?

288
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,585
- And you're cute too.
- Thank you.

289
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,797
- All right, I got to go unpack.
- Okay.

290
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,384
Bye.

291
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,650
I'm still on London time.
Does that count?

292
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,403
- Oh, that counts.
- Oh, good.

293
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,955
Rach.

294
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,040
- Rach.
- Hi.

295
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,792
What are you doing here?

296
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,379
Well, I've been on standby
for a flight home for hours.

297
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,423
- Oh.
- Oh. So no sign of Emily, huh?

298
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,384
Not yet.

299
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,555
So, um...

300
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,307
What time are you supposed to leave?

301
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,395
This is the last call
for Flight 1066 to Athens.

302
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,063
The last call.

303
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,274
Pretty soon, I guess.

304
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,319
I'm sorry.

305
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,574
I just... I don't understand.
I mean, how could she do this?

306
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,201
What, am I like a complete idiot...

307
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,412
...for thinking she'd actually show up?

308
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,872
No.

309
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,207
You're not an idiot, Ross.

310
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,209
You're a guy very much in love.

311
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,587
Same difference.

312
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:37,884
All passengers for Flight 1066
to Athens should now be on board.

313
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,927
I get it!

314
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,850
Well, that's that.

315
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,144
No, you know what?

316
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,645
I think you should go.

317
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,940
- What?
- Yeah, I do think you should go...

318
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,776
...by yourself. Get some distance.

319
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,487
Clear your head.
I think it would be really good.

320
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,448
Oh, I don't know.

321
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,409
Oh, come on, Ross.
I think it would be really good for you.

322
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,622
I could. I could do that.

323
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,165
Yeah.

324
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,084
I can't even believe her.

325
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,253
You know what? I am going to go.

326
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,504
- Good.
- Why not?

327
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,381
- Right?
- Right. Right.

328
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,134
- Thanks.
- Okay, I'll see you back at home.

329
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,386
If I ever get a flight out of here.

330
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,971
Hey, well...

331
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,600
- No.
- What? Wait, what?

332
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,770
Why don't you come?

333
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,898
I mean, I have two tickets. Why not?

334
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:39,445
Well, I don't know, Ross. Really?

335
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,615
Yeah, yeah. It'd be great.
I mean, you can...

336
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,158
You can lay on the beach...

337
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,912
...and I can cry over my failed marriage.

338
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,706
- You see how I make jokes?
- Uh-huh.

339
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,625
Really. I mean...

340
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,044
God, I could use a friend.

341
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,881
Oh, wow. Okay, maybe.

342
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,424
Um...

343
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,635
Yes, I can do that.

344
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,513
- Cool.
- All right, cool.

345
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,600
Okay, we're going to Greece. Yeah, okay.

346
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,769
Aah, aah. I forgot my jacket.

347
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,230
- Well, you tell them to wait.
- Okay.

348
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,482
- Wait. Wait.
- Okay.

349
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,155
Emily.

350
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,161
Oh, no, no, no.

351
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,915
No! No!

352
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,709
Emily!

353
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,506
Ah, yes. I will have a glass
of the Merlot...

354
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,384
...and he will have a white-wine spritzer.

355
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,639
Whoo!

356
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,016
Huh.

357
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,351
Hey, look at that. The airport's moving.

358
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,979
Hey, are we moving?

359
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,315
Are we moving? Why are we moving?

360
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,566
They... Um...

361
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,861
Yeah, does the captain know
that we're moving?

362
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,530
Oh, my gosh.
