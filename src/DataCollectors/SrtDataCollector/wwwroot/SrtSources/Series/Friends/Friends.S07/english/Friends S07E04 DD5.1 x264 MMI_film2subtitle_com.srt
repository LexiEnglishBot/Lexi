1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,143
We learned one thing, Cheese:

2
00:00:04,427 --> 00:00:07,832
Cheerleaders and high explosives
don't mix.

3
00:00:10,376 --> 00:00:12,214
You can say that again, Mac.

4
00:00:12,463 --> 00:00:15,001
I couldn't have done it alone.
You're a genius.

5
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:20,287
Oh, yeah? Well, how come I can't get
my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,673
What did you guys think?

7
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,701
- Hey, the phone.
- I got it. I got it.

8
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,416
Hold on. It's your mom.

9
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:40,534
- It's Mommy.
- That's nice.

10
00:00:40,819 --> 00:00:42,930
Ma. So, what did you think?

11
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,089
Well...

12
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:47,876
...that was okay.

13
00:00:48,195 --> 00:00:49,440
It wasn't the best.

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,156
That was one
of the worst things ever...

15
00:00:53,518 --> 00:00:55,914
...and not just on TV.

16
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,833
- What should we say?
- The lighting was okay.

17
00:00:59,154 --> 00:01:02,179
You got lighting last time.
Lighting is mine.

18
00:01:02,669 --> 00:01:03,677
I have costumes.

19
00:01:03,956 --> 00:01:05,343
That means I'm stuck with:

20
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:10,737
"So we were watching you in there
and you were sitting right here."

21
00:01:11,923 --> 00:01:13,904
- What about you?
- I don't know.

22
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:17,445
I can't lie to him again.
Oh, no, I... No.

23
00:01:17,768 --> 00:01:20,438
I'm just gonna press
my breasts up against him.

24
00:01:21,908 --> 00:01:24,055
- And say nothing?
- Yeah, that's right.

25
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:28,099
My folks really liked it.

26
00:01:28,449 --> 00:01:29,872
What did you guys think?

27
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:38,047
It wasn't that good.

28
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:45,277
The One With Rachel's Assistant

29
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:22,854
Do you think that your favorite animal
says much about you?

30
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:24,874
You mean behind my back?

31
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,681
You'll never believe
what happened to me today.

32
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:32,048
- I am sitting in my office...
- You guys!

33
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:33,951
Guess what my agent just said?

34
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:35,898
I'm in the middle of a story here.

35
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,539
Sorry, you finish.

36
00:02:37,754 --> 00:02:40,636
I'm sitting in my office,
and guess who walks in.

37
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,899
I'm gonna be on two TV shows.

38
00:02:43,216 --> 00:02:44,188
That's great.

39
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,109
- Joey.
- You weren't finished?

40
00:02:47,427 --> 00:02:50,546
Yeah, "Guess who walks
into my office" is my story.

41
00:02:51,636 --> 00:02:53,783
Ralph Lauren walked into my office.

42
00:02:54,072 --> 00:02:57,713
If you're starting another story,
at least let me finish mine.

43
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,471
It's the same story.

44
00:03:01,168 --> 00:03:03,600
It's really long.

45
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:07,976
Ralph just came in to tell me
that he's so happy with my work...

46
00:03:08,302 --> 00:03:12,299
...that he wants me to be the new
merchandising manager for Polo retail.

47
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,594
- Still get a discount on wedding gowns?
- Yeah.

48
00:03:14,877 --> 00:03:16,858
I'm so happy for you.

49
00:03:18,425 --> 00:03:20,643
These really are
the "days of our lives."

50
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:23,956
- What?
- Well, since you ask...

51
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,844
They want me back on
Days of Our Lives.

52
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:28,512
I get a big pay raise!

53
00:03:28,794 --> 00:03:29,862
Oh, hey!

54
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:33,590
I'll be playing Drake Ramoray's
twin brother, Stryker.

55
00:03:34,568 --> 00:03:36,965
I get to hire my own assistant.

56
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:41,282
I got a head rush
from standing up too fast.

57
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,896
You were at this job four years?

58
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:53,594
- That's right.
- This is all very impressive, Hilda.

59
00:03:53,913 --> 00:03:56,095
I just have one last question for you:

60
00:03:57,531 --> 00:03:59,156
How did I do? Was this okay?

61
00:04:00,558 --> 00:04:02,740
- What?
- I've never interviewed anyone.

62
00:04:03,028 --> 00:04:05,104
I've never had anyone work for me.

63
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:08,656
When I was a kid we had a maid,
but this isn't the same.

64
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:11,159
No, dear, it's not.

65
00:04:12,213 --> 00:04:13,672
And I know that.

66
00:04:15,032 --> 00:04:17,084
Well, thank you so much for coming in.

67
00:04:17,398 --> 00:04:19,342
- Nice to meet you.
- Good meeting you.

68
00:04:19,624 --> 00:04:20,940
All right.

69
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,042
I'm a total pro.

70
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,797
Hello.

71
00:04:29,574 --> 00:04:32,315
Hi, yes, I'm sorry.
The models are down the hall.

72
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:34,820
I'm here about the assistant job.

73
00:04:35,176 --> 00:04:36,350
Really?

74
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:41,018
Okay, well, then, all right.
Well, just have a seat there.

75
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,545
So, what's your name?

76
00:04:42,935 --> 00:04:43,871
Tag Jones.

77
00:04:44,221 --> 00:04:45,989
Go on.

78
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,089
That's it. That's my whole name.

79
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,385
That's your whole name.
Of course it is.

80
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,409
Okay, let's just have a look-see here.

81
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:58,300
I haven't worked in an office before.
I don't have much experience...

82
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:02,624
What are you talking about?
You got three years painting houses...

83
00:05:03,287 --> 00:05:06,798
...two whole summers
at TGI Friday's.

84
00:05:07,532 --> 00:05:08,706
It's lame, I know.

85
00:05:09,028 --> 00:05:11,804
But I'm a goal-oriented person,
eager to learn...

86
00:05:12,055 --> 00:05:13,929
Just hold on a second, please.

87
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:22,490
It's for human resources. Everybody
has to. Would you stand up?

88
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:32,022
No, no, no.

89
00:05:43,124 --> 00:05:44,334
Hey.

90
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,880
- Anyway, I should go.
- Okay. Bye.

91
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:53,902
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi, sweetie.

92
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,133
What was with all the whispering?

93
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,639
I can't tell you. It's a secret.

94
00:05:59,094 --> 00:06:02,677
Secret? Married people aren't
supposed to have secrets.

95
00:06:02,955 --> 00:06:05,493
We love and respect
one another too much.

96
00:06:07,548 --> 00:06:08,520
But still, no.

97
00:06:09,426 --> 00:06:13,530
We should tell each other everything.
I don't have secrets from you.

98
00:06:13,775 --> 00:06:18,224
Really? So tell me what happened
to Ross junior year at Disneyland.

99
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:20,202
No, I can't do that.

100
00:06:20,943 --> 00:06:22,995
I'll tell you what Phoebe said.

101
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:24,802
- Okay.
- Okay.

102
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:27,441
So Ross and I
are going to Disneyland.

103
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:29,838
We stop at this restaurant for tacos.

104
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:34,718
When I say "restaurant," I mean a guy,
a hibachi and the trunk of his car.

105
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,358
So Ross has about 10 tacos.

106
00:06:37,677 --> 00:06:42,126
Anyway, we're on Space Mountain
and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.

107
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,973
Oh, my God. He threw up?

108
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:47,622
No, he visited a town
a little south of throw up.

109
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:50,262
- No.
- Yeah.

110
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:53,435
Some of the employees decided
to rename the park...

111
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,520
...the "Crappiest Place on Earth."

112
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:00,769
What was Phoebe's secret?

113
00:07:01,023 --> 00:07:04,985
Nancy Thompson, from Phoebe's
old massage place, is getting fired.

114
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:12,050
That's it? I gave up my
Disneyland story for that?

115
00:07:12,504 --> 00:07:14,971
That's right. You lose, sucker!

116
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:19,114
Please still marry me.

117
00:07:23,116 --> 00:07:24,989
You have an assistant, right?

118
00:07:25,273 --> 00:07:26,281
Did she call?

119
00:07:26,595 --> 00:07:30,344
You told her I was sick, right?
Always tell her I am sick.

120
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,960
No, I just don't know,
how do you decide who to hire?

121
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:35,909
I have it down to two people.

122
00:07:36,232 --> 00:07:39,186
One has great references
and a lot of experience.

123
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:41,863
- And then there's this guy...
- What about him?

124
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,678
I love him.

125
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:48,544
He's so pretty I want to cry.

126
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:50,145
I don't know what to do.

127
00:07:50,392 --> 00:07:53,975
Come on, you know what to do.
You hire the first one.

128
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,846
Don't hire assistants because they're
cute. Do it because they're qualified.

129
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:06,667
I hear you. You make a lot of sense.
Can I just say one more thing?

130
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,127
Look how pretty.

131
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:11,195
Let me see.

132
00:08:12,276 --> 00:08:14,221
Oh, my God.

133
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:16,761
Oh. But no.

134
00:08:17,112 --> 00:08:20,232
No. You can't hire him,
because it's not professional.

135
00:08:22,088 --> 00:08:23,997
This is for me, yes?

136
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,967
Okay, you're right.
I'll hire Hilda tomorrow.

137
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:30,950
Dumb, old, perfect-for-the-job Hilda.

138
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:32,803
Let me see.

139
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:38,992
Don't show this to Monica.

140
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:41,707
And don't tell her about the:

141
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:50,368
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Terry.

142
00:08:50,652 --> 00:08:52,799
- Nice to see you again.
- Been a while.

143
00:08:53,087 --> 00:08:55,862
Funny, these halls look smaller
than they used to.

144
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:58,439
It's a different building.

145
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:00,694
So...

146
00:09:01,228 --> 00:09:03,446
...Stryker Ramoray, huh?

147
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:05,915
- When do I start?
- How about right now?

148
00:09:06,238 --> 00:09:07,591
Okay.

149
00:09:08,222 --> 00:09:10,274
Here are the audition scenes.

150
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:16,464
I thought you
were offering me the part.

151
00:09:16,815 --> 00:09:17,823
Why?

152
00:09:18,137 --> 00:09:21,577
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray,
Stryker's twin brother.

153
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,326
Who looks more like me than me, right?

154
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,634
Everybody has to audition.

155
00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:32,430
You know, Terry,
I don't really need to do this.

156
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:35,277
I got my own cable TV series...

157
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:37,405
...with a robot.

158
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:41,718
I'm sorry, Joey.
That's the way it is.

159
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,875
Well...

160
00:09:44,787 --> 00:09:47,076
...I guess you think
you're pretty special.

161
00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:50,802
Sitting up here in your fancy,
small-halled building...

162
00:09:52,511 --> 00:09:54,871
...making stars jump
through hoops for you.

163
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,614
Well, you know what?

164
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,270
This is one star whose hoop...

165
00:10:01,557 --> 00:10:03,704
This is the star the hoop...
This hoop...

166
00:10:03,992 --> 00:10:05,937
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

167
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,097
Hi, Tag. What are you doing here?

168
00:10:16,413 --> 00:10:19,817
I came to thank you for not laughing
in my face yesterday.

169
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:23,470
I noticed there aren't any plants,
so I brought you your first...

170
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:26,049
There is a plant in your office.

171
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,236
Kind of.

172
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:31,639
- And that was there yesterday, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

173
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,742
I got it the same time I got that one.

174
00:10:35,653 --> 00:10:36,720
Right.

175
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:41,108
So I guess I shouldn't put
"good at noticing stuff" on my résumé.

176
00:10:41,672 --> 00:10:43,581
- Thank you.
- Anyway...

177
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:45,913
...I'm guessing you hired somebody.

178
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:47,751
Well...

179
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:49,387
Gotcha.

180
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,899
Thanks again for meeting with me.

181
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:55,059
But I hired you.

182
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,995
- What?
- Yeah, you got the job.

183
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,258
- You're my new assistant.
- I am?

184
00:11:01,538 --> 00:11:02,961
Yeah.

185
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:07,339
- I can't believe it.
- Me either.

186
00:11:08,392 --> 00:11:11,346
- Rachel, thank you so much.
- Oh, big hug.

187
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:14,268
- Really?
- No, handshake.

188
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:17,367
Okay, let's get started.

189
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,939
First, I need you to go downstairs...

190
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,926
...find a woman named Hilda
and tell her to go home.

191
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:29,927
- Hey.
- Hey, good, you're home.

192
00:11:30,554 --> 00:11:33,436
Always nicer to hear than,
"Oh, crap, you again."

193
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:37,373
Hey, sweetie. I made you a surprise.

194
00:11:37,652 --> 00:11:39,490
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, tacos.

195
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,694
Ever since that story
I've had such a craving for them.

196
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:46,801
Did you not understand the story?

197
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:50,687
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

198
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:54,276
Nothing. Just figuring out
what to do for dinner.

199
00:11:56,995 --> 00:12:00,257
Hey, what's that? Dinner stuff?
You making dinner?

200
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:01,576
No.

201
00:12:05,311 --> 00:12:06,865
What's over there? Tacos?

202
00:12:07,155 --> 00:12:08,708
No. No.

203
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:13,825
They're just... They're
ground beef smileys.

204
00:12:15,923 --> 00:12:17,132
Those are tacos.

205
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:19,886
Excuse me, Mr. Mexico.

206
00:12:20,793 --> 00:12:24,648
Either way, I'll pass.
Still can't eat those.

207
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,555
What's so funny?

208
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:41,031
I'm not laughing.

209
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:51,433
You told her!

210
00:12:52,524 --> 00:12:55,121
Nancy Thompson's getting fired.

211
00:12:58,229 --> 00:13:02,227
Okay, okay. I had food poisoning.
It's not like I chose to do it!

212
00:13:02,543 --> 00:13:06,363
It's not like I said,
"What would make this ride more fun?"

213
00:13:07,415 --> 00:13:11,163
Right. You're right, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be laughing.

214
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,811
I should be
laying down papers for you.

215
00:13:16,877 --> 00:13:19,724
- How could you?
- I had to. We're getting married.

216
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:22,440
Married couples can't keep secrets.

217
00:13:22,688 --> 00:13:25,606
I guess Monica should know
about Atlantic City.

218
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,243
Dude!

219
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:31,415
- What happened?
- Chandler and I are in a bar...

220
00:13:31,664 --> 00:13:34,025
Did you not hear me say, "Dude!"?

221
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:38,161
...and this girl
is making eyes at Chandler.

222
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:43,206
So he goes over to her and after
a minute or two I see them kissing.

223
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:47,902
Now, you're thinking "He's not the type
to go to bars and make out with girls."

224
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:50,170
And you're right.
He's not the type...

225
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:54,545
...to go to bars
and make out with girls.

226
00:13:56,261 --> 00:13:58,206
You kissed a guy?

227
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,643
Oh, my God!

228
00:14:01,898 --> 00:14:06,062
In my defense, it was dark
and he was a very pretty guy.

229
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:09,610
Oh, Mon, I laughed so hard...

230
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:13,513
So hard we had to throw out
your underwear again?

231
00:14:15,954 --> 00:14:18,136
Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy.

232
00:14:23,016 --> 00:14:27,535
Joey, do you think your favorite animal
says a lot about you?

233
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,287
No, because goats can't talk.

234
00:14:32,897 --> 00:14:34,213
- Hi.
- Hey.

235
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:36,193
How's Hilda working out?

236
00:14:36,655 --> 00:14:41,518
Oh, my new assistant
is working out. Yes.

237
00:14:42,118 --> 00:14:43,647
She happy she got the job?

238
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:49,311
My new assistant was very happy
that I hired my new assistant.

239
00:14:51,546 --> 00:14:52,791
Hello.

240
00:14:53,077 --> 00:14:55,365
Oh, hey! Can you hang on a second?

241
00:14:55,617 --> 00:14:59,721
It's the producers at Mac and Cheese,
if you'll excuse me for a minute.

242
00:15:01,531 --> 00:15:05,908
Hey, funny you should call. I was
just looking over next week's script.

243
00:15:07,098 --> 00:15:08,414
Canceled!

244
00:15:09,568 --> 00:15:11,893
Like they're taking it off the air?

245
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:16,382
All right. I'll see you Monday.

246
00:15:17,153 --> 00:15:19,857
We're not even shooting them anymore?

247
00:15:20,248 --> 00:15:22,395
All right. Bye.

248
00:15:23,728 --> 00:15:25,780
They canceled Mac and Cheese!

249
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:27,374
- Sorry.
- Sorry, Joey.

250
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,366
Why would they do that?
It was a good show, right?

251
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:45,191
You want to tell secrets?
Okay. In college...

252
00:15:45,473 --> 00:15:48,462
...Ross used to wear leg warmers.

253
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,963
All right, Chandler entered a
Vanilla Ice look-alike contest and won.

254
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:58,892
Ross came in fourth and cried!

255
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:05,192
- I welled up.
- Oh, my God!

256
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:08,466
Oh, is that funny?
You find that funny?

257
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:11,490
Maybe Chandler should know
your secrets too.

258
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,876
I already told him everything.
You shush!

259
00:16:16,855 --> 00:16:19,108
Once she was sent to bed
without dinner...

260
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,349
...so she ate the macaroni off
a jewelry box she'd made.

261
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:28,822
Ross stayed home every Saturday night
to watch Golden Girls.

262
00:16:31,363 --> 00:16:33,866
Monica couldn't tell time
until she was 13.

263
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,207
It's hard for some people!

264
00:16:39,018 --> 00:16:40,642
Of course it is.

265
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:42,840
Wow.

266
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:46,391
- Chandler wore my underwear to work once!
- Hey!

267
00:16:48,446 --> 00:16:51,222
I'm sorry, I couldn't think
of any more for Ross.

268
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,202
In college, Chandler got drunk...

269
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:56,480
...and slept with the lady
who cleaned our dorm.

270
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:58,770
That was you.

271
00:17:01,736 --> 00:17:04,406
Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy.

272
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:07,717
I can't believe this!

273
00:17:07,964 --> 00:17:10,016
Mac and Cheese was a great show.

274
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:14,361
How about that scene where Mac
teaches Cheese how to yodel? Come on!

275
00:17:15,514 --> 00:17:18,325
Yeah, I actually liked that part.

276
00:17:20,141 --> 00:17:21,730
How could this happen to me?

277
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,706
Yesterday I had two TV shows.
Today I got nothing.

278
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,843
Wait a minute,
what happened to Days of our Lives?

279
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:33,152
Well, they might be a little mad
at me over there.

280
00:17:33,884 --> 00:17:34,820
What happened?

281
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:40,248
Well, maybe I got a little upset, and
maybe I told them where they could go.

282
00:17:40,738 --> 00:17:42,920
Joey, why would you do that?

283
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,640
Because! They wanted me to audition.

284
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:49,291
You? An actor? That's madness!

285
00:17:56,777 --> 00:17:58,615
Rachel Green's office.

286
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,169
Tag.

287
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:03,906
Hi, who was that?

288
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,352
Nobody. I was just practicing.

289
00:18:07,701 --> 00:18:08,840
Really?

290
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:17,333
- Hi.
- Hi, Rachel Green's office.

291
00:18:19,008 --> 00:18:20,668
You must be Hilda.

292
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,344
He's Tag. This is Phoebe.
Phoebe, can I see you for a sec?

293
00:18:26,663 --> 00:18:27,731
Phoebe.

294
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:30,101
- That's a great name.
- Oh, you like that?

295
00:18:30,351 --> 00:18:34,384
- You should hear my phone number.
- Okay. We'll be right back.

296
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:41,376
So you hired yourself
a little treat, did you?

297
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:44,956
I know how it looks,
but I am telling you...

298
00:18:45,276 --> 00:18:47,708
You can't get involved
with your assistant.

299
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:52,676
I know that, and I know hiring him was
not the smartest thing I've ever done.

300
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:56,572
But from now on,
I swear this is strictly professional.

301
00:18:56,897 --> 00:18:58,250
- Yes.
- Hey, Rachel.

302
00:18:58,498 --> 00:18:59,506
Hi.

303
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:02,287
Cute assistant. What's his story?

304
00:19:02,603 --> 00:19:04,785
- Is he...
- Gay? Yeah.

305
00:19:09,874 --> 00:19:12,899
Hey, Terry.

306
00:19:13,215 --> 00:19:14,424
Joey Tribbiani.

307
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:18,316
Surprised your big head
could fit through our small halls.

308
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:21,657
- I gotta go, Joey.
- Wait, Terry! Look.

309
00:19:21,947 --> 00:19:23,821
I'm really sorry about before.

310
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:27,223
I was an idiot, thinking I'm too big
to audition for you.

311
00:19:27,513 --> 00:19:29,696
- Give me another chance.
- I can't.

312
00:19:29,949 --> 00:19:31,752
Wait, Terry, please!

313
00:19:32,732 --> 00:19:34,950
Look, I just lost my other job, okay?

314
00:19:35,272 --> 00:19:38,392
You have no idea how much I need this.

315
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:40,106
Please, help me out.

316
00:19:40,526 --> 00:19:42,435
For old times' sake.

317
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:47,129
This guy's been in a coma
for five years. It's hopeless.

318
00:19:47,414 --> 00:19:50,332
It's not. Dr. Stryker Ramoray
is a miracle worker.

319
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,648
Here he comes.

320
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,951
Good morning.

321
00:20:00,183 --> 00:20:04,739
Drake, it's your brother, Stryker.
Can you hear me?

322
00:20:05,054 --> 00:20:06,998
And cut.

323
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,203
I'm back, baby!

324
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:25,958
You know, in my defense...

325
00:20:26,277 --> 00:20:29,788
...there was no glitter on
the macaroni and very little glue.

326
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,788
And in my defense,
the cleaning lady came on to me.

327
00:20:35,288 --> 00:20:38,242
- Do you have trouble telling time now?
- No.

328
00:20:38,524 --> 00:20:41,157
- Quick, what time is it?
- Time to kiss a guy?

329
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,118
What are you laughing at, Pampers?

330
00:20:50,562 --> 00:20:52,543
You know when I said
married people...

331
00:20:52,892 --> 00:20:55,703
...should share everything
and not have any secrets?

332
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:59,630
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that was stupid. Let's not do that.

333
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:01,344
Absolutely.

334
00:21:01,555 --> 00:21:05,268
- I'm on board.
- Thank you. Thank you.

335
00:21:06,322 --> 00:21:10,356
We should keep the stuff we told
each other secret from everyone else.

336
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,474
Yeah, definitely.

337
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:15,850
Okay. If you'll excuse me...

338
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:20,237
...I'm gonna hang out with people who
don't know the Space Mountain story.

339
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:24,790
- Then I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
- Man!

340
00:21:26,362 --> 00:21:30,810
Not that you would, but I wouldn't
hang out with the guys at my office.

341
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:41,809
Hi.

342
00:21:44,176 --> 00:21:46,607
- Do you have a minute?
- Sure. What's up?

343
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:50,676
I got asked out twice today
while I was at lunch...

344
00:21:50,995 --> 00:21:52,655
...by guys.

345
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:56,132
- Really?
- Yeah.

346
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:58,777
Did you tell someone that I was gay?

347
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:02,400
Oh, did you not want people
to know that?

348
00:22:03,763 --> 00:22:08,449
I'm not gay. I especially wouldn't
want you to think I was gay.

349
00:22:08,982 --> 00:22:10,511
Why is that?

350
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:15,936
- I don't think I should say.
- Oh, you can say.

351
00:22:17,749 --> 00:22:21,390
Come on, I don't want you to feel
like you can't tell me things.

352
00:22:24,151 --> 00:22:25,254
- Okay.
- Okay.

353
00:22:26,308 --> 00:22:28,111
- Well...
- Yeah.

354
00:22:28,535 --> 00:22:30,860
I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe.

355
00:22:33,997 --> 00:22:35,694
Yeah, she's gay.
