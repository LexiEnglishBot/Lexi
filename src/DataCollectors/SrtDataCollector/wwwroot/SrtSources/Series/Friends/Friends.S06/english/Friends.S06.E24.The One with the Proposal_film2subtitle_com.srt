The Mr. Bowmont's here!

331
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,528
A customer wants to compliment you.
Shall I let him in?

332
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,073
Sure! I love this part!

333
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,159
- Come on in.
- Hi.

334
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,161
Richard.

335
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,747
I'm not here to compliment the chef.

336
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,459
Oh. I hate when people come back
to compliment the chef.

337
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,045
Like I've nothing better to do.

338
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,506
What's up?

339
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,384
It was great seeing you
the other night.

340
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,469
Good to see you too.

341
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,764
Come down here
to tell me that?

342
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,434
No. Came here to tell you
something else.

343
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,481
Came here to tell you
I still love you.
