1
00:00:05,249 --> 00:00:07,609
- I'm ready.
- You sure?

2
00:00:07,963 --> 00:00:10,560
Let me just straighten out
your helmet there.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,456
- Thanks, Daddy.
- No, no. One daddy, two mommies.

4
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:19,091
- All right, it's all yours.
- Okay, okay.

5
00:00:19,409 --> 00:00:21,105
There you go, there you go.

6
00:00:21,392 --> 00:00:25,282
Wow, Ben's first big-kid's bike.
This is so exciting!

7
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,441
Oh, yeah, I remember mine.

8
00:00:27,724 --> 00:00:30,156
It was my sixth birthday.
I went to the park...

9
00:00:30,438 --> 00:00:33,843
...and I got on it, and it bent.
- Yeah.

10
00:00:34,996 --> 00:00:37,569
- I never had a bike of my own.
- What?

11
00:00:37,849 --> 00:00:39,545
We didn't have a lot of money.

12
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:42,501
But the girl across the street
had the best bike.

13
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:47,167
It was pink, and it had rainbow-colored
tassels hanging off the handles...

14
00:00:47,486 --> 00:00:50,403
...and a bell
and this big, white wicker basket...

15
00:00:50,687 --> 00:00:53,604
...with those
plastic daisies stuck on.

16
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,384
That sounds like my first bike.

17
00:00:57,889 --> 00:00:59,621
My dad gave me his old one.

18
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,958
- Did the girl ever let you ride it?
- No.

19
00:01:03,212 --> 00:01:05,572
But she gave me the box
that it came in.

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,196
It had a picture of the bike
on the front.

21
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:13,711
So I would sit on it, and my stepdad
would drag me around the backyard.

22
00:01:14,589 --> 00:01:16,118
That is so unfair.

23
00:01:16,538 --> 00:01:19,384
Not really, I got
to drag him around too.

24
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:24,599
The One With All the Candy

25
00:02:03,054 --> 00:02:04,786
Hey, what are you guys doing?

26
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:07,088
Making candy for the neighbors.

27
00:02:07,612 --> 00:02:08,583
I'm sorry, who?

28
00:02:10,186 --> 00:02:12,238
I'm gonna hang
a basket on the door.

29
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:15,400
When the neighbors walk by,
they can take a piece.

30
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:19,333
- But we don't know the neighbors.
- I do.

31
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,497
There's, let's see,
the guy with the mustache...

32
00:02:22,745 --> 00:02:26,007
...smokes-a-lot lady,
some kids I've seen...

33
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:30,291
...and a red-haired guy
who does not like to be called Rusty.

34
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:34,044
Oh, I know that guy.
He also doesn't like it when you say:

35
00:02:34,262 --> 00:02:36,409
"Back off, Howdy Doody. I'm engaged."

36
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,437
You got hit on by Firebeard?

37
00:02:40,698 --> 00:02:43,331
See, this is exactly why
I'm making this candy.

38
00:02:43,586 --> 00:02:45,531
We can get to know our neighbors.

39
00:02:45,743 --> 00:02:48,069
Wouldn't it be easier
if we just moved?

40
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,899
Good morning!

41
00:02:53,223 --> 00:02:56,556
- Somebody's in a good mood.
- Well, why shouldn't I be?

42
00:02:56,806 --> 00:02:59,724
I have great friends.
I have a wonderful job...

43
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:02,962
Where you can make out
with your assistant.

44
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:04,382
It's not a big deal.

45
00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:08,597
We stayed up all night creating a plan
so that us dating won't be a problem.

46
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:10,574
Oh, yeah? What's the plan?

47
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:17,254
We... We are not...

48
00:03:18,308 --> 00:03:20,182
...going to let it...

49
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,055
...be a problem.

50
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,100
It took you all night
to come up with that plan?

51
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,811
Well, you know,
we did other stuff too.

52
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,213
Did you two...?

53
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:33,997
Oh, I don't sleep with guys
on the first date.

54
00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:36,875
- Matt Wire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wise...
- Anymore!

55
00:03:43,845 --> 00:03:47,107
Hi, Tag, I have a conference call
today, is that correct?

56
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,383
- Yes, at 4.
- Okay, thank you, that'll be all.

57
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:53,096
Wait, wait.

58
00:03:56,753 --> 00:03:59,184
Did you see that?
He had no idea...

59
00:03:59,397 --> 00:04:01,864
...there was something
going on between us.

60
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:12,265
- I'd better get back to my desk.
- Okay, hard worker.

61
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:16,304
I'll put that in your evaluation.

62
00:04:16,654 --> 00:04:19,394
- My what?
- You've been here for two months now.

63
00:04:19,681 --> 00:04:23,264
And your boss is required to hand in
a performance evaluation.

64
00:04:23,508 --> 00:04:27,327
But you know, there is one thing
that I have yet to evaluate.

65
00:04:34,398 --> 00:04:38,360
- Are you serious?
- No, I've just always wanted to do that.

66
00:04:39,094 --> 00:04:40,932
Can you help me clean this up?

67
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:48,549
- I'm excited to see if anyone ate my candy.
- Me too!

68
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:50,842
- You don't have to do that.
- Thanks.

69
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:55,228
The basket is totally empty!
The neighbors ate it all!

70
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:56,870
Well, either that or...

71
00:04:57,116 --> 00:05:00,663
No. Not even Joey could eat that much.

72
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:03,579
Little refresher, popcorn shrimp night.

73
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:05,639
Joey!

74
00:05:07,936 --> 00:05:08,873
Yeah?

75
00:05:09,154 --> 00:05:12,215
- Did you eat all the neighbor candy?
- That was the plan.

76
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,756
When I got to it,
there was only a few pieces left.

77
00:05:16,008 --> 00:05:18,084
They've come by all day.
They love it.

78
00:05:18,826 --> 00:05:20,938
They love my candy?

79
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:24,146
- Oh, man, I gotta go make more.
- Hey, Mon.

80
00:05:24,428 --> 00:05:29,328
Make some more lasagna too. Something
might have happened to a chunk of it.

81
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:32,387
Ross, the neighbors ate all my candy.

82
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,169
Mine stole my newspaper.

83
00:05:34,448 --> 00:05:35,943
It's like a crime wave.

84
00:05:40,188 --> 00:05:42,335
Pheebs, you got a second?

85
00:05:42,624 --> 00:05:43,692
Sure.

86
00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:46,864
Ever since you told me
about that bike...

87
00:05:47,182 --> 00:05:49,293
...I couldn't stop thinking about it.

88
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:53,188
I mean, everyone should have
a first bike, you know? So...

89
00:05:57,097 --> 00:05:59,873
Oh, my God, Ross!

90
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:02,031
- You like it?
- I love it!

91
00:06:02,351 --> 00:06:04,534
- Yeah?
- Oh, oh, God...

92
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:06,767
And I love you.

93
00:06:07,222 --> 00:06:08,645
Not that way.

94
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:11,559
But the bike got you a lot closer.

95
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:13,893
Well, take it downstairs.

96
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,052
You know, give it a test drive.

97
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:18,379
Okay. Oh, my God.

98
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,785
My first bike!

99
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:24,128
Thank you for the best present
I've ever gotten.

100
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,215
You're welcome.

101
00:06:28,549 --> 00:06:30,661
Oh, and Chandler's about to cry.

102
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:34,001
Am not.

103
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,495
Hey, dude, it's okay. It kind of...

104
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,926
...got to me a little too.

105
00:06:41,144 --> 00:06:43,576
I'm just so glad I
could make her happy.

106
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:46,143
Thanks. I'm glad I'm not alone on this.

107
00:06:46,397 --> 00:06:48,509
- Yeah, you are.
- Yeah, you are.

108
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,728
Who is that?

109
00:06:54,608 --> 00:06:56,066
Don't worry, I'm brave.

110
00:06:56,312 --> 00:06:58,638
I... I am brave.

111
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,939
No, no, no, no!

112
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:05,488
Can you tell me who is there, please?

113
00:07:06,646 --> 00:07:09,243
My name's Gary. I live upstairs.

114
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:12,901
- Hi.
- Hi.

115
00:07:13,152 --> 00:07:16,307
- Do you know what time it is?
- It's candy time.

116
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:20,110
My roommate says they taste
like little drops of heaven.

117
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:22,227
Oh, please.

118
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:25,391
Did you hear that?
"Little drops of heaven."

119
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:28,492
Four a. M.

120
00:07:28,843 --> 00:07:30,954
So can I get some candy?

121
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,442
I am sorry, but some of us
have to get up early and go to work.

122
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:39,201
He does not know
that I am not "some of us."

123
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:42,717
- He can hear me, can't he?
- Yeah.

124
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:46,479
I'm sorry, but I'll put some out
in the morning.

125
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:49,015
Okay, I'll swing by later.

126
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,103
You live in this building?

127
00:07:52,397 --> 00:07:54,199
Seems like I'd remember you.

128
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,315
Night, Gar.

129
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:05,438
Is there anybody in this building
that does not hit on you?

130
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:07,870
Smokes-a-lot lady.

131
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,658
Oh, wait, that is not true.

132
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:25,023
So did you read your evaluation yet?

133
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:27,601
No, it was marked "confidential."

134
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,829
I just sent it to human resources.

135
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:37,132
Please, you're kidding, right?
I wrote that one as a joke for you.

136
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:39,256
A joke they would appreciate?

137
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:41,831
I'm thinking, no.

138
00:08:42,532 --> 00:08:46,909
- What did you say?
- I said you were a good kisser...

139
00:08:47,124 --> 00:08:51,431
...and that I liked your
teeny, tiny tushy.

140
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:54,594
No, not my tushy.

141
00:08:54,849 --> 00:08:55,916
It gets worse.

142
00:08:56,205 --> 00:08:58,257
About your initiative, I wrote:

143
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,797
"He was able to unhook my bra
with minimal supervision."

144
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:07,682
Under problems with performance,
I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not."

145
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:12,381
And then... And then I drew
a little smiley face.

146
00:09:12,592 --> 00:09:15,783
And then a small pornographic sketch.

147
00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:27,895
That is so sweet of you
to get Phoebe that bike.

148
00:09:28,144 --> 00:09:30,398
When I heard the story,
I almost cried.

149
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:32,178
Almost cried, huh?

150
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:34,746
Hear that, Chandler? "Almost" cried.

151
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,267
Hey, you cry every time
somebody talks about Titanic.

152
00:09:39,694 --> 00:09:42,055
Those two had only each other.

153
00:09:43,348 --> 00:09:44,700
She really likes it, huh?

154
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:47,486
Oh, yeah. I saw her
walking it down the street.

155
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:50,756
She had these flowers in the basket.
It was so cute.

156
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:53,812
I saw her this morning,
walking it by the park.

157
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,741
Wait, she was walking the bike?

158
00:09:56,986 --> 00:09:58,610
Both times?

159
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:02,091
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Oh, hi!

160
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:06,127
- Hey, so you enjoying the bike?
- Oh, so much.

161
00:10:06,902 --> 00:10:11,908
Pheebs, you do know how
to ride a bike, don't you?

162
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,285
Of course.

163
00:10:17,061 --> 00:10:18,484
Can we see you ride it?

164
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,294
Okay.

165
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:36,262
See?

166
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:45,164
I told you not to get
involved with your assistant.

167
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,750
There's no such thing as a secret
when it comes to affairs.

168
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:51,712
Did you hear that, Chandler?

169
00:10:51,957 --> 00:10:53,866
No such thing.

170
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,279
What happened? I'm just eating candy.

171
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:03,917
Maybe it's not that bad. They might
not take it the way I meant it.

172
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:07,845
Absolutely, you know?
Because "tushy" can mean both ass...

173
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,629
...and good worker.

174
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,527
I just gotta get the thing back.

175
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:15,821
Rach? That sketch you mentioned?

176
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:18,570
Might it have looked
a little like this?

177
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:20,791
Oh, my God, Joey!

178
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:24,969
- What is the matter with you?
- God!

179
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,572
This little talent came in handy
before I could afford porn.

180
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:40,242
Hi, I'm sorry. I know it's
after-hours, but I really need candy.

181
00:11:40,595 --> 00:11:43,620
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
See? Rules are rules.

182
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:46,820
Please, I have people coming
from out of town today.

183
00:11:47,102 --> 00:11:49,913
- I told them all about your candy.
- You're kidding.

184
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:53,116
Out-of-towners, huh?
What did you tell them?

185
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,732
I told them your candy
was absolutely indescribable.

186
00:11:57,052 --> 00:12:01,952
Some people have said it's "little
drops of heaven. " But whatever.

187
00:12:02,654 --> 00:12:06,544
- Please, can't you help me out?
- Hey, Chandler, do we know that lady?

188
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:10,827
Isn't she the woman who lives
below you and has sex really loud?

189
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:13,255
All right, I'll do it just this once.

190
00:12:13,578 --> 00:12:16,804
- But you can't tell anyone.
- Please, just give it to me.

191
00:12:17,058 --> 00:12:19,169
Yeah, that's her.

192
00:12:20,085 --> 00:12:22,029
- Thank you.
- Unbelievable!

193
00:12:22,311 --> 00:12:24,707
I can't believe that sign didn't work.

194
00:12:24,921 --> 00:12:27,838
You know what would work?
Stop making candy.

195
00:12:28,818 --> 00:12:30,098
But they like it.

196
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:32,363
You mean they like you.

197
00:12:33,722 --> 00:12:34,731
Maybe.

198
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,306
Is that why you became a chef,
so people would like you?

199
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:42,592
You want to talk about getting
people to like you, huh, funny man?

200
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:55,561
Just remember everything
I taught you, and you'll be fine.

201
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:57,547
Okay? Here we go.

202
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,672
Ready, set...

203
00:12:59,886 --> 00:13:02,662
Wait, this seat
is really uncomfortable.

204
00:13:03,017 --> 00:13:06,042
Maybe before we start
we should just get another one.

205
00:13:06,357 --> 00:13:09,691
Perhaps like an airplane seat,
or a beanbag chair!

206
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:14,776
You can't get out of this.
You have to learn how to ride a bike.

207
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:17,903
Why? Why do I have to learn?

208
00:13:18,952 --> 00:13:23,329
- Well, in case of an emergency.
- What kind of emergency?

209
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,992
Well, what if a man comes along
and puts a gun to your head and says:

210
00:13:28,276 --> 00:13:30,873
"You ride this bike or I'll...

211
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,629
I'll shoot you."

212
00:13:34,086 --> 00:13:36,375
I would ring the bell to distract him.

213
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:40,172
Then I would knock the gun away
with a Chinese throwing star.

214
00:13:41,392 --> 00:13:44,583
Okay, Phoebe, just get on the bike...

215
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,656
...and, hey, I'll hold you up
and push you. Okay?

216
00:13:49,986 --> 00:13:51,540
You won't let go?

217
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:53,041
- No.
- You swear?

218
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,536
I swear.

219
00:13:56,423 --> 00:13:58,190
- Okay.
- Come on.

220
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,787
All right, here we go. All right?

221
00:14:03,068 --> 00:14:04,040
- All right.
- All right?

222
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,265
Feel good?
All right, try pedaling.

223
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,632
That's it, you're doing great.
Yes, take control.

224
00:14:09,887 --> 00:14:12,070
Yes, yes, yes!

225
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,318
Oh, no!

226
00:14:18,098 --> 00:14:19,378
You swore!

227
00:14:19,628 --> 00:14:24,279
- I just thought you were doing so well.
- I am shocked. Shocked!

228
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:31,420
It's a legitimate learning technique.

229
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:33,922
Wow.

230
00:14:41,721 --> 00:14:46,798
Hey, there's some people outside
asking about candy.

231
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:50,447
They'll just have to wait, won't they?
I only got two hands!

232
00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:54,001
- Need some help?
- No, you don't know the system.

233
00:14:54,246 --> 00:14:56,713
I don't need nobody messing
with the system!

234
00:14:57,586 --> 00:15:01,619
By the way, the week before your
wedding, you may not see a lot of me.

235
00:15:12,234 --> 00:15:14,037
Oh, hello, liar.

236
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:20,296
Look, I'm really sorry
I let go of the bike.

237
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,563
I could've been killed, you know.

238
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:26,352
I know, I know.

239
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:30,212
But can we please try it again?

240
00:15:30,534 --> 00:15:32,823
I mean, you were so close, Phoebe.

241
00:15:33,073 --> 00:15:35,576
Well, I would love to...

242
00:15:36,414 --> 00:15:39,640
...but the bike got stolen
and the police have no suspects.

243
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:47,400
- Phoebe.
- What?

244
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,307
What the hell?

245
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,911
You know what?

246
00:15:55,132 --> 00:15:58,192
If you won't learn how to ride,
then I'm sorry...

247
00:15:58,437 --> 00:16:00,418
...I have to take it back.
- What? Why?

248
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:03,998
Because it's...

249
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:08,276
It'd be like you having this guitar...

250
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:10,259
...and never playing it.

251
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,391
Okay, this guitar wants to be played.

252
00:16:13,711 --> 00:16:16,771
And this bike wants to be ridden.

253
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:19,303
And if you don't ride it...

254
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:23,623
...you're killing its spirit.

255
00:16:25,157 --> 00:16:26,960
The bike...

256
00:16:27,941 --> 00:16:29,565
...is dying.

257
00:16:33,611 --> 00:16:38,059
All right. If you care enough
to make up that load of crap, okay.

258
00:16:38,483 --> 00:16:39,977
Great, great.

259
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:44,430
You're making the bike very happy.

260
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:45,920
Okay, Ross.

261
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,723
Please don't die!

262
00:16:54,452 --> 00:16:56,848
To get the evaluation
before they see it...

263
00:16:57,096 --> 00:17:01,615
...we gotta get into Zelner's office.
He doesn't get in until 10.

264
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:05,860
But his assistant, Betty, comes in
early to eat breakfast at her desk.

265
00:17:06,073 --> 00:17:09,299
- That's kind of sad.
- Yeah, well, Betty's kind of sad.

266
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,473
Which is why I believe I can lure
her away with these chocolates.

267
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:17,136
While I distract her, you go in.

268
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,732
- Got it.
- Let's roll.

269
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:22,518
Hello, Rachel. You got a minute?

270
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:26,141
Yeah, sure, Mr. Zelner.
For you? Anything. Minute.

271
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:28,158
Okay, great.

272
00:17:28,443 --> 00:17:29,997
Abort the plan.

273
00:17:30,844 --> 00:17:33,442
Actually, I'd like to speak
to both of you.

274
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,114
Okay.

275
00:17:36,236 --> 00:17:40,649
Well, can we get you anything,
Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates.

276
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:44,961
No, thanks,
but I'll give these to Betty.

277
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:49,657
So I read your evaluation of Tag.

278
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:53,277
Or to use his full name,
Tag "Sweet Cheeks" Jones?

279
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:57,239
Is something going on with you two?

280
00:17:58,886 --> 00:18:02,990
Oh, my God,
can you imagine if there was?

281
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:08,276
I mean, what would happen exactly?

282
00:18:09,497 --> 00:18:11,929
Well, I'd be forced to file a report.

283
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:14,844
I'd have to consult
with the legal department.

284
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:18,324
And your future at the company
would be in jeopardy.

285
00:18:19,518 --> 00:18:21,048
- Well...
- Mr. Zelner...

286
00:18:21,814 --> 00:18:23,925
I filled in that evaluation.

287
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,460
- Oh, no...
- Yeah, yeah.

288
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,725
I thought it would be funny.

289
00:18:29,016 --> 00:18:31,862
You wrote that you have a cute tushy?

290
00:18:33,504 --> 00:18:37,109
Yes. I have a weird sense of humor.

291
00:18:37,435 --> 00:18:39,902
And I'm kind of strangely
proud of my butt.

292
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:43,549
It's kind of a risky joke, Tag.

293
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,889
What is this drawing?
I can't figure it out.

294
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:50,404
It's upside down, you gotta...
It doesn't matter.

295
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,306
It's not like I don't have
a sense of humor.

296
00:18:54,587 --> 00:18:58,098
Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick
every now and then.

297
00:19:00,815 --> 00:19:02,369
There's a time and a place.

298
00:19:04,503 --> 00:19:07,136
Unless you have a limerick right now.

299
00:19:09,826 --> 00:19:13,504
No? Okay.
Well, you've got my fax number.

300
00:19:21,586 --> 00:19:24,124
I can't believe you did that.
That was sweet.

301
00:19:24,335 --> 00:19:27,075
- Don't worry about it.
- You could've lost your job.

302
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,625
Are you kidding me? With this
cute butt, I'd find work.

303
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:34,803
Thank you, you're great.

304
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:38,838
- You know what?
- What?

305
00:19:39,156 --> 00:19:40,888
I feel great.

306
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,394
In fact...

307
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,834
What?

308
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:53,830
It's just... It took me so long
to get that desk organized.

309
00:19:54,185 --> 00:19:55,917
I'm sorry.

310
00:19:57,142 --> 00:19:59,052
There it is.

311
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,128
What is going on?

312
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,750
We're waiting for the candy.
Bring out the candy!

313
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,291
Yeah, lady, give us candy!

314
00:20:19,966 --> 00:20:20,903
Joey!

315
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,957
- What's up, buddy?
- What are you doing?

316
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:27,272
Waiting to get candy.

317
00:20:27,968 --> 00:20:29,593
Get in here.

318
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:33,182
Hey, and you cannot smoke in here.

319
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:38,017
Merry Christmas.

320
00:20:39,345 --> 00:20:43,473
The candy is coming! I need
another 15 minutes for it to cool.

321
00:20:45,086 --> 00:20:49,677
All right, everybody, just be quiet.
Be quiet! Be quiet! Pipe down!

322
00:20:49,922 --> 00:20:52,034
What is the matter with you people?

323
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:57,045
This woman was trying to do a nice
thing for you, and look at her.

324
00:20:58,655 --> 00:21:00,944
She is a mess.

325
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,077
Her hair's not brushed. She's
got dark circles under her eyes...

326
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:08,359
...chocolate on her face,
and she is still stunning.

327
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:14,653
She was making candy
so she could get to know all of you.

328
00:21:14,937 --> 00:21:18,341
And I'll bet that not one of you
can tell me her name.

329
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,048
Am I right?

330
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:22,621
Candy Lady?

331
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:26,273
No, not "Candy Lady."

332
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:29,509
If we know it, can we have candy?

333
00:21:30,697 --> 00:21:32,394
All right, you know what?

334
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,149
Forget it, you've ruined it.

335
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:37,410
Go home. You've ruined it.

336
00:21:37,726 --> 00:21:41,404
That's all wrong! You guys
ruined everything. You ruined it!

337
00:21:48,128 --> 00:21:50,595
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

338
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:53,753
Did you smoke?

339
00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:59,881
No, smokes-a-lot lady blew smoke
directly into my mouth.

340
00:22:00,897 --> 00:22:02,321
Are you okay?

341
00:22:02,532 --> 00:22:05,106
Fine, but it was
really scary for a while.

342
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:08,411
Someone slipped a threatening
note under the door!

343
00:22:08,655 --> 00:22:12,545
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.
Mob mentality or whatever.

344
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:25,458
I can't believe it. I did it.
I rode a bike!

345
00:22:25,739 --> 00:22:28,835
I never thought I'd be able
to do that. Thank you.

346
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:31,367
Oh, hey, don't thank me.
Thank yourself.

347
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:35,402
You're the one who faced your fears
and ultimately overcame them.

348
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:39,509
Don't be so corny, Ross.
It's not an After School Special.
