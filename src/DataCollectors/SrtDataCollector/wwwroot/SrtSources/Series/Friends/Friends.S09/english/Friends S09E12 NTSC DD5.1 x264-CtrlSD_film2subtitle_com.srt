1
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:06,663
-Where's Mon?
-She's at home...

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,707
...putting up decorations
for Rachel's birthday party tonight.

3
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:12,070
-You're not helping?
-l tried...

4
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:16,147
...but apparently singing ''l Will Survive''
in a helium voice, not helping.

5
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,610
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

6
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,917
Don't say that loud.
Gunther's gonna want to hug me.

7
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:30,789
Good news, everyone.
We finally found a nanny.

8
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:35,958
-This is Molly. Molly, Chandler, Joey.
-Hi.

9
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,604
Somebody's getting a little fussy.

10
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:42,241
You're damn right l am. l've been
waiting for a cookie for seven minutes.

11
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,775
Okay. You know what,
l'm just gonna take her outside.

12
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,277
-No, you stay. l'll do it.
-Okay. Thank you.

13
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:51,849
-Nice to meet you guys.
-Yeah, you too.

14
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,680
-Wow, Molly's just great.
-Yeah.

15
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,880
Yes, bravo on the hot nanny.

16
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,384
-What? You really think she's hot?
-Are you kidding?

17
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,894
lf l wasn't married,
she'd be rejecting me right now.

18
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,327
Joey?

19
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,332
How do you think she's doing?

20
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:14,973
Am l the only one that doesn't think
she's hot? Ross?

21
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,743
-l mean, she's not unattractive, but...
-Right.

22
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,347
...but hot?

23
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,579
Thank you.

24
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,150
Now that Rachel's gone?

25
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:30,879
So hot, l cried myself to sleep
last night.

26
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,135
Hey, Mike,
what's the capital of Peru?

27
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,939
-Lima.
-No.

28
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,918
lt starts with a V
and ends with an X.

29
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,954
And hopefully with a T-O
in the middle.

30
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,857
You know, come to think of it,
the capital of Peru is ''Vtox.''

31
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,560
-Oh, God!
-What?

32
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,995
Okay. l don't want to freak you out
or anything...

33
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,067
...but l just saw a rat
in your cupboard.

34
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,737
Oh, yeah. No, that's Bob.

35
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,404
Well, he's your pet rat?

36
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:58,236
Well, not so much a pet as, you know,
an occasional visitor...

37
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:03,872
...who l put food out for.
Kind of like Santa.

38
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:08,314
Except Santa doesn't poop
on the plate of cookies.

39
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,590
You can't keep a rat in your apartment.
They're unsanitary.

40
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,750
l mean, they transmit leptospirosis
and hantavirus.

41
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,485
-What are those?
-l don't know...

42
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,131
...but they don't sound
like spa treatments.

43
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,824
-You have to get rid of it.
-Okay, fine.

44
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,299
lf it means that much to you,
l'll get rid of Bob.

45
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,165
Thank you.

46
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:30,105
lt's so weird you think he's so gross,
yet you're willing to eat his crackers.

47
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,515
-Hello.
-Hello.

48
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,416
Gavin, l just want to say
thank you again...

49
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,614
...for watching Emma yesterday
during the presentation.

50
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,657
l really owe you an apology.

51
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,691
-For what?
-When we first met, you know...

52
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:54,355
...l thought you were pompous
and arrogant and obnoxious.

53
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,228
ls this your first apology?

54
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,668
No, l just mean, you know,
first impressions don't mean anything.

55
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,743
And l think you're a really good guy.
And l'm sorry that l misjudged you.

56
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,311
-Morning.
-Hello.

57
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:11,644
But you know what?
Hey, new day, new leaf.

58
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:15,720
l am just really, really happy--

59
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,749
l'm sorry. Obviously, Heather's ass
has something more important to say...

60
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,723
...so l'll just wait till it's finished.

61
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,164
-What?
-l was giving you an apology...

62
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,322
...and you were totally
checking her out.

63
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:31,492
l wasn't. l'm in fashion.
l was looking at her skirt.

64
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:36,608
Or was it pants? l didn't really see
what happened below the ass area.

65
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,735
Wow, you are really....
You're really a creep.

66
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,039
What do you care
if l was looking at her?

67
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,546
Are you jealous?

68
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,411
Oh, yeah. l'm jealous.

69
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,918
''Oh, Gavin. Please,
please look at my ass.''

70
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,714
Stop looking at my ass!

71
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,622
l mean, l just think
you are totally inappropriate. Okay?

72
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:59,196
This is a work environment.
She's your subordinate.

73
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,891
But it was okay when you
slept with your old assistant, Tag?

74
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,300
That is totally different
for two reasons.

75
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,942
One: l didn't know
that you knew that.

76
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,873
And two: l wasn't some creep
staring at his ass.

77
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:19,508
We had a.... We had a deep,
meaningful relationship.

78
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,016
What was Tag's last name?

79
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,917
lt was....

80
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,591
Oh, my God.

81
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:32,288
He didn't-- He didn't--
He didn't have a last name.

82
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:38,131
lt was just Tag, you know,
like Cher or...

83
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,972
...you know, Moses.

84
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,842
But it was a deep,
meaningful relationship.

85
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:48,070
You know what? My first impression
of you was absolutely right.

86
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,011
You are arrogant. You are pompous.
Morgan! Morgan!

87
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,982
-Tag's last name was Morgan!
-lt was Jones.

88
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,812
What are you, his boyfriend?

89
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:04,829
-Man, l wish l had a nanny like you.
-You mean when you were a baby?

90
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,462
Sure.

91
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,463
Would you stop staring at her?

92
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,169
l wasn't staring.

93
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,774
l was leering.

94
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,175
What's the big deal with her?

95
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,439
Maybe she's attractive
in an obvious kind of way.

96
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:25,947
Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst.

97
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,713
You know, when it's right there
in your face.

98
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,686
Me, l like to have to work
to find someone attractive.

99
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,689
Makes me feel like l earned it.

100
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,988
Looks like Joey's doing all right
with her.

101
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,627
Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys
to back off...

102
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,893
...and let Joey get the girl for once.

103
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:47,695
-l'm gonna take her to the apartment.
-Okay. l'll be home right after work.

104
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,465
-Okay.
-Okay, bye, Emma.

105
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,839
l love you.

106
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,578
-Bye.
-Bye.

107
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,216
They've elected me to talk to you
about the baby talk.

108
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,750
lt's not so good.

109
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,181
l think it's sweet.

110
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,516
Bye, Emma!

111
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,354
Hey, listen, Joey. About Molly, l would
really prefer if you didn't go after her.

112
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,591
-Why not?
-lt took months to find a good nanny.

113
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:19,636
And l wouldn't want anything to,
you know, drive her away.

114
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,864
So you think l'm just
gonna sleep with her...

115
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,340
...and never call her again, and
things are gonna get uncomfortable?

116
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,638
Yeah, that sounds about right.

117
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,846
Come on, there are plenty
of other women out there.

118
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:35,954
Just forget about her, okay?
She's off-limits.

119
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,283
Oh, man! What'd you have to go
and say that for?

120
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,190
Now that you told me l can't have her,
makes me want her even more!

121
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,591
-What are you, a child?
-Yes!

122
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,260
lt's true.
He's like a little boy, like Ben.

123
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:54,896
Just think of him
as a really, really, really horny Ben.

124
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,035
No!

125
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,704
Look, Joey, come on now.
For me, please.

126
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:07,785
Just try to focus your sexual energy
on someone else.

127
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,415
Fine.

128
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:18,891
Take me home.

129
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,805
Do you want a piece of this?

130
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,048
-Hey, Mikey.
-Hey, Pheeb.

131
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,685
-What are you doing?
-Setting rattraps.

132
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:45,449
-To kill Bob?
-No. No, to test his neck strength.

133
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,922
No, l don't want to kill him.
l thought we were gonna capture him...

134
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,723
...and, you know, set him free
in the countryside...

135
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,798
...where he could meet
a friendly possum...

136
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,901
...and a wisecracking owl.

137
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,934
-Okay, okay. l'll throw away the traps.
-All right, l'll find Bob. l'll get him.

138
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:05,237
Bob? Bob?

139
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,811
Robert?

140
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,280
Wait, l think l hear him.

141
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:18,120
Oh, my God! Bob had babies!
Bob's a mom!

142
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,883
We'll have to think of a new name.

143
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,493
l don't know,
l kind of like ''Bob'' for a girl.

144
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,994
No, no. l mean, l'm not sure that we--

145
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,502
Oh, my God. We killed Bob?

146
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,332
Well, maybe it wasn't Bob.
Maybe it was a mouse.

147
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,907
Susie?

148
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,976
That's it?

149
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,015
lt's over?

150
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,948
Who shot J.R.?

151
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,081
Who shot J.R.?

152
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,153
l have got to get a job.

153
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,587
What's up?

154
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,926
Seriously, dude. Three years ago.

155
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,704
Listen, can you do me a favor?
l'm gonna be out today.

156
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,237
Can you keep an eye on Joey...

157
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,001
...make sure nothing happens
between him and Molly?

158
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,337
-You don't trust him?
-Well, no.

159
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,242
Some woman who sounded
a lot like Joey called earlier...

160
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:20,317
...and asked for her daughter,
the ''hot nanny.''

161
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,749
ls this your long-term plan,
for me to run interference?

162
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:27,586
Because l could get a job any day now.

163
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,355
You do appear right on the cusp
of something.

164
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,829
Look, come on, man. l'm sure
he'll lose interest in a week or two...

165
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,469
...but for now, could you please
just do this for me?

166
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,568
Fine, but don't blame me
if it doesn't work.

167
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,333
Because you know once Joey
sets his mind on something...

168
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:45,966
...more often than not,
he's going to have sex with it.

169
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,109
Well, l mean,
we've gotta do something. Okay?

170
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:54,116
Nannies like her don't grow on trees.

171
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,650
-Picturing that tree?
-l am, yes.

172
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,495
Where you going, Joe?

173
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,635
For a walk.

174
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,774
You mind if l join you?

175
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:22,308
Actually, l'd rather be alone. You know,
l really need to organize my thoughts.

176
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,813
Your thoughts?

177
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,813
Plural?

178
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,513
All right, fine.
l only have one thought.

179
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,352
lt's about the hot nanny!
l gotta see her!

180
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,889
-l'm afraid l can't let you do that, Joe.
-Now you're saying l can't see her?

181
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:44,560
You're killing me! She's forbidden fruit!
lt's like, like...

182
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,536
...like she's the princess
and l'm the stable boy.

183
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:52,502
Look, l know. She's the most
beautiful woman in the world.

184
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,305
l can hear you.

185
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:58,777
Could you set my pillow and blanket
on the couch for me, please?

186
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,684
Why are you doing this, huh?

187
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,221
Did Ross tell you not to let me
go over there?

188
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,154
Yes, as a matter of fact, he did.
So l can't let you go.

189
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:12,191
lnteresting. Now there are obstacles.

190
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,859
Hot nanny and me against the world!

191
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,163
This is the stuff great novels
are made of.

192
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,965
-Great novels?
-Fine. Mediocre porn.

193
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,939
-Gavin Mitchell's office.
-Rachel Greene's office.

194
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,673
Give me that phone.

195
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:35,849
Hello, this is Rachel Greene.
How can l help you?

196
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:40,881
Okay then.
l'll pass you back to your son.

197
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,894
Hey, Mom.
No, that's just my secretary.

198
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,969
Excuse me, Gavin.
l have a question l need to ask you.

199
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:54,197
Mom, l'll call you later. Yeah.

200
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:57,874
-Yes?
-lf you like looking at butts so much...

201
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:01,501
...why don't you just go
look in a mirror?

202
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,780
Thank God you finally said that.

203
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,248
l saw you make a note on your pad
three hours ago.

204
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,655
-Man, l really bug you. Don't l?
-Oh, no. Please...

205
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,656
...l don't care about you
enough to bug me.

206
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:18,319
ln fact, from now on,
l'm going to take the high road...

207
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,989
...and l'm going to be very, very nice
to you, you mama's boy...

208
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,533
...starting right now.

209
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,238
-Hey, Rach.
-Hi.

210
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,237
-Ready for your birthday lunch?
-l am.

211
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,468
But first, Monica,
l would like to introduce you...

212
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,808
...to my very talented colleague
and more importantly...

213
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,814
...my wonderful friend, Gavin Mitchell.

214
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,814
-Pleased to meet you.
-Pleased to meet you.

215
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,544
Are you coming to Rachel's party?

216
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:46,122
Oh, no, no, no, no. Gavin can't.
He already has plans...

217
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,760
...most likely with his mother.

218
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,661
l don't mind. l'll cancel them. l would
never miss my secretary's birthday.

219
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:59,932
Why did you invite him?
l can't stand that guy!

220
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,607
-You were being so nice to him.
-l was faking it.

221
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,606
Can't you tell when l'm being fake?

222
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,211
Hey, Mr. Phillips. Nice suit.

223
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,349
Right there.
That was so fake!

224
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,953
Hey, Chandler, which do you like better...

225
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,426
...the tuna tartare
or the mushroom empanadas?

226
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:31,770
-The pile of raw fish, or the tacos?
-Oh, the tacos. Definitely, the tacos.

227
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,532
l still can't believe you invited Gavin.

228
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:40,576
He is just the last person
l want to see.

229
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:44,306
You're welcome for the party.
l'm glad you're having a good time.

230
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:48,179
l hope he doesn't show up.
Of course he won't, the guy hates me.

231
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,379
-Does he?
-What?

232
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,882
Maybe he keeps bothering you
so much because he likes you.

233
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,755
lt's like in first grade
when Skippy Lange would push me...

234
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,397
...because he secretly
had a crush on me.

235
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:02,795
Monica, you think Skippy liked you?

236
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:06,267
Honey, all those boys had a bet
to see if he could knock you over.

237
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,401
-She's out. l'm gonna take her home.
-Okay. Thank you.

238
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,045
Bye, sweetheart.

239
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:19,307
Do you see what all the guys
see in her?

240
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:22,043
Wouldn't kick her out of bed.

241
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,021
No more vodka for me.

242
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,325
Hey, Rach. So can l sing
''Happy Birthday'' to you now?

243
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:32,019
-Yeah, sure.
-All right.

244
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,791
See you later.

245
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,566
Hey, Rach. Somebody got you shoes.

246
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:39,931
Give me!

247
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:46,534
-Wow. Wow. Oh, my God!
-Careful! Careful!

248
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:49,077
These are my rat babies!

249
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:55,253
Yeah. We have rat babies now.

250
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,452
You brought rats
to my birthday party?

251
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,594
So this is what a stroke feels like.

252
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,128
Well, l had to bring them.
We killed their mother.

253
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,528
They're our responsibility now.

254
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:12,660
You know, they require constant care.
You should know that, you're a mother.

255
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,373
Are you comparing my daughter
to a rat?

256
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,577
No. Seven rats.

257
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,444
We should take them home.
We need to feed them.

258
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,379
You're gonna leave my party
to take care of a box of rats?

259
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,984
Well, l'm sorry, Rachel,
but l'm not like you. Okay?

260
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,816
Not everyone can afford help.

261
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,165
Hey, where the hell
are Joey and Molly?

262
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,823
l asked you to watch them.

263
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,526
l'm sorry. l got a little preoccupied.

264
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,698
Look, we have to stop them
before something happens.

265
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,704
Right behind you, big guy.

266
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,811
So you see, Molly,
what people don't understand...

267
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,679
...is that acting is a discipline.
lt takes a lot of hard work.

268
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,753
-So where'd you study?
-l didn't go to college.

269
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:09,859
-No, where'd you study acting?
-Molly, people don't study acting.

270
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:16,531
Molly, do you mind giving us
just a minute?

271
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,999
-Sure. l'll go check on Emma.
-Thanks.

272
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,999
Will the stable boy
never get the princess?

273
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:28,507
What do you think you were gonna do,
have sex with her here on my couch?

274
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,911
No. The leather sticks to my ass.

275
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,517
This isn't fair. What makes you think
l'm gonna sleep with her...

276
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,053
...and then blow her off, huh?

277
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:42,660
Can't you guys open your minds to
the possibility that l actually like her...

278
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,659
...and might want something real?

279
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:51,362
Look, the truth is, l haven't felt
this way about anyone since Rachel.

280
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,734
Okay?
l didn't think l could ever love again.

281
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,197
-Come on!
-Joe!

282
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,881
Hi. ls Molly here?

283
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,780
Yeah, yeah. Come on in. Molly?

284
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:13,623
-Hey. Guys, this is Tabitha.
-Hey.

285
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,587
-l'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.

286
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:32,106
Well, Joey, l guess
we have no problem.

287
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:37,080
lt's like my favorite fairy tale
come true.

288
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,784
The princess, the stable boy
and the lesbian.

289
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,521
Okay. Okay,
you start preparing the formula...

290
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,421
...and l'll start changing the box.

291
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,723
And then we gotta put them
straight to bed.

292
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,796
When did we become
one of those couples...

293
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,458
...whose lives revolve around
their rats?

294
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,800
Well, you know what?
They're our responsibility now.

295
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,499
Okay, fine.
These rats are our responsibility.

296
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,110
What happens when they mate
and there are hundreds?

297
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,282
Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.

298
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,051
Yeah, not such a problem with rats.

299
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:17,654
No, they're more of a ''love the one
you're with'' kind of animal.

300
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,516
No. Really?

301
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:24,150
Oh, my-- Get off your sister!

302
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,356
Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?

303
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,662
The-- We have seven rats.

304
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,465
So, what if each of them
has seven rats...

305
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,576
...and then each of those
has seven rats? That's like....

306
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,808
That's math l can't even do!

307
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,785
What are we gonna do?

308
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,386
Well, l know this is gonna
sound crazy...

309
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:57,155
...but we could
not let the box of rats ruin our lives.

310
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,759
Yeah, okay. l guess you're right.

311
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,302
All right, so we should just
give them away.

312
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:12,400
But to nice families with children
and reduced-fat Wheat Thins.

313
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,944
Those were Bob's favorites.

314
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,047
lt's gonna be okay.

315
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,116
-You must think l'm crazy.
-No, l think you're sweet.

316
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:28,749
Good. This is just so hard.
lt's hard for me to let them go.

317
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:32,886
l guess it just brings back memories,
you know...

318
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:38,335
...from when l gave birth to my brother's
triplets and l had to give them up.

319
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,743
l haven't told you about that yet,
have l?

320
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,556
Thanks for the party, honey.
Should l help you clean up?

321
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:07,062
No way. You had your party.
Now l have mine.

322
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,296
-ls everything all right?
-l just get bummed...

323
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:13,961
...when my birthday's over.

324
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:17,370
Well, at least you have one thing
to be happy about.

325
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:20,568
That jerk, Gavin, from your office
didn't show up.

326
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,442
Yeah, l hate him.

327
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,747
We weren't talking about you.
We were....

328
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,822
No. No way to recover. No. Okay.

329
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,929
-Fun party.
-Well, it was.

330
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,894
And you would have seen it
if you didn't show up at....

331
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:46,561
9:30?! God! This party was lame.

332
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:49,669
Again, you're welcome!

333
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:54,540
-Look, l'll just give you this and go.
-You bought me a present. Why?

334
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:59,411
Let me explain how birthday parties
usually work. There are presents...

335
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:02,417
...and a cake,
perhaps a fourth or fifth person.

336
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,724
Okay, l....

337
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:10,861
l got you the present to make up
for being such a jerk to you.

338
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:16,024
Well, okay. Well, that's very nice.
And you wrote a card.

339
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,403
-''From Gavin.''
-l really mean it.

340
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,203
lt's beautiful.

341
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,608
lf you don't mind...?
Let me.

342
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:36,149
Well, what do you know, it fits.

343
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:42,593
See, Gavin. You're capable of being
a nice guy.

344
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,820
Why do you give me such a hard time?

345
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,622
l'm not sure.

346
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:52,836
Well, Monica seems to think
it's because you have feelings for me.

347
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,130
l do have feelings for you.

348
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,170
-You do?
-Yes. l feel that you're a little annoying.

349
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:02,977
See, why? Gavin, why?

350
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:07,275
Right when l'm about to change
my opinion of you, you go and you--

351
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:13,352
And you do that.

352
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:42,483
Hey. Listen,
l think l left something here.

353
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,557
Well, somebody left this.
ls this yours?

354
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,225
No, but l like it.

355
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,397
No, l think l left one of my rat babies.

356
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:57,033
Well, no. l haven't seen it,
but if l do, l'll let you know.

357
00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:00,501
Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
Rat baby!

358
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:03,097
Maybe that's him.

359
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,535
