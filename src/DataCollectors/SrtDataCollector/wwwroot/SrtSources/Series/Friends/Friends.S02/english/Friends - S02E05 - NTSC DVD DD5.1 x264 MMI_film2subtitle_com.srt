1
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:08,435
Man, I sure miss Julie.

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,438
Spanish midgets.

3
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,806
Spanish midgets wrestling...

4
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,542
Julie!
Okay, I see how you got there.

5
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:26,453
You ever figure out
what that thing's for?

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,625
I'm trying this screening thing.

7
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:32,559
If I always answer the phone,
people will think I have no life.

8
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,025
My God!
Rodrigo never gets pinned!

9
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,803
At the sound of the beep,
you know what to do.

10
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,869
Hello. I'm looking for Bob.

11
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,333
This is Jade.

12
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:45,542
I don't know if you 're still
at this number, but I was thinking...

13
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:49,111
...about how great it was.
I know it's been three years...

14
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,647
...but I was hoping
we could hook up again.

15
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,854
I barely had the nerve
to make this call...

16
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,282
...so you know what I did?
- What?

17
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,491
I got a little drunk...

18
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,658
...and naked.

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,188
Bob here!

20
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:08,397
The One With Five
Steaks and An Eggplant

21
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,245
So what have you been up to?

22
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,107
Oh, you know, the usual.

23
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,680
Teaching aerobics...

24
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,679
...partying way too much.

25
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,780
And in case you wondered...

26
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,958
...those are my legs on
the new James Bond poster.

27
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,396
Can you hold on?
I have another call.

28
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,327
- I love her!
- I know.

29
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,670
- I'm back.
- So are we gonna get together?

30
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:20,837
Absolutely.

31
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,166
How about tomorrow afternoon?

32
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:26,071
Do you know Central Perk?
Say, five-ish?

33
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,405
Great. I'll see you then.

34
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,013
Having a phone has finally paid off.

35
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,620
You do a good Bob impression...

36
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,520
...but when she
sees you tomorrow...

37
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,093
...she's gonna realize
you're not Bob.

38
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:59,004
I'm hoping that when
Bob doesn't show up...

39
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:03,146
...she'll seek comfort in the arms of
the stranger at the next table.

40
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:06,045
Oh, my God.
You are pure evil.

41
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:08,943
Okay, pure evil...

42
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,379
...horny and alone.

43
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,893
I've done this.

44
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,765
Yeah, everybody's here.

45
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,534
Hey, everybody!
Say hi to Julie in New Mexico!

46
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,209
Hi, Julie.

47
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,009
While Ross is on the phone...

48
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,114
...everybody owes me
62 bucks for his birthday.

49
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:41,647
Is there any chance that
you're rounding up from...

50
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:44,350
...you know...

51
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,181
...from like 20?

52
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,194
Hey, we got the gift,
the concert and the cake.

53
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,022
Do we need a cake?

54
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,266
I know it's a little steep.

55
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,004
But it's Ross.

56
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,633
It's Ross.

57
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,067
See you later.
I gotta go...

58
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,970
...do a thing!

59
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,542
Okay, sweetheart,
I'll call you later.

60
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,285
You're not going
through with this, are you?

61
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,951
You know, I think I might just.

62
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,054
What are you guys
doing for dinner tonight?

63
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,364
Well, I gotta start
saving up for Ross' birthday.

64
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,301
I guess I'll just stay home
and eat dust bunnies.

65
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,832
Can you believe
how much this costs?

66
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,374
Do you guys ever
get the feeling that...

67
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,042
...Chandler and those guys...

68
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,341
...don't get that
we don't make that much money?

69
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,678
They always say
let's go here, let's go there.

70
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,785
Like we can afford to go
here and there.

71
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:53,349
Yes, and we always have to go to,
you know, someplace nice.

72
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:58,561
And we can't say anything about it,
because this is a birthday thing...

73
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,129
...and it's "for Ross."

74
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,866
For Ross.

75
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:05,696
Oh, my God!

76
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,274
I'm at work...

77
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,403
...just an ordinary day,
chop, chop, saute, saute.

78
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,405
Suddenly, Leon, the manager,
calls me into his office.

79
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,584
They fired the lunch chef,
and guess who got the job?

80
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,548
If it's not you,
this is a horrible story.

81
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,048
Fortunately, it is me.

82
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,760
And they made me head of purchasing,
thank you!

83
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,552
That's so cool!

84
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,997
Anyway, I think we
should go out and celebrate.

85
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,167
You know, someplace nice.

86
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,274
Someplace nice.

87
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,234
How much you think
I can get for my kidney?

88
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,653
You can't do this.

89
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,886
I can't get a girl like that
with conventional methods.

90
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,157
It doesn't matter.

91
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:05,296
She wanted to call Bob. Bob could be
who she was meant to be with.

92
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,500
You may be destroying
their chance for happiness.

93
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,168
We don't know Bob.

94
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:14,570
We know me. We like me.
Please let me be happy.

95
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,909
Go over there
and tell that woman the truth.

96
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,102
All right.

97
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:23,544
Go.

98
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,351
Listen, I have to...

99
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,588
I have to confess something.

100
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,161
Yes?

101
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,203
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.

102
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,164
- How did you
- I don't know.

103
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:54,573
I just had this weird sense.
But that's me, I'm weird and sensitive.

104
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,717
Tissue?

105
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:00,815
Thanks.

106
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,117
No, you keep the pack.

107
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,447
I'm all cried out today.

108
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,842
Here is to my sister,
the newly appointed head lunch chef.

109
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,978
Also in charge of purchasing.

110
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:31,080
Head lunch chef,
also in charge of purchasing

111
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,547
Who has her own little desk
when Roland's not there.

112
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:39,223
Lunch chef, purchasing, own little
desk when Roland's not there...

113
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,519
...here's to my
- Wait! And I got a beeper!

114
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,963
That's fine, I'll just wait.

115
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,233
Sorry.

116
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,167
Monica!

117
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,605
Are we ready to order?

118
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,401
We haven't even looked yet.

119
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,269
When you do, let me know.

120
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,208
I'll be over there
on the edge of my seat.

121
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,288
Look at these prices!

122
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,114
Yeah, these are pretty "cha-ching."

123
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,160
I know! What are these,
famous chickens?

124
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,123
Sorry I'm late.
Congratulations, Mon.

125
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:25,335
I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible
was my afternoon with Jade?

126
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:29,063
Pretty incredible, according to
the message on my machine.

127
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:34,006
Why is this woman leaving a message
for you on my machine?

128
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,178
I told her that
my number was yours...

129
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,315
...because I couldn't
tell her it was mine...

130
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:41,518
...because she thinks
my number is Bob's number.

131
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,291
Tell me again.
What do I do when Mr. Roper calls?

132
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,085
Do I dare ask?

133
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,763
I'll start with the carpaccio,
and then the grilled prawns.

134
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,261
Great, same for me.

135
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,332
And for the gentleman?

136
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,160
I'll have the Thai chicken pizza.

137
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,497
But if I get it without
the nuts and leeks and stuff...

138
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,674
...is it cheaper?

139
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,138
You'd think, wouldn't you?

140
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,614
I will have the side salad.

141
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,444
And what would that
be on the side of?

142
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:16,350
I don't know.

143
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,624
Just put it right here
next to my water.

144
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,453
And for you?

145
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,694
I'm gonna have a cup
of the cucumber soup and...

146
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,269
...take care.

147
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,301
I will have the Cajun catfish.

148
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,340
Anything else?

149
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,070
Yes, how about a verse of
"Killing Me Softly"?

150
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,977
You're gonna sneeze
in my fish, aren't you?

151
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,593
Plus tip, divided by six...

152
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,793
Everyone owes 28 bucks.

153
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,871
Everyone?

154
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,869
Oh! You're right, I'm sorry.

155
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,073
Thank you.

156
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,905
It's Monica's big night.
She shouldn't pay.

157
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,041
So five of us is...

158
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,813
...33. 50 a piece.

159
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,453
No. No way.
Sorry, not gonna happen.

160
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,553
Prom night flashback.

161
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,558
Sorry, Monica.
I'm happy you got promoted...

162
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,960
...but cold cucumber mush
for 30-something bucks?

163
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,256
No!

164
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,138
Rachel just had that little salad...

165
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,740
...and Joey with his teeny pizza!

166
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,800
Okay, Pheebs.

167
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,107
How about we'll each
pay for what we had?

168
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,576
It's no big deal.

169
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,714
Not for you.

170
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,755
All right, what's going on?

171
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,884
I don't wanna get
into this right now.

172
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,152
It'll make everybody uncomfortable.

173
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,298
You can tell us.

174
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,433
Yeah, hello? It's us.
We'll be fine.

175
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,143
We three...

176
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,106
...feel like that...

177
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,247
...sometimes you guys don't get that...

178
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,023
We don't have
as much money as you.

179
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,263
I hear you.

180
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,035
We can talk about that.

181
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,331
Well, then...

182
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,232
...let's.

183
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,309
I guess I just never think
of money as an issue.

184
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,641
- Because you have it.
- Good point!

185
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,716
So how come you guys
haven't talked about this before?

186
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:07,686
Because it's always something.
Like with Monica's new job...

187
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,555
...or the whole Ross' birthday hoopla.

188
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:17,060
I don't want my birthday to be
the source of any kind of negative...

189
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,168
There's gonna be a hoopla?

190
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:26,201
Basically there's the thing,
and then the stuff after the thing

191
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,913
If it makes anybody feel better,
forget the thing...

192
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,140
...and we'll just do the gift.

193
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,909
Gift? The thing's not the gift?

194
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,717
No, we were gonna go see
Hootie and the Blowfish.

195
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,389
Hootie and the

196
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,923
I can catch them on the radio.

197
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:47,160
No. Now I feel bad.
You wanna go to the concert.

198
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,765
No, look. It's my birthday...

199
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:53,130
...and the important thing
is that we're all together.

200
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,303
- All of us.
- Together.

201
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,302
Not at the concert.

202
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,277
Thank you.

203
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:11,018
So, the Ebola virus.
That's gotta suck, huh?

204
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,126
Gee, Monica.
What's in the bag?

205
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,922
I don't know, Chandler.
Let's take a look.

206
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,067
Oh, it's like a skit.

207
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,467
Why, it's dinner for six.
Five steaks...

208
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,072
...and an eggplant for Phoebe.

209
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:36,012
We switched suppliers at work, and
they gave me the steaks as a thank-you.

210
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:40,446
But wait, there's more.
Chandler, what is in that envelope?

211
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,481
By the way, this didn't
seem so dorky out in the hall.

212
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,592
Why, it's six tickets to
Hootie and the Blowfish!

213
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,232
The Blowfish!

214
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,829
It's on us. So don't worry.
This is...

215
00:13:59,071 --> 00:13:59,867
...our treat.

216
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:02,639
Thank you.

217
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,473
Could you be less enthused?

218
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:10,113
Look, it's a nice gesture. It is.

219
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,077
But it just feels like...

220
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,583
Like?

221
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,182
Charity.

222
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,512
Charity?

223
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,120
We're just trying
to do a nice thing here.

224
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:23,419
But you have to understand, your
"nice thing" makes us feel about this big.

225
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,597
Actually, it makes us feel that big.

226
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:32,397
I don't understand.
We can't win with you guys.

227
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,730
If you guys feel this big,
maybe that's not our fault.

228
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,872
Maybe that's just how you feel.

229
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,407
Now you're telling us how we feel.

230
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,649
We never should have talked about this.

231
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,011
I'm gonna pass on the concert.

232
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:51,121
I'm just not in a very
"Hootie" place right now.

233
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,955
- Me neither.
- Me too.

234
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,386
Guys, we bought the tickets.

235
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,189
Then you'll have extra seats
for all your tiaras and stuff.

236
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,766
Why did you look at me
when you said that?

237
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,938
So I guess now we can't go.

238
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:16,511
Do what you want. Do we always
have to do everything together?

239
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,517
You know what? You're right.

240
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,583
Fine.

241
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:25,985
All right.

242
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,655
We're gonna go.

243
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,701
It's not for another six hours.
We're gonna go then.

244
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:49,907
Are you ready?

245
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,448
Just let me grab my jacket
and tell you I had sex today.

246
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,622
What? You had sex today?

247
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,191
It sounds even cooler
when somebody else says it!

248
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:06,858
I was awesome. She was biting her lip
to stop from screaming.

249
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,834
I know it's been a while,
but I took that as a good sign.

250
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,666
Still doing the screening?

251
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,805
I had sex today.

252
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,146
I never have to
answer that phone again.

253
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,475
At the sound of the beep,
you know what to do.

254
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,083
Hey, Bob. It's Jade.

255
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:33,155
I wanted to tell you I was really hurt
when you didn't show up yesterday.

256
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:37,259
And just so you know,
I ended up meeting a guy.

257
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,163
Bob here.

258
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,993
So you met someone, huh?

259
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,669
Yes, I did.

260
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:49,429
In fact, I had sex
with him two hours ago.

261
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,806
So how was he?

262
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,523
Oh, Bob, he was nothing
compared to you.

263
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,789
I bit my lip to keep from
screaming your name.

264
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,028
Well, that makes me feel so good.

265
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,534
It was just so awkward and bumpy.

266
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:29,744
Maybe he had some kind of new style
that you're not familiar with.

267
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:31,947
You have to get used to it.

268
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,515
There wasn't much time
to get used to it...

269
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,687
...if you know what I mean.

270
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,700
You know what? I'm not gonna
be able to enjoy this.

271
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:53,200
I know. It's my birthday.
We all should be here.

272
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,406
So let's go.

273
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,346
Well, maybe we should stay
for one song.

274
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,383
It would be rude to them
for us to leave now.

275
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,247
The guys are probably
having a great time.

276
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,894
Come on, you guys.
One more time.

277
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:18,860
One.

278
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,136
- Amazing!
- Excellent!

279
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,071
I can't believe the guys missed it!

280
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,212
What guys?
Oh, yeah.

281
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,550
Excuse me.
Aren't you Monica Geller?

282
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,351
- Do I know you?
- You were my baby-sitter!

283
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,518
Oh, my God!
Little Stevie Fisher?

284
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,224
How have you been?

285
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,120
Good. I'm a lawyer now.

286
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,626
You can't be a lawyer.
You're 8.

287
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,964
It was nice to see you.
I gotta run backstage.

288
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,393
Wait, backstage?

289
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,159
My firm represents the band.

290
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,007
You guys wanna meet the group?

291
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:05,605
Come on.

292
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:09,143
Are you one of the ones
that fooled around with my Dad?

293
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:15,482
Hey, you guys!

294
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:16,618
Happy birthday!

295
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,482
Oh, thank you.

296
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,719
How was your night last night?

297
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,454
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked.
How was yours?

298
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,358
Ours pretty much sucked too.

299
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:32,033
But I ran into Stevie Fisher.
Remember him?

300
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,362
Oh, yeah!
I used to baby-sit him.

301
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,163
Hey, how's his dad?

302
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,604
Good.

303
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,209
Aside from that, the evening
was pretty much a bust.

304
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:46,315
Yeah, we really missed you guys.

305
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:50,283
Yeah, we were just saying,
this whole thing is so stupid.

306
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:55,585
We just have to really, really
not let stuff like money, get like

307
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,085
Is that a hickey?

308
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,025
Oh, no, I just...

309
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,028
I fell down.

310
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,067
On someone's lips?

311
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,032
Where'd you get the hickey?

312
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,604
You know, a party or

313
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:12,605
What party?

314
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,369
It wasn't a party
so much as a...

315
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,410
...a gathering of people.

316
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,044
With food and music and...

317
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,945
...and the band.

318
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,482
You partied with
Hootie and the Blowfish?

319
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:30,626
Yes. Apparently, Stevie and Hootie
are like this.

320
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,156
Who gave you that hickey?

321
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,662
That would be the work of a Blowfish.

322
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,735
I can't believe it!
I can't believe this!

323
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:46,434
We're just sitting at home,
trying to guess Joey's fingers...

324
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,674
...and you're partying
and having fun and all:

325
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,010
"Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck!"

326
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,248
Don't blame us.
You could've been there.

327
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:04,359
What? As part of your
"poor friends outreach program"?

328
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,592
Oh, great. It's work.

329
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:10,528
I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry we make more than you.

330
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,863
But we're not gonna feel guilty.
We work really hard.

331
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,739
And we don't work hard?

332
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,566
It's Monica. I got a page.

333
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,768
It's just that sometimes we like
to do stuff that costs a little more.

334
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,073
And you feel like we hold you back.

335
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,079
Leon, wait.

336
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,119
Guys!

337
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,183
I don't understand.

338
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,553
The steaks were a gift
from the meat vendor.

339
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,523
That was not a kickback.

340
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:42,431
I'll just replace them,
and we can forget the whole thing.

341
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,597
What corporate policy?

342
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,045
I just got fired.

343
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,552
Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.

344
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,989
Let me get that.

345
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,025
You got 5 bucks?

346
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,477
Here comes the beep.
You know what to do.

347
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,573
Hi, it's me.

348
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,814
Listen, Bob.
I'm probably way out of line here.

349
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:42,857
It's been three years, and you 're
probably seeing someone else now...

350
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:46,929

One hot, steamy, wild night...
