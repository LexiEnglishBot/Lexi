1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,757
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too.

2
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:11,301
You know, instead of watching football,
you could help.

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,178
We know.

4
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:17,975
Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows
in concentric circles.

5
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,438
No, you want to put them
in concentric circles.

6
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,648
I want to do this.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,076
Every year.

8
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,709
To the 10, to the 5. Touchdown, Giants!

9
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:31,173
You know, for once, I am gonna try
to watch one of these things.

10
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,759
Halftime.

11
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,931
Who wants to, uh, throw the ball around?
Get a little 3-on-3 going?

12
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,809
- Oh, that would be so much fun!
- Can I play too?

13
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,394
I've never played football, ever.

14
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,021
Great! You can cover Chandler.

15
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,400
I don't... I don't really want to play.

16
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,612
You never do anything
since you and Janice broke up.

17
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,822
Not true.

18
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:58,534
I wanted to wear my bathrobe
and eat peanut clusters all day.

19
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,995
And start drinking in the morning.
Don't say I don't have goals!

20
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,374
You have to start getting
over her, all right?

21
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:09,336
If you play, maybe it'll
take your mind off Janice.

22
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:13,966
If you don't, everyone will be mad at
you because the teams won't be even.

23
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:15,968
All right, I'll play.

24
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,387
- Yay!
- Yay! Let's do it! Ross?

25
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,514
- What?
- Wanna play football?

26
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,433
Um...

27
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,687
Monica and I aren't supposed
to play football.

28
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,898
Says who? Your mom? Ha-ha-ha.

29
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,358
Yes.

30
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:37,906
Ahem. Every Thanksgiving, um,
we used to have a touch football game...

31
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,700
...called The Geller Bowl.

32
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,202
No, no, no. You say that proudly!

33
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,707
Anyway, Ross and I
were always captains, and, um...

34
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,544
It got kind of competitive.
And one year, Geller Bowl VI...

35
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,964
...I accidentally broke Ross' nose.

36
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,593
It was so not an accident.

37
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,845
She saw I was about to tag her,
so she threw...

38
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,140
...her big fat grandma-arm
elbow in my face...

39
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,225
...and just kept running.

40
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,394
To score the winning touchdown,
by the way.

41
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,188
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Heh.

42
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,232
Uh, you did not win the game.
The touchdown didn't count...

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,321
...because of the spectacularly illegal,
and savage, nose-breaking.

44
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,865
I won the game.

45
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,452
Yeah? Then how come you
didn't get the Geller Cup?

46
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,914
Ahem, there was a Geller Cup?

47
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,250
Yes, the trophy you got
if you won the game.

48
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,837
But Dad said nobody won,
and he was sick of our fighting.

49
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,256
So he took the trophy...

50
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,514
...threw it in the lake.

51
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,267
And was the curse lifted?

52
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,979
Anyway...

53
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,441
...Mom said we weren't
allowed to play football again.

54
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,986
You know what?
I think we should play a game.

55
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,030
I mean, come on. It's been 12 years.

56
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,950
Can I see you for a second?

57
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,455
Wuss!

58
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,999
All right, we're gonna play.

59
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,337
Wait. How we gonna get there?
My mom won't let me cross the street.

60
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,302
Here you go.

61
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,720
All right.

62
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,514
- Let's bring it in.
- Wait.

63
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,140
Honey, throw it to me!

64
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,559
- Here you go.
- Aah!

65
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,772
That almost hit me in the face!

66
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,732
We have to pick captains.

67
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,151
And then "Tennilles."

68
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,655
So how do we decide that?

69
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,074
- Why don't we just bunny up?
- What?

70
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,326
- Bunny!
- Bunny!

71
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,162
Looks like Ross and I are captains.

72
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,208
Okay, so, um, I bunnied first,
so I get to pick first. Joey.

73
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,335
- Thank you.
- Monica.

74
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,337
I'm your best friend.

75
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,715
Sweetie, don't worry, you'll get picked.

76
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,717
Chandler.

77
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,637
- Ross?
- Phoebe.

78
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,976
Sweetie, now I pick you.

79
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,563
You don't pick me.
You're stuck with me!

80
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,898
Okay. All right. So let's see.

81
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,319
Let's play from the, uh,
trash can to the light post, right?

82
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,862
Two-hand touch. We'll kick off.

83
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,740
People, listen.
I've got 28 minutes...

84
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,075
...before I have to baste again.

85
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,202
Wow, just like in the pros.

86
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,538
- Okay, huddle up! Whoo!
- Woo-hoo.

87
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:35,417
- Huddle up over here!
- Wait for me! Wait for me!

88
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,502
Oh, cool! My first huddle.

89
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,504
- Okay.
- Ha, ha. Okay.

90
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,799
So what do you guys really think
of Chandler?

91
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:47,095
- You know what you're doing, right?
- Yeah.

92
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,556
Okay. Joey will catch it. We'll block.

93
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,391
What's "block"?

94
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:55,687
- I thought you knew what you were doing.
- I thought you meant in life!

95
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,231
Break!

96
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,610
The ball is Janice.
The ball is Janice.

97
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,201
Ow! Son of a...! Ow!

98
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,411
- Come on!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

99
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,081
You know what?
We're just gonna throw it.

100
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,917
I got it!

101
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,502
Go, go, go!

102
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,472
Score! Seven to nothing!

103
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:31,973
Honey, you okay?

104
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,475
Come on, let's go.

105
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,310
Whoo. Losers walk.

106
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,146
Yeah? Losers talk.

107
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,941
No, no, actually, losers rhyme.

108
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,361
Forty-three...

109
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,612
...74...

110
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,284
- You wanna go shotgun?
- Yeah.

111
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,871
Hike.

112
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,958
- One Mississippi...
- Over here! Over here! Unh.

113
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,043
Ha! I almost caught that one!

114
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,631
Great. Now the score's
seven to almost seven.

115
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:09,803
Okay, on this play, I want you to do
a down-and-out to the right, okay?

116
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,763
- Break!
- Wait. What am I gonna do?

117
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,223
You?

118
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,433
You go long.

119
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,892
How long?

120
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,894
Until we start to look very small.

121
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,772
- Okay. Break!
- Break!

122
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,983
- Set, hike!
- One Mississippi...

123
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,860
Switch! Switch! Switch!

124
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,778
No, no, no, no!

125
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,953
Huhh...

126
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,165
Hey. Thanks for stopping our ball.

127
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,292
You are playing American football?

128
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,501
Yeah.

129
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,713
Wow, you're, like,
from a whole other country!

130
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,550
- I'm Dutch.
- Hi, I'm Joey.

131
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,260
I am Margha.

132
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:54,055
- Sorry, Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.
- Ha-ha-ha.

133
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,892
You wanna play football or...?
Hi, I'm Chandler.

134
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,935
Hello, Chandler.

135
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,522
Her name is Dutch and also "Margham."

136
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,275
- Margha.
- Margha.

137
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,568
Margha.

138
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,446
Mahan.

139
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,782
Come on, guys! Let's go!
Second down!

140
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,786
- Uh, hello? It's third down.
- No, it's not. It's second.

141
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,998
- Wow.
- "Wow" what?

142
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,085
It just amazes me that you're
still pulling stuff like this. Heh.

143
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,715
- Pulling what? It's second down.
- Okay, it's second down.

144
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,635
Take all the second downs you need.

145
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,554
- I heard that.
- Well, I said it loud.

146
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,558
It is okay if I stay and watch?

147
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,895
- Just sit right there.
- Yeah, why don't you stick around?

148
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,772
- That went well.
- I think so.

149
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,900
I was thinking about, uh,
asking her for her number.

150
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,946
Thanks, man, but it makes a stronger
statement if I ask for it myself.

151
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:57,911
I was thinking about for me, as part
of that getting-over-Janice thing.

152
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,121
Oh, yeah. That.

153
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,874
If it means that much,
I'll let you have her.

154
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,125
Thanks.

155
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,128
Wh...? "Let me have her"?

156
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,590
You mean if you didn't,
I wouldn't have a shot?

157
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,593
I don't like to say it out loud...

158
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,387
...but yeah!

159
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:20,141
We all have our strengths.
You're better with numbers and stuff.

160
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,895
Math? You're giving me math?

161
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,148
All right, you know what?
Forget about it.

162
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,693
You go for the girl.
We'll see who gets her.

163
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,033
I want you to run a post-pattern
to the left. And, sweetie...

164
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,535
Yeah, I know. Go long.

165
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,288
All I'm doing is running
back and forth from the huddle.

166
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,585
Well, uh, you wanna just stay out there?

167
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,254
- Can I see that for a second?
- Yeah.

168
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,467
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go.

169
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,177
- I got Chandler
- Hike!

170
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,972
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi.

171
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,682
Fumble!

172
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,649
What's the matter with you?
This is my favorite jersey.

173
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,277
Well, now you have two.

174
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,655
Hey, I am good at math!

175
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,867
That's it.
I was still gonna let you have her.

176
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,786
But now,
prepare to feel bad about yourself.

177
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,290
I've been preparing for that
my entire life!

178
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,168
Or something about you that's mean!

179
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,503
Come on, guys. Let's go.

180
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,589
Tie score.
We're running out of time.

181
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,257
Forty-two, 38, hike!

182
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,677
I got it! Ooh! Ugh!

183
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,138
Broken boobs! Ow.

184
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,724
- Pheebs, run!
- Run, Phoebe! Run!

185
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,935
- God! Touchdown! Touchdown!
- Yes! Touchdown! Hey, oh!

186
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,022
No, no, no.

187
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,858
Uh, the buzzer buzzed.
It doesn't count.

188
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,110
- After the snap.
- Before the snap.

189
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,487
- After.
- Before.

190
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,405
- Does it really matter?
- Yes!

191
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,284
But I made a touchdown.
It was my first touchdown.

192
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,245
Pheebs, that's great. Doesn't count.

193
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,040
- Does so count.
- Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.

194
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,710
Oh, my God!

195
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,674
That's fine. Maybe you haven't
grown up, but I have.

196
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,592
- Oh, okay.
- Dead leg!

197
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,678
Ugh, oh! Oh.

198
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,264
Okay, fine. You want to win
by cheating, go ahead.

199
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,392
The touchdown does count. You win.

200
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,686
- Whoo! Yay!
- No!

201
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,649
I won't do this again. I wanna
beat you when you can't blame it...

202
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,736
...on the broken nose or the buzzer
or the fact that you might have mono.

203
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:40,365
Let's just call this tie score
and it's halftime.

204
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,117
First, I don't play with cheaters.

205
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:45,286
Second of all,
you know I had swollen glands!

206
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,582
You know what? I think you'll play.

207
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,001
Oh, really? Why's that?

208
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,045
Because the winner gets this.

209
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,840
The Geller Cup!

210
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,345
Is everybody else seeing
a troll doll nailed to a two-by-four?

211
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,763
Mm-hm.

212
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,057
Okay, good.

213
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,523
Okay, where the hell did you get that?

214
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,984
When you went to the hospital
for your nose...

215
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,987
...I swam into the lake
and fished it out.

216
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,280
That cup is mine!

217
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,575
No, it's not. You want it,
you're gonna have to win it.

218
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,036
So are we not having dinner at all?

219
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,999
Come on, let's go.
It's time to get serious. Huddle up.

220
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,543
Keep your head in the game.

221
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,046
It's hard, you know?
His huddle's close to the Dutch girl.

222
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,051
If I take Chandler out of the running,
will you be able to focus?

223
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:45,180
- What are you gonna do?
- Just make sure he catches the ball.

224
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,347
I'll do the rest.

225
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,434
- Come on, you wuss!
- Okay, come on.

226
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,061
- Go, Cha... Chandler.
- I got it!

227
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,355
Come on! This way! Come on!

228
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,524
- Look out!
- Oof!

229
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,778
Whoa, whoa.

230
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,031
Tackled by a girl!
Bet you don't see that every day.

231
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,701
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's with the tackling?

232
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,703
What?

233
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,580
I just touched him and he went over.

234
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,751
Okay. You wanna play rough?
We can play rough.

235
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,879
Let's get ready to rumble!

236
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,146
Aah!

237
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,921
- Go, go, go!
- Get her! Get her!

238
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,635
I love this game!

239
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,889
Where'd you get that?

240
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,600
I went really long.

241
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,812
Forty-two to 21.

242
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,439
Like the turkey, Ross is done!

243
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,278
You got to pick first,
so you got the better team.

244
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,447
Pathetic! Why can't you
just accept that we're winning...

245
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,949
...because I'm better than you?

246
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,995
- Pfft!
- Oh, what a great argument. Exhaling!

247
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,497
All right, I'll prove it to you. Okay?

248
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:38,585
I'll trade you Joey for Rachel
and I'll still win the game.

249
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,129
What? The guys against the girls?

250
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,841
That's ridiculous because
I'm only down by three touchdowns.

251
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,759
Oh, then bring it on!

252
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:50,221
Unless you're afraid you might lose
to a bunch of girls.

253
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,810
Fine. Rachel, you're with Monica.
Joey, you're with me.

254
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,146
I can not believe you're trading me.

255
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,482
Let's see what it's like
to be on a winning team for a change.

256
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,318
You're gonna let me play?

257
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,278
All right, then!

258
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,906
The game is over? We eat now?

259
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,991
No, the game's not over.
We're switching teams.

260
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,537
Chandler finds me so intimidating that
it's better if we're on the same team.

261
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,789
Okay, let's play. Let's go.

262
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,374
Oh, uh, hold on a second.

263
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:21,085
Ahem.
Where do Dutch people come from?

264
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,511
Uh, well, the, uh...

265
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,932
...Pennsylvania Dutch
come from Pennsylvania.

266
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,517
And the, uh, other Dutch people?

267
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,479
They come from somewhere near
the Netherlands, right?

268
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,522
Nice try.

269
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,942
The Netherlands
is this make-believe place...

270
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,111
...where Peter Pan
and Tinker Bell come from.

271
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,864
Oh, my.

272
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,701
Enough "geography for the insane."
Let's play ball.

273
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,245
No. No, I'm not playing with this guy.

274
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,998
- Oh, fine with me.
- I've had enough of this.

275
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:03,086
Let's just cut to the chase.
Heidi, which of my boys do you like?

276
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,088
What are you doing?

277
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,881
- What are you doing?
- Shh, shh.

278
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,093
Which do I like?

279
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,013
Yeah, for dating, general merriment,
taking back to your windmill?

280
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,266
Well, if I had to choose right now...

281
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:20,144
...which, by the way,
I find really weird...

282
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,648
...I would have to say Chandler.

283
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,400
Yes!

284
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:29,570
Wait a minute.
She didn't understand the question.

285
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,949
Why don't you have Captain Hook
explain it to her?

286
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,369
I'm sorry. That is my truth.

287
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,123
You hear that? That is her truth,
Mr. "I'll Let You Have Her"!

288
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,084
I win! You suck! I rule all!

289
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,878
Mini-wave in celebration of me!

290
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,881
Woo-hoo!

291
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:55,013
I am now thinking I would like
to change my answer to "no one."

292
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,764
What?

293
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,851
I now find you shallow, and, um...

294
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,769
...a dork.

295
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,855
Bye-bye.

296
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,857
Heh. Nice going.

297
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,693
You just saved yourself
a couple months of sex.

298
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,904
It doesn't matter,
because she picked me.

299
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,157
From now on, I get the dates...

300
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:17,952
...and you stay home on Saturday nights
watching Ready, Set, Cook!

301
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,372
Save the breakthroughs for therapy.
The clock is ticking.

302
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,250
We have no time,
and we are losing to girls.

303
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,044
We're not gonna lose to girls.

304
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,795
It's 42-21!

305
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:31,424
This sucks! I was just up by that much!

306
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,928
Are we playing football or what?
Come on, you hairy-backed Marys!

307
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:40,850
We have to do this.
We're playing for women everywhere.

308
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,561
Think about every lousy date
you ever had.

309
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,773
Every guy who kept one eye
on the TV while you were making out.

310
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,193
Oh, my God. You dated someone
with a glass eye too?

311
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,990
Come on, okay? This is for
all womankind. Let's kill them!

312
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,867
Yeah! Kill them!

313
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,412
All right, I want to kill them too.

314
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,247
But they're boys.

315
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,375
You know, how are we gonna
beat three boys?

316
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,574
A minute and a half left,
and we're down by two points.

317
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:39,951
Two points, ladies.

318
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,376
Phoebe, you do a buttonhook again.

319
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,919
Rachel, you go long.

320
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,840
No, don't make me go long.
Use me. They never cover me.

321
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,758
Honey, there's a reason.

322
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,762
I'm not lame, okay?
I can do something.

323
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,515
Would you let me throw?
This is my game too.

324
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,392
Let her throw the ball.

325
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,271
Sweep behind, I'll pitch it.
You throw it downfield to Phoebe.

326
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,522
Thank you.

327
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,065
- Break!
- Break!

328
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,900
All right, here we go.

329
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,361
Thirty-two, 71, hike!

330
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,947
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi, three Mississippi!

331
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,996
Go, go, go!

332
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,123
- Catch it!
- Ow!

333
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,420
- I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay!

334
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,215
They were coming at me,
and I didn't know what to do.

335
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,467
- Thirty seconds left on the timer.
Woo-hoo.

336
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,762
So we get to take that, uh,
stupid troll thing home.

337
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,891
Come on! Hurry!
We're running out of time.

338
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,767
- Huddle up!
- Okay.

339
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:51,105
Oh! This is our last huddle!

340
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,942
All right, Phoebe, get open. Rachel...

341
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,612
...go long.
- Okay.

342
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,488
Break!

343
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,413
Ahh! I did it! Touchdown! We did it!

344
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:57,463
You know? Funny thing, actually.
The end zone starts at that pole.

345
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,674
So you're five feet short. So...

346
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,551
...ha-ha-ha, we win!
- Whoo!

347
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,304
Yes, yes, yes!

348
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,515
Wait, explain something, though.

349
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:12,019
If nobody tagged Rachel,
then isn't the play still going?

350
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,735
- Let me in! Let me in!
- No way! Let go!

351
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,863
Let go? I'm a tiny little woman!

352
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,324
Guys, come on, it's Thanksgiving!

353
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,868
It's not important who wins or loses.

354
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,997
The important thing
is the Dutch girl picked me!

355
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,169
Me, not you! Holland loves Chandler!
Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!

356
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,717
Ow!

357
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,971
We should play football
more often.

358
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,640
Maybe there's a league
we could join.

359
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,935
Isn't there a "national football league"?

360
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,605
Yes, there is. They play on
Sundays and Monday nights.

361
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,400
Oh, shoot! I work Monday nights.

362
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,901
Aww.

363
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,948
This stuffing is amazing.
Do you think we should bring them some?

364
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,200
When they're hungry, they'll come in.

365
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:11,245
- Let go!
- No, you let go!

366
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:16,250
How come it's always us
left holding the ball?

367
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:20,254
I don't know. I guess the other
people just don't care enough.

368
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,804
Hey, it's starting to snow.

369
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,228
- Give it to me! Let go!
- Let it go! Come on, let go!
