1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:05,546
Okay, so we went to the beach because
Phoebe found out about this lady...

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:06,922
...who knew her mom and dad...

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,383
...and I don't really know
what happened with that.

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,552
- I'm your mother.
- Huh?

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,430
Monica joked that she wouldn't
go out with a guy like Chandler.

6
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:16,098
- Hi there.
- He couldn't let it go.

7
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:20,394
I don't really know what happened with that.
And then Ross' new girlfriend shows up...

8
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,771
...and Rachel convinced her
to shave her head.

9
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,565
And then Ross and Rachel kiss.

10
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,401
And now Ross has to choose
between Rachel and the bald girl.

11
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,404
And I don't know what happened
there either.

12
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,823
You know what? Hold on.
Let me go get Chandler.

13
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,795
Hi.

14
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,464
- Hi.
- Hey.

15
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,718
Rachel was just helping me out.
My head got all sunburned.

16
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,470
Aw.

17
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:58,724
- Thanks a million.
- Oh, you're welcome a million.

18
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,643
- Okay, I'll be in our room.
- Uh.

19
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,532
Oh, my God.

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,326
I know.

21
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,874
- Okay, I gotta go.
- Whoa. What? Why?

22
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,919
Uh, I gotta go break up with Bonnie.

23
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,088
Here? Now?

24
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,465
Well, yeah, I can't stay here all night.

25
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,718
And if I go in there,
she's gonna want to...

26
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,928
...do stuff.

27
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,765
Can't you just tell here
that you are not in the mood?

28
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,433
No, she likes that.

29
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,937
Ha, ha. Yeah, faking sleep
doesn't work either.

30
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,356
I can't tell you how many mornings
I woke up with her...

31
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,024
- Oh.
- Oh, okay.

32
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:54,279
- Ha, ha. Yeah, why am I telling you?
- I don't know. Ha, ha.

33
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,538
Uh, uh...

34
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,124
- It wasn't every morning...
- Oh, making it worse.

35
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,583
Okay.

36
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,761
So I guess you'd like to know
how it all happened.

37
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,472
I mean, well, I think I can figure it out.

38
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,932
I guess, you know, I was born...

39
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,476
...and then everyone
started lying their asses off.

40
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,771
No, no, it wasn't like that.

41
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,442
I mean, remember how I told you
how Lily and Frank and I, we were close?

42
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,361
Well, we were very close.

43
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,988
How close?

44
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,867
Well, the three of us,
we were kind of a, um... A couple.

45
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,038
- I don't even know how that would work.
- Well, we...

46
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,331
I'm not asking.

47
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,919
Well, anyhow, somehow I got pregnant...

48
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,629
...and I was...

49
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:37,591
...scared. I was stupid and selfish and...

50
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,509
I was 18 years old.

51
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,763
I mean, you remember what it was like
to be 18 years old, don't you?

52
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,807
Yeah. Let's see, my mom had killed herself
and my dad had run off.

53
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:49,978
And I was living in a gremlin with a guy
named Cindy, who talked to his hand.

54
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,690
Oh, I'm so sorry.

55
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,610
I thought I was leaving you
with the best parents in the world.

56
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,988
I didn't even hear about your mom and dad
till a couple of years ago.

57
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,074
And by then, you were already grown-up.

58
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,826
I don't know. You're here
and I would really...

59
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,870
I would like to get to know you.

60
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,123
Yeah, well, everybody does. Ha, ha.

61
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,334
I'm a really cool person.

62
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,753
And you know, you had 29 years
to find that out...

63
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,421
...but you didn't even try.

64
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,801
You know what? You walked out on me,
and I'm gonna do the same to you.

65
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,388
- Wait.
- Okay? I don't ever want to see you again.

66
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,102
Where's my purse?

67
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,273
Shoot. We're out of soda.

68
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,191
Oh, I'll go out and get you some.

69
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,278
- Really?
- No, because I'm not your boyfriend.

70
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,532
Hey, Pheebs, how'd it go?

71
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,617
Huh. Well, ahem...

72
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,246
My mom's friend, Phoebe,
is actually my birth mom.

73
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,002
I found a dried-up seahorse.

74
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,379
Sweetie, what are you talking about?

75
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,632
Oh, my new mom,
who's a big fat abandoner.

76
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,050
Oh, wait, Pheebs.

77
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,387
Wait a second. Don't you want to stay here
and talk about it?

78
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,472
No. I just... I wanna...

79
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,641
I need to be alone.

80
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,313
- Monica.
- Oh.

81
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:24,906
It's over.

82
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:30,120
- Oh. Was it awful?
- Well, it was long.

83
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,331
I didn't even realize how late it was...

84
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,042
...till I noticed the five o'clock shadow
on her head.

85
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:45,385
Anyway, she didn't want to stay.
I called a cab. She just left.

86
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,644
I wrote you a letter.

87
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,689
Oh, thank you. Ha, ha.

88
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,233
I like mail.

89
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,823
There's just some things
I've been thinking about.

90
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,575
You know, things about us.

91
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,661
And before we can even think
about the two of us getting back together...

92
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,374
...I just need to know
how you feel about this stuff.

93
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,670
- Okay. Heh.
- Okay.

94
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,717
Well, it's...

95
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,053
It's 5:30 in the morning. Heh.

96
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:35,310
So I'd better get cracking on this baby.

97
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,481
So I'll be waiting for you.
Just come up when you're done.

98
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,651
Okay. I'll be up...

99
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,903
...in 18 pages.

100
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,365
Front and back.

101
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,119
Very exciting.

102
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,221
Oh, oh.

103
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:17,978
Hey.

104
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,480
What happened to you?
Why didn't you come up?

105
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,691
Done.

106
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,446
- You just finished?
- Well, I wanted to be thorough.

107
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:33,243
I mean, this is clearly
very, very important to you. To us.

108
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:37,247
And so I wanted to read
every word carefully.

109
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,457
Twice.

110
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,710
So, um...

111
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,296
Does it?

112
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,970
I'm sorry?

113
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:59,769
Does it?

114
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:07,819
Yeah, I wanted to give that whole
"Does it?" part just another glance.

115
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,156
What are you talking about, Ross?
You just said that you read it twice.

116
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,743
Look, you know what? It either does
or doesn't. And if you have to think...

117
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,497
No, Rach.
No, I don't have to think about it. I don't.

118
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,998
Uh, in fact...

119
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,752
...I've decided. I have decided...

120
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,921
...that it...

121
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,511
...does.

122
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,197
- Are you sure?
- Oh, sure, I'm sure.

123
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:03,583
All right. There's a nuclear holocaust.
I'm the last man on earth.

124
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,126
Would you go out with me?

125
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,089
Ehh.

126
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,759
I've got canned goods.

127
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,389
Hey, you guys, take a look at this.

128
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,517
Check this baby out. Dug me a hole.

129
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,813
Excellent hole, Joe.

130
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,525
Oh, no, no. My hole.

131
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,819
Ow! My foot. Ow!

132
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,404
What? What is it?

133
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:36,074
Jellyfish sting.
Ow, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

134
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,285
Well, can we help you,
take you back to the house?

135
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,703
Oh, it's, like, two miles.

136
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,205
Yeah, and I'm a little tired
from digging the hole.

137
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,625
Damn the jellyfish.

138
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,420
Damn all the jellyfish.

139
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,713
We've gotta do something.

140
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,423
There's only one thing you can do.

141
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,716
What? What is it?

142
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,217
You're gonna have to pee on it.

143
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,054
What? Gross.

144
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,473
Don't blame me.
I saw it on the Discovery Channel.

145
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:04,644
You know what? He's right.
There's something like ammonia in that...

146
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,354
...that kills the pain.

147
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:10,358
Well, forget it. It doesn't hurt that bad!

148
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,403
If you want some privacy,
you can use my hole.

149
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,452
Well, I'm ready
to get the hell out of here.

150
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,537
Oh.

151
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,747
Are you...?

152
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,373
Are you?

153
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,417
Oh, that's so great.

154
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,877
Ooh, not for Bonnie.

155
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,422
But for you, yay, aah.

156
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,800
- Hey.
- How was the beach?

157
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,219
- Nothing. I don't know.
- Uh, let's not worry about it.

158
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,599
- What happened?
- Nothing.

159
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,310
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- Me too.

160
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,062
Me too.

161
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,731
Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car.

162
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,901
Oh, I have to go pack. Oh!

163
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,987
- And it really does?
- It does.

164
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,281
It really and truly does.

165
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,866
Oh.

166
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,516
It so does not.

167
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,940
She wants me to take responsibility...

168
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,068
...for everything that went wrong
in our relationship.

169
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:40,323
I mean, she goes on for five pages
about how I was unfaithful to her.

170
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,368
We were on a break!

171
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,664
Oh, my God. If you say that one more time,
I'm gonna break up with you.

172
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,499
All right, fine.

173
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:53,044
But this breakup was not all my fault.
And she says here:

174
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,715
"If you accept full responsibility..."
Full responsibility.

175
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,842
"...I can begin to trust you again.

176
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:02,512
Does that seem like something
you can do? Does it?"

177
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,558
No?

178
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,187
Look, Ross, you have what you want.
You're back with Rachel.

179
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,357
You're gonna wreck the best thing
that ever happened to you.

180
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,819
Yeah, I know. I know, you're right.

181
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,447
Yeah, I guess I'll let it go.

182
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:24,033
But you understand how hard it is
to forget about this?

183
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,744
Sure, it's hard to forget...

184
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:29,122
...but that doesn't mean
you have to talk about it.

185
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,332
A lot of things happened on that trip...

186
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,503
...that we should never, ever talk about.

187
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,216
What the hell happened on that beach?

188
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,888
It's between us and the sea, Ross.

189
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,066
- Hi, Ursula.
- Hey.

190
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,320
Okay, well, um, I know that
we haven't talked in a long time.

191
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,490
But, um, okay, our mom
is not our birth mom.

192
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,950
This other lady is our birth mom.

193
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,245
Right, okay, the one that lives in Montauk.
Mm-hm.

194
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,789
You know her?

195
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,793
No. I, um... I read about her
in Mom's suicide note.

196
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,253
There was a suicide note?

197
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,297
Well, do you still have it?

198
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,883
Hang on.

199
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,305
I can't believe you didn't tell me
there was a suicide note.

200
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,724
Yeah, so how have you been doing?

201
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,101
I... Shut up.

202
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,442
"Goodbye, Phoebe and Ursula.
I'll miss you.

203
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,403
P.S. Your mom lives in Montauk."

204
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,781
You just wrote this.

205
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,952
Well, it's pretty much the gist.

206
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,331
Except for the poem.
You read the poem, right?

207
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,166
No.

208
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,752
All right. Hang on.

209
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,884
Pass the cheese, please.

210
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,596
Ugh.

211
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,725
My God, you can't even look at me,
can you?

212
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,352
No.

213
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,147
Yay, it's Phoebe. We can talk to Phoebe.

214
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,443
No, I'm too depressed to talk.

215
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,654
I'll give you $1000 to talk to us.

216
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,031
Hey, you guys...

217
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,118
...what do you think about making
that beach trip an annual thing?

218
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,120
No.

219
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,706
All right, that's it, you guys.
What happened out there?

220
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,251
What? We took a walk.
Nothing happened.

221
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,461
I came back with nothing all over me.

222
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,132
- Come on, what happened? Joey?
- What does that mean?

223
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,259
- All right.
- No.

224
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,469
Joey, we swore we'd never tell.

225
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,805
They'll never understand.

226
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,643
But we have to say something.

227
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,770
We have to get it out.
It's eating me alive.

228
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,193
- Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
- All right.

229
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,740
All right.

230
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,870
I got stung.

231
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,956
Stung bad.

232
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,668
I couldn't stand. I...

233
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,545
I couldn't walk.

234
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,131
We were two miles from the house.

235
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,885
We were scared and alone.

236
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,346
We didn't think we could make it.

237
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,852
I was in too much pain.

238
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,271
And I was tired
from digging the huge hole.

239
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,485
And then Joey remembered something.

240
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,905
I'd seen this thing
on the Discovery Channel.

241
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,657
Wait a minute, I saw that.

242
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:55,370
On the Discovery Channel.
Yeah, about jellyfish and how if you...

243
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,791
Ew.

244
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,501
You peed on yourself?

245
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,503
Ew.

246
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,215
You can't say that. You don't know.

247
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,676
I thought I was gonna pass out
from the pain.

248
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,888
Anyway, I tried, but I couldn't...

249
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,139
...bend that way.

250
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,394
So...

251
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,730
Ew.

252
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,902
That's right. I stepped up.

253
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,074
She's my friend and she needed help.

254
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,035
If I had to, I'd pee on any one of you.

255
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,252
Only, uh, I couldn't.

256
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,841
I got the stage fright.

257
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:54,095
I wanted to help,
but there was just too much pressure...

258
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,222
...so I, uh... I turned to Chandler.

259
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:05,440
Joey kept screaming at me,
"Do it now. Do it. Do it. Do it now."

260
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,111
Sometimes, late at night,
I can still hear the screaming.

261
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,617
That's because, sometimes, I just do it
through my wall to freak you out.

262
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,956
And fuchsia and mauve

263
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:26,627
Those are the 66 colors of my bedroom

264
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,088
Thank you. Thank you.

265
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:33,885
Oh, and I invite all of you
to count the colors in your bedroom.

266
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,263
Except for you. You go away.

267
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,227
I'll go in a second.

268
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,480
I just want to tell you...

269
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:49,442
...that there hasn't been a day
when I didn't regret giving you up.

270
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,778
Okay, bye.

271
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,614
No, I'm not done.

272
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,242
I just want you to know, the reason
I never looked you up was because...

273
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,495
...well, I was afraid that you'd react...

274
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:04,082
...just, well, like the way
you're reacting now.

275
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,543
Can't we just, you know, start from here?
Please?

276
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,671
No.

277
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,426
Okay.

278
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,678
Sorry.

279
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,307
But just one last thing.

280
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,186
You know, you came looking for family.

281
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,189
I'm family.

282
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,983
I'm it.

283
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,613
Well, now I'm done.

284
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:42,120
Yeah, but it's not like
we're losing anything, you know?

285
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,331
Yeah, I guess you're right.

286
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:49,919
It's not like we know each other or anything
or that have anything in common.

287
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:55,383
Oh, I don't know. I mean, it's not like
we don't have anything in common.

288
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,220
I mean, I like, uh, pizza.

289
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,681
I... I like pizza.

290
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,599
You do?

291
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,185
Wait, I like, um, the Beatles.

292
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,854
Oh, my God. So do I!

293
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,064
I knew it. Wow.

294
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,108
Wait, wait, wait. Puppies. Cute or ugly?

295
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,318
- Oh, so cute.
- Oh!

296
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,155
- Well? Ha, ha.
- You see?

297
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,866
But I'm still... I'm mad at you.

298
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,659
I know.

299
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,579
I'm mad at me too.

300
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,583
Well, um, do you want to get
something to eat?

301
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,585
Because I'm kind of hungry.

302
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,545
Hey. Me too.

303
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,965
All right, stop it. Now you're just
doing it to freak me out.

304
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,140
Aw, I missed you.

305
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,392
I missed you too.

306
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:52,273
Oh, I was so nervous about that letter.

307
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,278
But the way you
owned up to everything...

308
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:02,241
...it just showed me
how much you've grown, you know?

309
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,953
I suppose.

310
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:11,209
No. You have, Ross. You have.
You should give yourself credit.

311
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,712
I mean, my mom never thought
this would work out.

312
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,716
Heh. She was all,
"Once a cheater, always a cheater."

313
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,554
- Mm-hm.
- Oh.

314
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,641
I just wish we hadn't lost
those four months.

315
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:32,438
But if time was what you needed
just to gain a little perspective...

316
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,484
We were on a break!

317
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,946
- Coffeehouse?
- You bet.

318
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:44,533
And for the record, it took two people
to break up this relationship.

319
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,827
Yeah, you and that girl
from the copy place...

320
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,580
...which yesterday
you took full responsibility for.

321
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,667
I didn't know what I was taking
responsibility for, okay?

322
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,627
I didn't finish the whole letter.

323
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,796
- What?
- I fell asleep.

324
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,173
You fell asleep?

325
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,927
Yeah, it was 5:30 in the morning.

326
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:08,516
And you had rambled on for 18 pages.

327
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,394
Front and back!

328
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,438
Oh, oh, oh. And by the way.

329
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:18,192
"Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E" means "you are."

330
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,111
"Y-O-U-R" means "your."

331
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:24,323
I can't believe I even thought
of getting back together with you.

332
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,075
We are so over.

333
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,245
Fine by me!

334
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,789
Oh, and hey, hey, hey.

335
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,167
Those spelling tips will come in handy
when you're at home on Saturday nights...

336
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,794
...playing Scrabble with Monica.

337
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,005
- Hey.
- Sorry.

338
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:43,426
I just feel bad about all that sleep you're
gonna miss, wishing you were with me.

339
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,012
Oh, no, no.
Don't you worry about me falling asleep.

340
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,764
I still have your letter!

341
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,728
And hey, just so you know,
it's not that common.

342
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:57,815
It doesn't happen to every guy
and it is a big deal!

343
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,818
I knew it!

344
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,283
Gin.

345
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,244
We were playing gin?

346
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,249
You know, if we were a couple,
we could play this game naked.

347
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,085
- Ha, ha. Would you stop?
- Okay.

348
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,754
All right.

349
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,257
Okay, all right. I think you're great.

350
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,635
I think you're sweet and you're smart...

351
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:27,887
...and I love you.

352
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,683
But you will always be the guy
who peed on me.
