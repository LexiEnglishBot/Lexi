1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,401
 I'd say...

2
00:00:02,101 --> 00:00:03,693
...Cybill Shepherd.

3
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:10,740
So you guys in the movie
or you just really paranoid?

4
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,112
Hey, Sal?

5
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,506
Jerry wants to know
if the monkey's ready.

6
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:16,612
Excuse me?

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,611
Jerry is the director?
Which one's he?

8
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:23,377
- The one in the director's chair?
- Gotcha.

9
00:00:24,123 --> 00:00:26,489
Pheebs, walk with me.

10
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:29,426
Why am I walking with you?

11
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:33,098
We're just going over here
so that we can get away from...

12
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:35,823
...the horrible flesh-eating virus!

13
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,434
For the love of God, woman,
listen to me!

14
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,905
Is he looking? Is he looking?

15
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:49,911
- We've got a problem.
- Tell me.

16
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,514
I can't do Chris' makeup.

17
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,082
She refuses to acknowledge
her mustache.

18
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:57,481
- Is it bad?
- It looks like her eyebrow fell down.

19
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,258
Unless we convince her
to let me bleach it...

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,994
...Van Damme will be
making out with Gabe Kaplan.

21
00:01:04,163 --> 00:01:05,892
I'll talk to her.

22
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:08,127
I hate actors.

23
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:12,937
Nice camouflage. For a minute there,
I almost didn't see you.

24
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,005
Excuse me.

25
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:21,710
Is your name Chandler?

26
00:01:22,014 --> 00:01:23,174
Yes, it is.

27
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:24,513
Chandler Bing.

28
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:28,278
Do you know me or are you
just really good at this game?

29
00:01:28,654 --> 00:01:29,678
I'm Susie Moss.

30
00:01:30,389 --> 00:01:32,323
Fourth grade? Glasses?

31
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:36,085
I carried a box of
animal crackers like a purse?

32
00:01:36,395 --> 00:01:37,327
Susie Moss!

33
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,527
Right! Yeah! Wow!

34
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,695
You look...

35
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:44,431
Great job growing up.

36
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:49,004
It's nice to see you don't still
wear the cap with the mirrors on it.

37
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:52,700
I graduated fourth grade
and realized I wasn't a pimp.

38
00:01:53,212 --> 00:01:54,804
Remember the class play?

39
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:59,381
You pulled up my skirt and the
entire auditorium saw my underpants?

40
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:05,251
Yes. Back then, I used humor
as a defense mechanism.

41
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:07,857
Thank God I don't do that anymore.

42
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,866
What you have been
doing since childhood?

43
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,235
Well, I got a new belt.

44
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,837
I wondered!

45
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,009
- Oh, my God!
- What? What?

46
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,541
It's Jean-Claude Van Damme.

47
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,408
I didn't know he was in
this movie. He is so hot!

48
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,080
You think?

49
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:35,815
The Muscles from Brussels?
Wham-Bam-Van-Damme?

50
00:02:36,088 --> 00:02:37,350
Did you see Time Cop?

51
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:39,022
No. Was he any good in it?

52
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,953
Rachel, he totally changed time!

53
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,064
So why don't you go talk to him?

54
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:50,225
Go tell him he's cute.
What's the worst that could happen?

55
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,728
He could hear me.

56
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,007
- I'm doing it for you.
- Don't you dare! Don't!

57
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,171
Don't!

58
00:02:57,743 --> 00:02:59,370
Tell him I cook!

59
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:01,943
Excuse me.

60
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,878
This is gonna sound kind of goofy...

61
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,954
...but my friend over there...

62
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,790
...who cooks, by the way...

63
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,653
She thinks you're cute.

64
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,719
You don't think I'm cute?

65
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,924
I don't know.

66
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,092
Do you think you're cute?

67
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:29,201
We're getting off the track.
I was supposed to tell you...

68
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:31,703
...my friend thinks you're cute.

69
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,371
What should I tell her?

70
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:38,243
You can tell her
I think her friend is cute.

71
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:03,903
- Makeup!
- That's me. I gotta go.

72
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:12,643
How many times must I touch you on
the arm before you ask me on a date?

73
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,588
Well, let's try one more.

74
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,382
There you go. Ernie's, 8:00?

75
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:21,988
I'll be there.

76
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,958
And if things go well,
maybe this time...

77
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,028
...I'll get to see your underwear.

78
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:35,435
No one was around to hear that?

79
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:42,113
So what'd he say?

80
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,042
What a jerk!

81
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:47,716
I kept talking about you,
and he kept asking me out.

82
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,886
Naturally, you know, I said no.

83
00:04:56,395 --> 00:04:57,225
Thanks, anyway.

84
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,055
He just kept asking...

85
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,162
...and asking, asking, asking...

86
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:04,429
If you want to go out
with him, you can.

87
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,000
Sounds like a jerk to me, but

88
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,300
Jean-Claude, she said yes!
I'll see you tonight!

89
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,480
Thank you.

90
00:05:22,054 --> 00:05:24,614
Then Jean-Claude took me
to Crossroads...

91
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:28,018
...and we hung out
with Drew Barrymore.

92
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,387
Oh, man. She's so smokin'!

93
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,392
She's got the greatest set of

94
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:37,997
No guys around, huh?

95
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:42,371
- Does anybody need anything?
- I'll have an espresso.

96
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,539
I'll get it.

97
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,937
If I ask you to, you'll end up
drinking it yourself.

98
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:52,008
- That is so unfair.
- I know.

99
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:56,153
Like you'd drink her coffee after
what you did to her with Van Damme?

100
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,151
I have to cancel racquetball tonight.

101
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:03,653
Marcel's trainer will let me
have him for a couple of hours.

102
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,658
You're blowing me off for a monkey?

103
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,592
We can reschedule for Saturday.

104
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,597
Unless you hook up
with a bunch of pigeons.

105
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,437
Stick a fork in me...

106
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:16,569
...I am done!

107
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:19,271
Stick a fork what?

108
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,570
Like when you're cooking a steak.

109
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,406
I don't eat meat.

110
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,182
How do you know vegetables are done?

111
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:30,478
Well, you don't.
You eat them and you can tell.

112
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,451
Okay, then eat me, I'm done!

113
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,987
I've met the perfect woman.

114
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,960
We're sitting on her couch,
fooling around...

115
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:43,701
...and then she turns to me and says:

116
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,369
"Did you ever want to do it
in an elevator?"

117
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:48,370
What did you say?

118
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,973
I believe my exact words were...

119
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,840
How do you know if you wanna do that?

120
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,149
You just know.

121
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,654
We gotta go.
Got a reservation in 30 minutes.

122
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:15,756
What I had planned shouldn't take
more than two, three minutes, tops.

123
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,001
Two hundred seconds of passion!
We gotta go.

124
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,729
But...

125
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,405
...here's an idea.

126
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:29,407
Have you ever worn women's underwear?

127
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,146
Well, yes, actually...

128
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,077
...but they were my Aunt Edna's.

129
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:38,990
And there were three of us in there.

130
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:43,386
I was thinking
it would be kind of sexy...

131
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:46,756
...if you wore mine tonight
at dinner.

132
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,598
You want me to wear your panties?

133
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,136
Could you?

134
00:07:55,674 --> 00:07:58,234
If I was wearing your underwear...

135
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:00,374
...then what would you be wearing?

136
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,786
You're swell!

137
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,794
Got the music, got the dinner.

138
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,987
I made Marcel's favorite dish,
banana cake...

139
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:21,188
...with mealworm.

140
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,572
Candle.

141
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:31,571
What do you think's
gonna happen here tonight?

142
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:39,977
Hi, are you on your way over

143
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,920
No, I understand.
A monkey's gotta work.

144
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,523
It's no big deal.

145
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:55,790
It's not like I had
anything special planned.

146
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:17,789
- You feel that?
- What?

147
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:21,416
We passed moment we
should stop holding hands.

148
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:28,895
Rachel, why don't you
start talking first?

149
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:31,761
I feel that this is
totally unjustified.

150
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,097
She gave me the green light,
I did nothing

151
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:40,071
Do you think I can't
see you in the TV set?

152
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,581
If there's something
you'd like to share

153
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:48,409
You had no right to go out with him!

154
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,690
- That's the most ridiculous
- You sold me out!

155
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,789
- I did not!
- You absolutely

156
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,960
Would you let me talk!

157
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,592
Did you just flick me?

158
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:05,134
Well, you wouldn't let me
finish and I was

159
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:08,470
That hurt!

160
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,100
Quit flicking!

161
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,376
Stop flicking!

162
00:10:12,077 --> 00:10:13,237
You flicked me first!

163
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:21,149
Let's not do this!

164
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,657
Happy thoughts!

165
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,329
Now I'm gonna kick some ass!

166
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:50,109
All right. Now, I will
let go if you both stop.

167
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,314
You want me to stop seeing him?

168
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,919
You want me to just tell him
you're seeing him instead?

169
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,215
Is that what you want?

170
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,393
That's what you want?

171
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,194
- Fine!
- Fine!

172
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:10,832
There we go.

173
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:15,666
If we were in prison,
you guys would be, like, my bitches.

174
00:11:23,615 --> 00:11:25,412
Thanks for letting me tag along.

175
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:26,945
Forget about it.

176
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,017
How you doing there, squirmy?

177
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,047
I'm hanging in.

178
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:33,785
And a little out.

179
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,826
So assistant to the director?

180
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:43,966
That's an exciting job. You must
have a ton of responsibilities

181
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,636
I don't do the casting.

182
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,771
So what are you guys gonna eat?

183
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:53,771
How come all I can think about is
putting that ice in my mouth...

184
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:56,879
...and licking you all over?

185
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:02,913
Because I went to an all-boys high
school, and God is making up for it?

186
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,697
I want you right here...

187
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:15,524
...right now.

188
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,395
Right now, right here?

189
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,430
Don't you think we're in
kind of a public place?

190
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:25,042
They do have the shrimp.

191
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,704
Meet me in the bathroom.

192
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:38,086
I'm going to the bathroom now.

193
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,004
Come on.

194
00:13:03,248 --> 00:13:04,613
All right, mister.

195
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,051
Let's see those panties.

196
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:09,743
Alrighty.

197
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,723
But you know what
would be even sexier?

198
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:17,927
What?

199
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,497
If you didn't have
your shirt tucked into them.

200
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:28,763
All right. Now, I would like
to see you wearing nothing but them.

201
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,271
Take your clothes off.

202
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:36,013
I hope you realize this means
we'll miss hearing about the specials.

203
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:38,814
Come on, hurry!

204
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,951
Do you want this done quick
or done right?

205
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:45,923
All right, turn around.
I wanna see you from behind.

206
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:51,022
Somebody's been doing
his Buns of Steel video.

207
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:54,823
So you want me
to clench anything or...?

208
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,068
Susie?

209
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,233
This is for the fourth grade.

210
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,577
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

211
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:10,804
What do I mean?!

212
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,643
I mean underpants, mister!
That's what I mean!

213
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,286
What? What do you mean?

214
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:17,647
My skirt...

215
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,756
...you lifted. IKids laughing!

216
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:23,493
I was Susie Underpants till I was 18!

217
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:28,828
That was in fourth grade!
How could you still be upset?

218
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:34,437
Call me in 20 years and tell me
if you're still upset about this.

219
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:42,979
I hope you realize you're not
getting these underpants back!

220
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:54,686
I can't believe this.

221
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,226
Just two weeks ago,
I was watching Sudden Death...

222
00:14:58,463 --> 00:15:01,762
...and now I'm on a date
with Jean-Claude Van Damme.

223
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,862
Can you beat up that guy?

224
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,072
- Can you beat up that guy?
- Sure.

225
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,331
This is so wild.

226
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:15,846
I gotta admit, I was surprised
that you agreed to go on a blind date.

227
00:15:16,214 --> 00:15:18,011
Normally, I would not do it.

228
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,452
What made you make
the exception for me?

229
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:23,745
Rachel told me...

230
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:27,787
...you were dying to have a threesome
with me and Drew Barrymore.

231
00:15:28,026 --> 00:15:31,154
By the way, Drew has
some ground rules and...

232
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,490
Say you're sorry!

233
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,336
Say it!

234
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,467
No! I'm not gonna!

235
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,574
Say it! Say it!
Great!

236
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:49,779
Say you're sorry
or your sweater gets it.

237
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:54,477
That is my favorite sweater!
That is my third-date sweater!

238
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,588
Say you're sorry.

239
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,393
You wanna play?
Okay, let's play.

240
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:03,683
Let's play.

241
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:10,500
What'll you do?

242
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,567
Give me back my sweater
or it's handbag marinara.

243
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,104
You don't have the guts.

244
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,641
Yeah? At least I wasn't too chicken
to tell some guy he was cute.

245
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,951
Stop! Stop the madness!

246
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,188
This is crazy!

247
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:44,401
Who can remember why
you're fighting in the first place?

248
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,469
Yes, that's right.

249
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:54,471
But still...

250
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,175
Look at your purse!

251
00:16:57,582 --> 00:16:59,482
Look at your sweater!

252
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,417
Look at yourselves!

253
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,882
I'll help you fix your sweater.

254
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:09,591
I'll help you...

255
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,590
...throw out your purse.

256
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,528
I'm sorry I made you stop seeing him.

257
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,529
I'm sorry I went out with him
when I knew you liked him.

258
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:27,411
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves.

259
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,098
Joey?

260
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,266
Ma?

261
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,705
What are you doing here?
I thought you guys took off.

262
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,910
She took off with my clothes!

263
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:06,342
- Are you naked in there?
- Well, not exactly.

264
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,016
I'm wearing panties.

265
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:16,292
You always wear panties?

266
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:20,488
No, no. This is the first time.

267
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,067
Talk about your bad luck!

268
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:29,267
The first time you try panties and
someone walks off with your clothes.

269
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,943
I was not trying them out.
Susie asked me to wear them.

270
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:35,541
Let me see!

271
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,317
No! I'm not letting you
or anybody else see, ever!

272
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,245
All right, all right!

273
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:48,750
Someone's flossing!

274
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,100
Joey, some people don't like that.

275
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,631
Chandler's wearing panties.

276
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:01,939
What?

277
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,409
- Let me see!
- You don't have to see!

278
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,168
Hi, tushy!

279
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,246
One of you give me your underpants.

280
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,516
I'm not wearing any.

281
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,952
How can you not be wearing any?

282
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:23,159
I'm getting heat from the guy
in the hot pink thong.

283
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:28,222
Look, Ross. I'll give you
$50 for your underpants.

284
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,085
- Can I have the milk?
- I'm almost done with it.

285
00:19:58,396 --> 00:19:59,988
Keep your panties on.

286
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,633
And I'm in the movie!

287
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:11,273
- What happened?
- A virus victim called in sick...

288
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:15,639
...so Cathy recommended me and boom!
I'm dying on a gurney!

289
00:20:17,148 --> 00:20:21,050
Marcel just finished his last scene,
if you wanna go say goodbye.

290
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:26,648
That's okay. He's probably
got parties to go to and stuff.

291
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,496
He's moved on.
That's the way it goes, right?

292
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,329
Oh, my God!

293
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,030
What?

294
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,900
Looks like we made it

295
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:49,012
Left each other on the way...

296
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:50,906
...to another love

297
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:58,817
Looks like we made it

298
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:03,050
Or I thought so, till today

299
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:07,024
Until you were there, everywhere

300
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:12,466
And all I could taste was
Love the way we made it

301
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,040
Looks like we made it

302
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:29,042
I'm sorry it didn't work between
you and me. Or you and me.

303
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:31,455
Drew was very disapoited.

304
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:45,500
Well, bye for me too.

305
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,046
Okay, we will bye-bye again.

306
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,351
Perhaps the three of us. Just...

307
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,094
Are you sure, I can
crush a walnut with my butt.

308
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:14,098
No, no, no...
Impressive but no.

309
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,342
Bye, Marcel!

310
00:22:26,077 --> 00:22:27,044
See you on the big screen.

311
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,048
You keep people drinking that beer.

312
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,051
I will miss you buddy.

313
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,475
I think I want to write
a song about all this.

314
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:03,469
Except one of the strings
on my guitar is broken.

315
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:06,683
Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?

316
00:23:06,951 --> 00:23:10,352
- How long you been waiting to
say that? - About 20 minutes!

317
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:20,355
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

318
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:23,466
Cut!

319
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:27,670
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

320
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:30,801
Cut!

321
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:35,701
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

322
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,309
Mommy!

323
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:43,482
Can't you see what's going on?
This man is dead!
